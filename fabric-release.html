lets do this

<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 06 Apr 2017 00:22:08 GMT):<br/>
Yup, adding all the maintainers... and shooting an email.

1. I have added (an initial list of) 35 members, and expect 100s to join.

Hello @here, in the fabric roadmap slide (https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/attachment/10627/Fabric%20Roadmap%20March2017-v6.pptx) I've seen a feature called "Side DB for private data" planned for the release V Next. Could anybody elaborate what is this? Is this for securely storing some encryption keys in the blockchain? Thanks.

@JonathanLevi perhaps we should start with the summary list from your email
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 07 Apr 2017 18:25:32 GMT):<br/>
Hi @binhn, thank you. Sure, let's do it...  I have also put it also here, so that it's easy to comment upon (and track).
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sAsa389InUieQ0DsnVaw9qsPAWoJKZeUwBVf6R2dCD4/edit
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 07 Apr 2017 18:25:50 GMT):<br/>
I plan to start adding sections with the things we all agree on.

<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 07 Apr 2017 18:26:42 GMT):<br/>
(noting, for all, that the Release Strategy and the final vote is for the maintainers... but feedback is welcome)

<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Fri, 07 Apr 2017 18:44:02 GMT):<br/>
it looks like we have 2 camps on release strategy https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sAsa389InUieQ0DsnVaw9qsPAWoJKZeUwBVf6R2dCD4/edit
At this point, i'd prefer to focus on hardening 1.0 before cutting the branch to minimize the distraction.
It is critical that we do these the next 2 weeks (sprint 16) 
- addressing bugs
- usability (easy to bring up a simple network), doc, samples
- performance
We can leverage any help from anyone

@cbf - I see a focus on maintainers in the note. Of course in many development efforts there is a focus on what stakeholders need (sometimes represented by product owners in scrum). So I am curious how stakeholders (and similar) fit into a community process, such as this one.

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 01:33:11 GMT):<br/>
Also - I think there should be a clear path for bringing a contribution in (particularly for those who aren't maintainers) - need to ensure this is encouraged and successful.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 01:34:20 GMT):<br/>
I also think there needs to be improvement to the next release process so that feature development is not blocked for an extended period of time.

@troyronda absolutely, but I see the maintainers responsibility to take user requirements into consideration in their decision-making process

I would like to see stakeholders weighing in on JIRA with comments
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 14:54:43 GMT):<br/>
and votes
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 14:55:08 GMT):<br/>
of course, that can be abused since the JIRA is open... I don't believe that there are constraints on that function
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 14:55:29 GMT):<br/>
bottom line, squeaky wheel gets the grease
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 14:55:39 GMT):<br/>
that is and has always been the case

I am aggressively trying to clean up JIRA for this very reason - right now, there garden has gone to seed and we need to clean up the mess
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 15:00:20 GMT):<br/>
So I think there are different uses of Fabric, and I think a discussion needs to happen on how to ensure these various uses are getting attention & shepherded - there may even be contrasting requirements that need to be fixed - like confidentiality vs analytics.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 15:02:59 GMT):<br/>
(different assumption on the usage of fabric)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 15:03:20 GMT):<br/>
(and different patches applied to fabric to enable them)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 15:07:09 GMT):<br/>
Example: blocks and RW sets being sent to clients might be handy for someone doing analytics but isn't good for those who need confidentiality. https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2679

1) It is naive to believe that we can just keep on merging feature requests at the same time as trying to get to a release / release branch.  Yes - you can continue feature development and you can submit CRs and keep them up to date by rebasing while they are waiting to be merged, but we can't simply merge code which actually changes core files and then attempt to cut a release after that.  We must first get to code complete on the existing set of agreed on features (now how we do a better job of getting the release feature list is part of the release planning document)

2) There may be a mis-use and/or overuse of a specific function when the reality is that perhaps 2 or more features / function are actually needed.  Eventhub is probably the greatest example of that.  So perhaps we need to have clearly defined stories rather than getting into details of implementation and calling that the story / feature.  Let me expand on Eventhub as it is a good example:

At a high level, there are at least 2 separate use cases / requirements being handled by the eventhub implementation:
- client submits a transaction and simply wants to know when that transaction has been committed
- entity who "owns / runs" the peer wishes to integrate the peer with its existing systems

Those are 2 very different requirements and should be treated as such

3) As we move forward, I do think having an initial agreed upon set of features for the next release milestones will be very helpful.  BUT - as @cbf points out - we then need to figure out who is going to implement them.  It's hard to control what people will choose to implement.  Now if we see a group of people ignoring major features the community asked for and just doing their own thing, we can try to address it but in many ways the community will address it by simply leaving and moving on to using something else

4) When considering features, we have to make sure that we are not building a multi-headed, unmanageable and unusable monster.  There are some things which simply are not appropriate for the direction of the "product"

@mastersingh24 - 
1) I hear you, of course. However, when you need to work on the next version - it becomes difficult to collaborate and you just end up with a bunch of patches. And the longer a freeze lasts, the more painful it gets.

2) Yes - this is partly relates to my comment about shepherding characteristics of the system like confidentiality.

4) So when this situation happens, there has to be a careful consideration about sufficient plugability to enable that use case. Stakeholders still need the functionality they are looking for...

for 4) - sure - I think there are some place where plug points are definitely reasonable but you cannot solve every problem or requirement.  Anyone who has ever tired this has built something which fails.

You know I also STRONGLY believe that we cannot build everything into the peer

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 16:02:43 GMT):<br/>
But I think the major thing right now is how we turn the corner.  Unfortunately, we have to reset a bit here and the only way to do that is to slow down now for a bit and get the house in order so we can move forward  :)

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 16:03:15 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 16:05:15 GMT):<br/>
on 4 - yes i know this... however there are major use cases that need to be handled that involve core aspects like data processing and appropriate confidentiality for the deployment.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 16:08:08 GMT):<br/>
And features that are about multi-organization confidentiality, privacy, consistency and data segregation need a path forward :)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 16:08:22 GMT):<br/>
yeah - but that does not mean it all has to be done in a single process I guess is my point

Sure but the plugin point can execute something in another process. But the point remains that it needs to exist

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 16:09:03 GMT):<br/>
Sure but the plugin point can execute something in another process - depending on the case. But the point remains that the plugability needs to exist when something is in the middle of the processing flow.

Hello @troyronda, @mastersingh24, ...:

[Putting aside Constellation, PGP, the peer, etc. for now.] I want to focus back for a moment on the argument against focusing only on stabilizing the current `master` branch (ironing out the issues there and making it more stable).

We need to make a call, and I don't want to miss important feedback/input. 2 quick questions:

1. Other than @troyronda, how many people (maintainers, who are also people, included. Is any of the maintainer who) believe that in the coming 6-8 months, we should work on more than stabilizing the 1.0 branch?
2. @troyronda and others, what are the high level points / reasons for preferring 2 branches these coming weeks?

When did the idea of 6-8 months get floated?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:25:33 GMT):<br/>
Am I right that the main concern is that if we all focus only on Fabric 1.0 during (say, ) April/May, we may lose contributions from other developers that would really like new features to get merged "now" ?

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:25:52 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanLevi it lets developers that want to run ahead do so on master, remaining enganged
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:28:19 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanLevi other developers end up with patches in the ether
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:30:18 GMT):<br/>
OK, I think I see - so the argument is that *the main concern is that if we all focus only on Fabric 1.0 during (say, ) April/May, we may lose contributions from other developers that would really like new features to get merged "now" - and they may end up with patches in the ether* ?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:33:05 GMT):<br/>
I would like to also bring a little bit context. We are lucky to have a relatively diverse group of maintainers - and each of us has an area of familiarity.
I should tell you that almost any maintainer told me that he believes that there is *so much work to do* in order to really test and stability the 1.0 branch...
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:33:40 GMT):<br/>
At the same time (and I don't mean to offend anyone - just stating a fact): *we still seem to break the APIs*
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:34:14 GMT):<br/>
[*break* as in *improve, enhance, solidify* of course ;-) ]
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:34:16 GMT):<br/>
The issue is that 1.0 isn't feature complete
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:34:16 GMT):<br/>
The issue is that 1.0 needs additional features for use cases that focus more on confidentiality

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:34:38 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:34:39 GMT):<br/>
1.0 isn't feature complete and not even API frozen, almost.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:34:47 GMT):<br/>
I mean from the current scope
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:35:04 GMT):<br/>
we already have patches in the ether
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:35:22 GMT):<br/>
Sorry I'm being boring: Are we talking now about *adding missing featuers* to 1.0 or to, say, Fabric 1.2  ?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:35:24 GMT):<br/>
Feature complete from who's perspective?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:35:31 GMT):<br/>
(one sec, Gari)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:36:22 GMT):<br/>
I'm talking about 1.1 or 1.2
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:36:24 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanLevi perhaps fabric could consider something like the plan here for moving from M0->RC?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:36:36 GMT):<br/>
I'm trying to laser-zoom/focus: what is the biggest issue/concern?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:36:40 GMT):<br/>
New featuers for 1.1 ?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:36:42 GMT):<br/>
based on the current scope of 1.0
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:37:01 GMT):<br/>
yes new features for 1.1 due to the current definition of 1.0
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:38:16 GMT):<br/>
OK, so you have a few suggestions/features that are not part of the 1.0 roadmap (current, immediate plan).... and you would like to start merging these new features into some public repository, while `Fabric 1.0` is being worked out?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:39:05 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 - adjusted my wording - sorry for the confusion
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:40:09 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanLevi - looking for suggestions on this, yes
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:40:46 GMT):<br/>
OK, no problem. That's what I'm trying to understand.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:41:21 GMT):<br/>
So in order to make a (my, at least) suggestion, I need another data point:
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:42:01 GMT):<br/>
(And some bumped features like TCerts)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:42:01 GMT):<br/>
Why would you not rather wait just a bit until we fix the not-so-stable-yet fabric 1.0 branch?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:42:11 GMT):<br/>
The timeline is too long
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:42:11 GMT):<br/>
The timeline is too long (6-8 more weeks of freeze)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:43:02 GMT):<br/>
But 1.1 will be released in months to come (if not more), anyway... wouldn't it?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:43:27 GMT):<br/>
I am interested on what the release cadence is anticipated to be
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:43:28 GMT):<br/>
So it is not as if we will release F 1.1 on May 1st... 
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:43:44 GMT):<br/>
Sure but the longer it takes to start means the more it pushes
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:44:16 GMT):<br/>
what is the hard deadline for cutover to 1.1
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:44:22 GMT):<br/>
or is it open-ended
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:44:28 GMT):<br/>
Well, the concern I have (for you) is that, say you "branch out"... and in the coming weeks, we start merging heavily (like we normally do close to releases)....
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:45:11 GMT):<br/>
You will end up (re)solving so many issues, with "merging up" from Fabric 1.0 - Release Candidate 1 (for example)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:45:18 GMT):<br/>
... into your "feature branch"
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:45:32 GMT):<br/>
(that you can share amongst a few devs).

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:46:16 GMT):<br/>
Mind you, that as part of the plan/release strategy we are also trying to consider/evaluate/estimate/allocate `resources`.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:46:26 GMT):<br/>
So look - I'm saying there is no hard schedule here - there is open-ended bug fixing
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:46:58 GMT):<br/>
Well, we are trying to "harden it". That's why I'm collecting all this info...
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:47:19 GMT):<br/>
Binhn suggested a schedule, Gari provided feedback, etc... 
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:48:41 GMT):<br/>
We are looking something like (at it is up to the voting, etc.):
- Around 4-6 more weeks of dev/tests for the core features
- 2 Release Candidates (mid-May, end of May)
- Beta/Release cut (around June)
</p>

Enabling a privacy & confidentiality focused deployment needs 1.1 so this makes it hard
</p>

Not carved in stone as are still planning.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:49:30 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:49:52 GMT):<br/>
At this point, we are trying to harden and release the best `1.0` we can.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:50:23 GMT):<br/>

Troy, I am 200% with you. You know I also run a product that provides/brings extra features to the game.

<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:52:14 GMT):<br/>
(HACERA) - but we have our own build, CI, tests, schedule...
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:52:27 GMT):<br/>
... and we adjust it to the Fabric 1.0 roadmap (at this point).
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:52:43 GMT):<br/>
BTW - there was a note sent to the mailing list from Chris about some of this stuff but I never really saw any additional responses
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:52:50 GMT):<br/>
I can't foresee what will happen at the end of Q4 2017. Trying to work out with the resources we currently have.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:53:05 GMT):<br/>
yikes - end of Q4?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:53:05 GMT):<br/>
End of Q4? I was wondering if there would be a faster cadence 
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:53:08 GMT):<br/>
(e.g., Hyperledger's CI)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:53:33 GMT):<br/>
I'm just saying: I'm not running polls now about Fabric 1.1.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:54:29 GMT):<br/>
This is the issue with open-ended timing on releases i guess
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:54:36 GMT):<br/>
ok - I think we have sorta moved off subject (although still related)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:55:06 GMT):<br/>
it would be good to have somewhat predictable cadence between releases
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:55:08 GMT):<br/>
(not arguing, btw): trying to develop/understand why suggesting that you work with a feature branch (in the coming weeks)... will not solve the issue.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:55:34 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=6auR39bhJiTwT6Qxe) How is this related to the question?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:57:05 GMT):<br/>
Troy: I am not arguing, btw, merely trying to develop/understand why suggesting that you work with a feature branch (in the coming weeks)... will not solve the issue.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:57:19 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda  - it's hard to do that if you don't have the somewhat planned list of features which would comprise some type of cohesive "release"  - but I agree that it is somewhat doable.  You can say that you'll put out a point release every 2 months and that means you have let's say 6 weeks to develop a cohesive set of features.  If you don't make the window, you are pushed to the next release
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:57:46 GMT):<br/>
I'm totally fine with a 2 months cycle.
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=4XHu2kT7iMaR4ro6z) 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:57:57 GMT):<br/>
that was just an example
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:58:12 GMT):<br/>
(yes, understood)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:58:23 GMT):<br/>
You might also have to classify features as incremental versus massive change
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:58:34 GMT):<br/>
I'm pinning down the specific question about the current "state":
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:58:43 GMT):<br/>
We don't yet have a set of frozen APIs.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:58:45 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:59:06 GMT):<br/>
right - and "we" had set a target of getting to the point by the end of this month
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:59:07 GMT):<br/>
Having 2 CIs now working on two branches.... (up)merging strategies, etc....
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:59:07 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda: Yes, *I am sure you appreciate that it does not come for free*. E.g., setting up now 2/parallel CIs now working on two branches.... [(up)merging strategies, etc. issues/sprints/JIRA ticket management/priorities/) that is with all the required/associated coordination.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:59:23 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanLevi - didn't intend to say solve or didn't solve.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:59:52 GMT):<br/>
Troy, if you like, I can put it forward to a "vote"... 
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:00:12 GMT):<br/>
I need to know if there are others that share the same concern/view of yours... ?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:00:51 GMT):<br/>
Let me give this a try:
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:05:12 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanLevi - we also deal with these issues already - yes (CI, merging upstream, ...)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:05:55 GMT):<br/>
1) Do most people agree that we will need to cut release branch(es)?     (I had a proposal that we always have 2 branches - master and the current major release branch)

2) Assuming that people agree with 1), then you have to agree when the right time to cut a release branch is.  My proposal had been that we do that when we declare all features are complete and APIs are frozen and other than major exception we are then in bug fix only mode

3) At the point we cut the release branch, we can then open up the master branch for feature development (ideally for features that are on some type of list of planned features so people know what is being worked on)

4) This mean new code goes to master and bug fixes will need to go to both the release branch and master  (at least until we actually get the "final" release out the door)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:07:05 GMT):<br/>
BUT - in the meantime, nothing would prevent someone from submitting a patch that is not a v1.0.0 feature at this time for people to review and also to actively keep it up to date over the coming weeks while we get to API / feature complete and cut a 1.0.0 branch
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:07:19 GMT):<br/>
That was my proposal
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:07:27 GMT):<br/>
So in a line: *master is the "cutting-edge" stuff, and we "down-merge" from the "latest" to "1.0" when we believe that it's important enough?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:07:31 GMT):<br/>
Anyway - that's the type of thing we need to vote on
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:08:32 GMT):<br/>
OK. So to "quantify" a little bit: of the 100% developers we have now:
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:08:41 GMT):<br/>
actually - bug fixes would be targetted at 1.0.0 and "up-merged" to master (or maybe you could do it the other way around - I guess any fixes needed for 1.0.0 branch need to make it to master)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:08:51 GMT):<br/>
- How many "new features" that are 1.1 and not 1.0 are we expecting?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:09:19 GMT):<br/>
for the record, we (IBM) would likely focus 90+% of our resource on 1.0.0
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:09:20 GMT):<br/>
That is, what percentage of the "workforce" in the coming 6-8 weeks, will work on the "next, next version"?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:10:05 GMT):<br/>
Because most of the burden will now be the "down-merge"/test.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:10:28 GMT):<br/>
So we would have 90-100% of IBM people working on getting to feature / API complete for the current set of 1.0.0 features
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:10:48 GMT):<br/>
We can keep master at `1.0` and have 90%+ of the IBMers, and say 75% of the Hyperledger fabric deveopers working on master.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:10:53 GMT):<br/>
Then the top priority after that would be testing and fixing bugs on 1.0.0 across a couple of release candidates
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:11:28 GMT):<br/>
And,say, the 25% enthusiast that work on the next features - will need to keep in synch with the "getting-stabilzed" master branch.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:11:28 GMT):<br/>
And,say, the 25% of the other developers/enthusiasts that work on the next features - will need to keep in synch with the "getting-stabilzed" master branch.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:11:54 GMT):<br/>
if we are able to triage bugs correctly, we should not get into too big of a mess merging bugs fixes to the release and master branches
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:12:01 GMT):<br/>
Informally, this is what we do in HACERA. We really don't work with the nightly "master" branch.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:12:28 GMT):<br/>
We take a weekly snapshot, develop on top, and frequently merge the new additional stuff from "master" into our local branch.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:12:38 GMT):<br/>
so Docker uses a master branch and a release branch
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:12:48 GMT):<br/>
(so the burned is on the person who "merges")
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:12:56 GMT):<br/>
(and of course they use tags as well for historical purposes)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:13:23 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:13:25 GMT):<br/>
BUT
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:13:32 GMT):<br/>
We can use the docker model - but, all, remember, their codebase is more stable.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:13:40 GMT):<br/>
(I honestly don't have a strong opinion)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:13:49 GMT):<br/>
We merge weekly here. I can tell you this.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:14:10 GMT):<br/>
I fetch master, merge to a local branch, run everything, and only then "vendor" fabric.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:14:30 GMT):<br/>
It's probably the same "work-flow"
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:14:58 GMT):<br/>
in the interim, let's say we are still on master (until feature / API complete) and we are not merging non v1.0.0 features.  I think that if people want to submit v1.1 or later features to master, go ahead although we won't merge them.  They would need to keep them up to date and perhaps this might even help with making the changes more modular and less invasive  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:15:13 GMT):<br/>
I also hate vendoring  :(
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:15:20 GMT):<br/>
Ok, focus ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:15:49 GMT):<br/>
Troy: works for you?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:16:00 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 - how do you deal with patches that depend on each other
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:16:26 GMT):<br/>
write better code  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:16:35 GMT):<br/>
the patches will look huge
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:16:53 GMT):<br/>
that's all fine and good when merge happens soon after
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:17:53 GMT):<br/>
(which i assume is why branches become needed)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:18:07 GMT):<br/>
Troy, my two cents here: we can vote - but even if it is approved that others would like to work with 2 version in parallel in the coming 6-8 weeks...
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:18:32 GMT):<br/>
... remember that you won't be really able to make *huge* changes to the 1.1 API in the interim.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:18:36 GMT):<br/>
if a stack of patches is the incremental development of a feature, then it should not be too difficult to manage this.   if 2 new features depend on each other and you stack patches, I think that is bad.  I think that's where you need to do a better job of defining interface / function boundaries
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:19:01 GMT):<br/>
Because you won't be able to merge.... that's where the bigger challenge is.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:19:04 GMT):<br/>
BTW - I don't support 2 branches until we call 1.0.0 feature / API complete
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:19:17 GMT):<br/>
which should be in the next couple fo weeks
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:19:17 GMT):<br/>
which should be in the next couple of weeks
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:19:22 GMT):<br/>
How much can you really "push" in 1.1 while 1.0 is not "stable"...
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:19:50 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I agree. We much "freeze" first (at least the first milestone)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:19:50 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I agree. We must/should "freeze" first (at least the first milestone)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:19:58 GMT):<br/>
Indeed
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:20:07 GMT):<br/>
Else we will NEVER get to where we want to be
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:20:26 GMT):<br/>
we should be pretty close
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:20:28 GMT):<br/>
Troy, it's actually an advice.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:20:31 GMT):<br/>
It's the 6-8 + weeks part that bothered me
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:20:56 GMT):<br/>
You may end up ("figuratively") working with, say a team of 20 people... on 1.1 features.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:21:21 GMT):<br/>
While needing to merge/consolidate 80-100 contributers/contributions a week.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:21:52 GMT):<br/>
I would rather fork/branch only in a few weeks...
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:22:13 GMT):<br/>
... (with anything post 1.0)... but that's just from what I have seen around here.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:22:33 GMT):<br/>
I also think we need to do a MUCH better job of modularizing the code in certain areas.  So maybe if we can get to the 2 branches we can work on this as well as we see how invasive bug fixes are 
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:22:33 GMT):<br/>
Gerrit some gets FLOODED with fixes, closer to milestones!
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:23:52 GMT):<br/>
I appreciate your guy's efforts on thinking about this - we're all trying to get to the same place
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:24:37 GMT):<br/>
I'm just caught a little bit on certain aspects
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:25:05 GMT):<br/>
Troy: NP. In addition, show me the JIRA tickets for the features for 1.1 (and not 1.0) 
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:26:12 GMT):<br/>
(you are not disturbing. I'm just trying to give this enough weight/consideration - in case we need to vote)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:26:33 GMT):<br/>
I see. So final question about it from me, I believe:
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:27:00 GMT):<br/>
How will having a `fabric-1.1.-dev` branch with a CI help you?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:27:24 GMT):<br/>
(And do you believe we should run it ourselves? HL Fabric? The LInux Foundation, etc.?) 
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:27:39 GMT):<br/>
(just in the coming, say 4-6 weeks)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:28:01 GMT):<br/>
I guess there are two things at play.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:29:05 GMT):<br/>
1) determining how things will be accepted when 1.1 opens up; 2) depends on if others start on some 1.1 features
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:29:49 GMT):<br/>
Yes, please share with me the JIRA tickets?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:30:38 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 20:30:58 GMT):<br/>

@JonathanLevi - Do we have already a decision about the "supporting 2 versions/branches/sets of CIs"? Can you please share?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 23 Apr 2017 12:30:00 GMT):<br/>
@MichalMalka  - Not yet - but there's a new proposal on the table which was sent to the mailing list.  It has not been finalized and no decisions have been made, but here's the link for reference and please add any comments / concerns:   https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZQYEAET3o_tVDzTC218b_J1AkpHM30TnLTx0YMfegec/edit?usp=sharing

Hi @MichalMalka , and everyone - yes, I appreciate that there are several ongoing threads over these, . I am actually working to summarize these (and will send out an update or two... as a good portion of the Hackfest in DC is dedicated to these)

Hello, I have several questions about the release and performance of hyperledger/fabric.  I started working on v0.6 in october 2016, now migrating the project to v1.0-alpha.  1) when fabric v1.0 will be stable enough to use in production mode ?  2) Should I start a project on v1-alpha and upgrade it after or wait till stable v1.0 is released ?  3) What is the number of maximum peers that fabric can handle ?

Hi @aybekbuka The maintianers need to decide on exit criteria for Hyperledger-fabric v1,0 and are not declaring a date yet. I would start using the alpha, but I think they are planning on cutting a new alpha or potentially calling it Beta.  3) The maximum number of peers is really dependent on the type of chaincode, the number of endorsers.  There is going to be more system type testing happening over next 2 months where I think we will get more details on this aspect of performance.

<p><strong>mffrench</strong> (Mon, 08 May 2017 11:46:55 GMT):<br/>
a little question regarding fabric binaries release
</p>
<p><strong>mffrench</strong> (Mon, 08 May 2017 11:48:15 GMT):<br/>
the getting starting doc say to download them with following command :

```
curl -L https://logs.hyperledger.org/sandbox/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-2/fabric-binaries/release.tar.gz -o release.tar.gz 2> /dev/null;  tar -xvf release.tar.gz
```
</p>
<p><strong>mffrench</strong> (Mon, 08 May 2017 11:48:45 GMT):<br/>
but unfortunately this return an error :

<p><strong>mffrench</strong> (Mon, 08 May 2017 11:51:24 GMT):<br/>
Is there another new download address ?
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 08 May 2017 12:18:07 GMT):<br/>
I guess that's bcoz URL doesn't exist 
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 08 May 2017 12:18:07 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>mffrench</strong> (Mon, 08 May 2017 12:19:08 GMT):<br/>
yes. I'm trying to get the new one ;)
</p>
<p><strong>mffrench</strong> (Mon, 08 May 2017 12:19:23 GMT):<br/>
if exists
</p>
<p><strong>mffrench</strong> (Mon, 08 May 2017 12:19:51 GMT):<br/>
I'd like to download the released cryptogen and configtxgen tools
</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 08 May 2017 12:20:39 GMT):<br/>
Can you try `make release` inside `fabric` for now until the above it fixed.

yeah sure I can
</p>
<p><strong>mffrench</strong> (Mon, 08 May 2017 12:21:10 GMT):<br/>
but I try to avoid dependency on the fabric dev in my script in fact
</p>
<p><strong>mffrench</strong> (Mon, 08 May 2017 12:21:52 GMT):<br/>
so I'll wait ;)

</p>
<p><strong>harsha</strong> (Mon, 08 May 2017 13:13:53 GMT):<br/>
Can you try this ?

FYI, (from @weeds) Announcement: We hold a quick scrum call on Monday, Wednesday, Friday for Hyperledger-Fabric. The dial in for today at 9:30 EST is 1-888-426-6840 with passcode 33682113. We review what has passed or failed out of the daily build from CI, the highest priority bugs that must be addressed, CR's that need special attention from maintainers, unit test coverage, and serviceability. Also at the end of the call, developers sometimes talk about additional technical questions that should be addressed to stabilizing release where interlock needs to occur. We also try to take notes as best we can in the fabric-peer-endorser-comitter channel for those that are not able to attend or are in a geographical location that is not a good time for them to dial in.

@binhn these are MUST HAVE... absolutely positively no way can we cut a release without these CRs that need to be merged?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 08 May 2017 18:52:11 GMT):<br/>
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8853/ is failing on power, but builds cleanly on X and Z
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 08 May 2017 18:58:15 GMT):<br/>
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8905/ is SDK, is this absolutely necessary? It says in review but in reality being reworked
</p>

<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 08 May 2017 19:51:22 GMT):<br/>
Fair enough - yes, let's see what do we need to do in order to cut an `alpha2`.

BTW: I'm collecting all the issue I am aware of (and/or hear about) here: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3040
Trying to help us all to collect everything we are aware of (for v1.0.0) in one place, including Java SDK.

Similarly, it does not have the granularity/differentiation between `1.0.0-alpha2` and `1.0.0`(yet).

Please chime in (if you are aware of more issues). Also, please keep in mind that we are still trying to release an `alpha2` sooner rather than later... as we really need a good round of meaningful feedback from new/existing users who try the latest.

@cbf 8905 and 8995 are both requested by the composer team. 8905 should be really close with remaining work in updating the tests; 8995 not further work expected just waiting for https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9059/ to make the build green again

Hello EveryOne , Could you please let  me know which version of Fabric-SDK-node is stable version of v1 ?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 13:05:27 GMT):<br/>
Hello @akash42145, Fabric v1 has not been released yet. There was a `v1.0.0-alpha` tag, and we are about to cut a `v1.0.0-alpha2` this week (give or take a day).
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 13:06:05 GMT):<br/>
The upcoming `v1.0.0-alpha2` which will include the SDK Node, will include the latest cut from the `master` branch.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 13:06:53 GMT):<br/>
(we are in a *feature-freeze* mode)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 13:07:17 GMT):<br/>
You are more than welcome to try it out and provide feedback/ask questions.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 13:07:37 GMT):<br/>
(or wait until we tag the alpha2 very soon)
</p>
<p><strong>nickmelis</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 13:50:30 GMT):<br/>
will the Java SDK be included in alpha2?
</p>
<p><strong>nickmelis</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 13:50:30 GMT):<br/>
will the Java SDK be included in alpha2? Not very clear from the comments in FAB-3040

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=A4LYSceXp7uFWK3Ro) @nickmelis this one makes the answer to your question disturbing; https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3850 
</p>
<p><strong>nickmelis</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 15:51:27 GMT):<br/>
@HansDeLeenheer I believe FAB-3850 is about Java chaincode, bad news anyway.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 16:21:31 GMT):<br/>
Yes, sorry about the bad news regarding the Java CC - as per the Jira ticket - despite the good progress wrt the Java SDK, we do not feel that is it quite ready yet.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 16:22:05 GMT):<br/>
I still feel that the SDK Node is a lot more mature, which is why I voted in FAB-3040 the way I did.
</p>
<p><strong>nickmelis</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 16:22:17 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanLevi is there going to be an alpha3 too?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 16:23:21 GMT):<br/>
The plan is to release a baseline (alpha2), and keep the API locked/frozen. If we feel that it is stable enough (subject to feedback from the wider community), our next milestone is actually a *beta*.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 16:24:49 GMT):<br/>
So the short(er) answer is "hopefully not". But let's see. We are trying to do the best we can to incorporate in `v1.0.0-alpha2` everything we are aware of, while releasing it shortly.

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 11:28:01 GMT):<br/>
created a task that we can use to track the process of cutting the release
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 11:28:55 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins @mastersingh24 @binhn @JonathanLevi and anyone else please weigh in 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 11:29:24 GMT):<br/>
I think we just need to merge the two JavaCC CRs and the changelog CR and we can begin the process of cutting the release
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 12:51:25 GMT):<br/>
I think until we have the CI mechanism in place to manage the branches, just KISS and manage this like we did the last one
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 12:51:51 GMT):<br/>
that is keep single branch (master), cut/tag alpha2, and continue one with master frozen
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 12:51:51 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 12:52:25 GMT):<br/>
if we end up needing "alpha2.1" we can retro cut a branch from the tag
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 12:53:08 GMT):<br/>
IOW, I am not a fan of implementing the "develop" branch strategy until we hit 1.0 GA
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 12:55:49 GMT):<br/>
well, some want to develop for 1.1
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 12:55:55 GMT):<br/>
eg post 1.0
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 12:56:25 GMT):<br/>
understood, and that is precisely why I say "dont do it", heh
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 12:56:26 GMT):<br/>
note that I am not a fan of this, and it would mean frequent rebases, but there is demand (not from IBM I might add)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 12:56:32 GMT):<br/>
LOL
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 12:56:47 GMT):<br/>
that is exactly what happened in v0.6
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 12:57:18 GMT):<br/>
people went nuts with the v1.0 stuff and were completely out of sync with what was being carefully curated for v0.6
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 12:57:38 GMT):<br/>
the merge was a multi-day nightmare that @muralisr and I had to slog through
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 12:58:14 GMT):<br/>
if the v0.6 were trickling out CR by CR to the master branch (by some automated CI merge process, for instance) it wouldnt have been bad
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 12:58:29 GMT):<br/>
but because we waited weeks/months, it was a headache
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:00:02 GMT):<br/>
so, for lack of a sufficient merge process in place to manage that correctly, my suggestion is the far more conservative thing is to just keep things simple...one branch, its frozen, only v1.0 targeted CRs go in
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:00:47 GMT):<br/>
users that want to hack on v1.1 can do so with a bajillion other options (working in github, for instance) but the main point is this model would crowdsource the merge work
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:01:24 GMT):<br/>
each group working on a featurebranch would have the impetus to keep up with gerrit::master, rather than have someone like Murali and myself have to resolve _everyones_ featurebranch at once
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:03:32 GMT):<br/>
In case its not clear: I understand the ask and the proposed model...i just dont think we are ready to use it yet
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:14:17 GMT):<br/>
well, don't disagree, but I do think that there is value in having master be always stable release
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:14:46 GMT):<br/>
eg have the default branch from git clone always be stable
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:14:55 GMT):<br/>
in case people choose to go that route
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:15:18 GMT):<br/>
so I can see cutting a branch that becomes develop, and then locking down master
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:15:54 GMT):<br/>
@rjones can probably work some magic that we can restrict access to master branch (he asks)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:15:54 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:18:58 GMT):<br/>
@cbf we probably could do that (differential access to merging on branches) but I'm not sure what you mean. do you mean people couldn't push to refs/for/master, for instance, unless they were in the list?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:19:19 GMT):<br/>
yes, restrict who can push
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:19:24 GMT):<br/>
to master
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:19:27 GMT):<br/>
(into master)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:19:50 GMT):<br/>
to the maintainers only?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:19:56 GMT):<br/>
@rjones, it's more like a merge up into master.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:20:13 GMT):<br/>
think that makes sense if we could (and if we agree to have master and develop)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:20:15 GMT):<br/>
So that nobody actually works directly against (the new) master.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:20:21 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:20:25 GMT):<br/>
always stable
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:20:50 GMT):<br/>
we could still lock down develop until post 1.0
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:21:02 GMT):<br/>
and that I think would make @greg.haskins happy
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:21:04 GMT):<br/>
I'll ask how we can support this, but perhaps walk the idea around on the mailing list a little?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:21:34 GMT):<br/>
we're going to end up asking people to essentially abandon any pending changes on master RN
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:21:44 GMT):<br/>
which is quite a few
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:21:45 GMT):<br/>
and by lock down, I mean limit which FABs can get merged that are not bug fixes
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:22:02 GMT):<br/>
yes, but they can repush to develop
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:22:25 GMT):<br/>
and we could modify the git review setup instructions to push to develop
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:22:35 GMT):<br/>
refs/for/develop that is
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:26:24 GMT):<br/>
I'll see what it would take.

[But this was not due to branching really - it was due to many other factors.  The biggest of which is that 1.0 should have been fresh  :( ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=RjxzMLRHNW6kxufux) @greg.haskins

I'm trying to follow this, but I'm clearly missing something

<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:29:41 GMT):<br/>
ultimately it was though
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:30:23 GMT):<br/>
i understand what you are saying @mastersingh24 ...v1.0 was a major re-write...but there was plenty that was carry over and plenty of conflict was just in the common substrate
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:30:26 GMT):<br/>
in any case...

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:30:50 GMT):<br/>
TBH I think creating a `release` branch that is carefully curated, with changes that land on `release` being cherry-picked to `master` would be a more straight forward mechanic, but really it's all just pointers
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:31:06 GMT):<br/>
but what do you think about having a stable master and develop branch for the 1.0 end-game?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:31:16 GMT):<br/>
So how is it that projects like Kafka and Docker manage to do this?  Certainly they are not smarter than us
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:31:22 GMT):<br/>
@rjones: i really think you have to do it that way
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:31:28 GMT):<br/>
How far are we code-wise from alpha2 until V1.0 ? Does anyone have any estimate? I think that's the key here with regard to Greg's concern no?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:31:44 GMT):<br/>
CF moved from master to develop and master == just published releases
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:31:49 GMT):<br/>
the main thing I am asking for is to make the "cherry-pick to master" be automated, because the manual mode in gerrit is terrible at this
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:32:12 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm just 3 CRs I think and they are all ready to merge
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:32:18 GMT):<br/>
(and by automated, I dont mean that a computer makes a unilateral decision

<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:32:29 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:33:36 GMT):<br/>
Let me plug the "long game":

1)  We put out a 1.0.0 release
2) We start working on 1.X release
3) People start using 1.0.0 and file several bugs which need to be fixed
4) We want people to be able to release 1.0.X patch releases which are based on 1.0.0 release
</p>

4) We want people to be able to release 1.0.X patch releases which are based on 1.0.0 release

If you have an active branch where new features are being added, you can't take a cut of that and call it 1.0.X
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:34:17 GMT):<br/>
I think the question comes down to: how long between releases?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:35:11 GMT):<br/>
if the period between releases is short, we just have to deal with urgent fixes which per @dhuseby would be merged directly from a branch off of master
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:35:24 GMT):<br/>
Wait, these are all the stories for V1.0.0? @cbf  I don't see Gossip mutual TLS there 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:35:25 GMT):<br/>
and also to develop
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:35:32 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins do you care about the difference between a merge and a cherry pick? on my previous project I did a merge once a day or so, unless there was a conflict
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:35:43 GMT):<br/>
@rjones: no
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:35:55 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm I never said that - just look at blockers for now
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:36:00 GMT):<br/>
that is alpha2 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:36:03 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:36:28 GMT):<br/>
So my point is simple:

1) Keep a release branch where you only apply fixes and cut patch releases - it - keeps rolling out 1.0.1,1.0.2,...,1.0.N

2) You have the active development branch

3) Fixes get applied (if relevant) to both
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:36:32 GMT):<br/>
we still have to decide on 1.0
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:36:36 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins so I could just add that as something I do every day (the merge) and we could move on
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:36:56 GMT):<br/>
@rjones: main concern is to avoid having either a situation where two branches inadvertently diverge and then need a bulk conflict resolution after a period of time
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:37:05 GMT):<br/>
Can I ask one question? (I feel like 4 people are typing)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:37:06 GMT):<br/>
You are not always going to be able to atuo merge fixes for 1.0.X to 1.N development branch
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:37:07 GMT):<br/>
the only time that gets tricky is when version numbers are added
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:37:16 GMT):<br/>
How can they diverge?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:37:24 GMT):<br/>
If you look at my option(s)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:37:43 GMT):<br/>
too many threads, heh
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:37:44 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins so long as we apply the patches to release also to develop, we should be good
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:37:47 GMT):<br/>
Indeed
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:37:55 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:38:36 GMT):<br/>
@cbf correct...i am just saying that unless there is some automation the "as long as we apply" part is tricky in gerrit
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:38:37 GMT):<br/>
I think we should focus today only on `alpha2`
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:38:54 GMT):<br/>
That is, I am very happy to just tag the latest code that we are happy with.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:39:04 GMT):<br/>
Then, get a branch/CI job to run in the background.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:39:17 GMT):<br/>
we need to publish a release, not just tag
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:39:21 GMT):<br/>
It's totally find (from my end) to have a few days of a total freeze.

<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:39:21 GMT):<br/>

@mastersingh24 I totally agree with the model that I think you are eluding too...
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:39:31 GMT):<br/>
that means images, maven, npm etc
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:39:40 GMT):<br/>
Yes, and have that release off a branch, that is tracked, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:39:46 GMT):<br/>
The whole thing, yes.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:39:55 GMT):<br/>
can have a v1.0.x branch were only v1.0.x fixes go in, and not all of those fixes belong in v1.1
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:40:18 GMT):<br/>
Realistically, it is difficult to work with gerrit and "dynamic" feature branches.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:40:27 GMT):<br/>
[Yes ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=x6uQejSN23Q6dJxqR) @greg.haskins 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:40:30 GMT):<br/>
note that for alpha2, I don't see a need for alpha2.1 we can just do alpha3 
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:40:34 GMT):<br/>
We can pre-set a few of them... and have the workflow around these.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:40:37 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24: but do note this: _some_ of those fixes _do_ belong in v1.1...
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:40:43 GMT):<br/>
Yes, alpha2, alpha3, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:40:44 GMT):<br/>
we don't need to treat alpha2 like a 1.0
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:40:44 GMT):<br/>
correct
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:40:54 GMT):<br/>
and without some order, it will get hard to keep track of whether it was done or neglected
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:41:04 GMT):<br/>
We just want all the 1.0 stuff to be in "one direction" so that we converge.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:41:29 GMT):<br/>
right...and to be clear, I think we totally need something more diverse than one branch after v1.0 is cut
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:41:38 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins  - we seem to manage this fine for IBM products
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:41:52 GMT):<br/>
I think it's impossible to have an automated process for merging fixes for both branches like @greg.haskins wants, but I think it's worth to somehow make a "policy"/"protocol" that ensures that both go into both branches, and at the same time it won't be a big "stress" on the maintainers.
I think this can only be done if we try to avoid merging to master, unless it's a must. 
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:41:53 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24: how?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:41:59 GMT):<br/>
i just think that right now, we are not sophisticated enough to manage more than one branch and its not critical to support v1.1 folks
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:42:03 GMT):<br/>
I'm failing to understand why having a stable master is not a good thing
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:42:37 GMT):<br/>
what is critical is a quality v1.0 release
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:42:42 GMT):<br/>
therefore, KISS
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:42:51 GMT):<br/>
I'll give you an example:

When I worked on DataPower, we supported N-2 versions at any given time.   If a bug is filed against any of those versions, the person who triages and/or fixes the bug determines for which releases it is relevant

I'll give you an example:

When I worked on DataPower, we supported N-2 versions at any given time.   If a bug is filed against any of those versions, the person who triages and/or fixes the bug determines for which releases it is relevant

We then submit the fix against the 3 branches (we use Perforce) and then release it in the appropriate patch release for each version
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:43:01 GMT):<br/>
IMO, the experience that one gets from building or just using published images should be the same or we will go crazy with trying to figure out which software people are using when they file a bug
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:43:17 GMT):<br/>
That's for sure.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:43:29 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:43:48 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 thats the model that I've always used too...the problem here is how gerrit works
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:44:00 GMT):<br/>
or at least, how we use it
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:44:25 GMT):<br/>
in most projects ive worked on, thats exactly what weve done...developer targets the right branch and then merges out as appropriate
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:44:38 GMT):<br/>
but here, with our gerrit setup, gerrit makes that awkward
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:44:40 GMT):<br/>
[ I'll admit that I don't understand everything that was in your note about gerrit and how we use it / what it is capable of](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=iDsyaFu95u8waY42X) @greg.haskins 
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:45:04 GMT):<br/>
so think of it this way
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:45:16 GMT):<br/>
we currently do not allow merges between branches (and for a good reason)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:45:44 GMT):<br/>
so in order to do the model that you and I are talking about, a user has to submit a CR against all relevant branches
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:46:02 GMT):<br/>
correct - we have to do that here at IBM typically as well
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:46:20 GMT):<br/>
it gets tracked in the defect netry
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:46:20 GMT):<br/>
it gets tracked in the defect entry
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:46:24 GMT):<br/>
whats worse, even if you can get people to be dilligent about this and not make mistakes....you have other problems
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:46:36 GMT):<br/>
for instance, the CR may be accepted in one branch but not another
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:46:52 GMT):<br/>
even if its accepted in lockstep, its not easy to see the relationship of the patch
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:47:09 GMT):<br/>
Right - fixes are not going to always be 100% compatible across release boundaries
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:47:12 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins this should be rare
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:47:16 GMT):<br/>
(it looks like a discrete commit in each branch from gits point of view)

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:47:45 GMT):<br/>
Sure - but JIRA could / would tie it all together
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:48:12 GMT):<br/>
so it becomes really hard to answer questions like: was the patch applied in all branches it should be applied in?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:48:19 GMT):<br/>
So @greg.haskins  - what would you propose?  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:48:31 GMT):<br/>
in @dhuseby model, only CVEs are merged against master (release, whatever) - these are merged with develop as needed and you FF merge develop into release 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:48:43 GMT):<br/>
JIRA should be the source of truth IMHO when it comes to tracking things
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:48:48 GMT):<br/>
y
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:49:59 GMT):<br/>
I have a side question about this 2 branch split - could we make an automated process in CI (like a merge job) that "simulates" a merge between dev and master?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:50:02 GMT):<br/>
@cbf yes, i understand his model (I think)...its really not any different than, for instance, having a v1.0.x branch and a master branch
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:50:14 GMT):<br/>
We could "detect" early that something is "wrong"
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:50:39 GMT):<br/>
in either case, you have this notion that some branch is more delicate and only gets very targeted patches
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:50:56 GMT):<br/>
Otherwise we'll come to the day when we need to "use" the development branch and nothing would work at all and go find the problem
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:50:58 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins right but my point is that there should be relatively few of these
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:51:16 GMT):<br/>
other fixes get bundled into the next release
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:51:17 GMT):<br/>
the issue is that in my experience, things that are appropriate for the targeted branch have a reasonably probability of bring appropriate elsewhere

</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:51:45 GMT):<br/>
and the gerrit model (or our use of it) makes it really hard to ensure that is happening properly
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:52:18 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins so @mastersingh24 asked what you would propose then...
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:52:37 GMT):<br/>
IMO, a single branch is not doing us any favors
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:52:50 GMT):<br/>
so yes, we could say "we'll be super careful and make sure we merge it everywhere" but that makes it a human process and thus inviting mistakes
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:52:59 GMT):<br/>
ones that are really easy to make
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:53:26 GMT):<br/>
so, what I propose is:

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:53:32 GMT):<br/>
actually it could be automated
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:53:35 GMT):<br/>
Of course humans program the automation as well - and a bad automated process wreaks more havoc than a error prone manual one  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:53:47 GMT):<br/>
between now and 1.0 GA, just consider master frozen and a single stream
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:54:00 GMT):<br/>
you could have a bot cherry pick any merges that were not ff to master/release
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:54:55 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 yes, of course...but by that argument, everything is subject to that
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:55:12 GMT):<br/>
the main point is: computers are good at rote tasks like monitoring something consistently
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:55:26 GMT):<br/>
so I am not saying we need a fully automated merge process
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:55:29 GMT):<br/>
right, SMOP
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:55:46 GMT):<br/>
OK so - @greg.haskins :

1) between now and 1.0 GA, just consider master frozen and a single stream
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:55:48 GMT):<br/>
but what would be minimal, i think, is some way to at least detect that a human needs to intervene
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:56:17 GMT):<br/>
e.g. a dashboard on jenkins that goes RED when the master branch has a patch that develop doesn.t
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:56:33 GMT):<br/>
so, and let's be clear here, what I am proposing is actually not different, but it does provide a stable master branch
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:56:35 GMT):<br/>
and the maintainer can make a decision to cherry-pick or "merge -sours" it out
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:57:02 GMT):<br/>
from now until 1.0, we update master exclusively via FF merges from develop
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:58:01 GMT):<br/>
@cbf i see what you are saying
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:58:44 GMT):<br/>
the plumbing is in place for develop->master flow but they are kept in sync since develop is just our frozen v1.0 track?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:58:48 GMT):<br/>
what does that buy us though?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:00:40 GMT):<br/>
aside from the seeming futility of turning this one now (I might just need to better understand), the other concern I have is that IIUC, most things that you would want on "stable branch" should be developed against stable branch and merged out, not the other way around
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:00:40 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:00:42 GMT):<br/>
ok, @mastersingh24 reminded me we can choose the default branch on GH, so we could cut release for alpha2, change default to release and that would be less disruptive
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:01:26 GMT):<br/>
trying to cherry pick something from the "everything goes" branch to the "stable branch" is suboptimal and should only be used as a last resort
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:01:44 GMT):<br/>
e.g. someone fixed something in the development stream that was then later deemed critical for the release stream
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:01:46 GMT):<br/>
no, I wasn't suggesting that
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:02:20 GMT):<br/>
Let me pull up Dave's chart.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:02:23 GMT):<br/>
that was @dhuseby feature branch idea - not sure it will work for us until we get our house in order
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:03:27 GMT):<br/>
https://i.stack.imgur.com/F00b8.png
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:03:48 GMT):<br/>
Something around this.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:03:55 GMT):<br/>
anyway, I am not against any of these ideas in general...my only argument is we dont need them _right now_
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:04:12 GMT):<br/>
The idea is that we let soem stuff "sit" in a branch, see that it works... and only the "merge up"
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:04:13 GMT):<br/>
single stream development towards v1.0 is fine, IMO
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:05:10 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanLevi yeah, i fully support that
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:05:10 GMT):<br/>
That's what I mean by "one way" yes.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:05:32 GMT):<br/>
this is in line with what i have been saying for a while...that "gerrit submit" should just be the front stage of the pipe
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:06:01 GMT):<br/>
right now, human submits CR, other humans approve CR, its live
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:06:03 GMT):<br/>
Here's the big elephant in the room .......
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:06:09 GMT):<br/>
I'm also in favor of "auto-reverting" stuff that's not working.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:06:14 GMT):<br/>
and maybe with stable ABI we are ok .....
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:06:20 GMT):<br/>
Go SUCKS with versioning
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:06:31 GMT):<br/>
with that model, the "humans approve" part should just be the first gate...
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:06:38 GMT):<br/>
I used to believe it just sux.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:06:39 GMT):<br/>
;-)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:06:49 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanLevi we cannot do that (auto-revert) until the tests don't yield false positives like every other build
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:06:54 GMT):<br/>
If we can make it such that for 95% of the folks who use alpha2 they NEVER need to clone, go install, etc, then we are good with a single branch
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:07:40 GMT):<br/>
So the delivering the binaries of the tools will likely help and as long as we don't break chaincode then we should be ok
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:08:18 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins  - ^^^^^
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:08:52 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=ZD38fR8kQYPqynFxz) True, but this is something that we should aspire to achieve.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:09:36 GMT):<br/>
At the moment, we don't even trust the `passing` tests ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:09:46 GMT):<br/>
(because of coverage, etc. etc.)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:09:50 GMT):<br/>
ok, for alpha2 there is no urgency to cut a branch, but I still maintain that a stable branch as default on GH is a Good Thing(tm) and will make our lives easier when people file bugs when they built themselves from a git clone
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:09:59 GMT):<br/>
But let's get back to @mastersingh24's thread.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:11:32 GMT):<br/>
Just to qualify a bit what I said above (for getting the attention) - I like to KISS, and not wait or create a dependency on CI jobs, re-branching and changing the workflow "today".
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:11:32 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:11:44 GMT):<br/>
(so in that sense, I agree with Greg)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:11:55 GMT):<br/>
ok, I can live with this for TODAY
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:12:00 GMT):<br/>
I would love to get a tag today. Yup.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:12:00 GMT):<br/>
I would love to get a tag *today*. Yup.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:12:25 GMT):<br/>
I suspect that the CI job(s), servers, redirecting CRs... will take a few days.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:13:46 GMT):<br/>
But at the same time, we do need "release" branches, in my opinion. I'd just rather have that work begin "off the main track" at this point.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:13:53 GMT):<br/>
Absent from this discussion is 'feature toggles', I thought the industry was moving in that direction to support continuous release with release trains of targeted features.  So one master with everything, and no merge hell.  Easier said than done, but worth some thought.  For example there is some 1.1 Side DB work starting, and we could easily merge the component pieces and unit tests into master without exposing any of it to live 1.0 code paths.  Again, easier said than done but worth some thought at least on a feature by feature basis.

FAB-3737 generate changelog for v1.0.0-alpha2 IN REVIEW
FAB-3218 Sync Java/Golang ChaincodeStub interface IN REVIEW
FAB-3850 don't allow Java CC access for alpha2 as its not quite usable yet. IN REVIEW
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:14:33 GMT):<br/>
the three FABs above are the last of the blockers for alpha2
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:14:41 GMT):<br/>
all ready (I believe) to be merged
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:14:50 GMT):<br/>
@here do we agree to merge these?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:16:29 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=NNf6bu2nzXzBynuGX) @dave.enyeart Thats the direction I would like to go in as well.. But to your point, "easier said than done" and we are even further from that than managing the branches properly.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:16:50 GMT):<br/>
ok, just wanted to ensure it was on the radar
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:18:25 GMT):<br/>
It's impossible to have toggle-ed features in some subcomponents @dave.enyeart 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:18:56 GMT):<br/>
yeah, that's why i suggest feature by feature basis where feasible, to minimize the merge hell
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:19:28 GMT):<br/>
@cbf +1 to merging FAB-3737, FAB-3218, FAB-3850
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:20:11 GMT):<br/>
(apologize for jumping in the discussion!)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:20:30 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr no apology needed

</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:21:17 GMT):<br/>
I'd like @greg.haskins to look at https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9167/
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:24:09 GMT):<br/>
and we need to get that merged so that we have a link to add to the commit message to create the release
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:25:00 GMT):<br/>
otherwise there won't be release notes (or a sort) - I at least want to have the changelog linked from the releases page
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:27:05 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr effectively fab-3850 negates fab-3218, so why should we merge fab-3218?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:28:58 GMT):<br/>
@binhn I think we need 3850 regardless, to your point
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:29:09 GMT):<br/>
@binhn  with https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8529/, what we are really merging is FAB-3235 ... it is the last item for fab-3218
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:29:23 GMT):<br/>
I don't think it makes a difference if we do or don't merge Luis's CR
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:29:58 GMT):<br/>
not to users or code path, true
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:30:36 GMT):<br/>
its just that  FAB-3218 is an umbrella for many checkins all of which have been merged
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:30:39 GMT):<br/>
yeah, 8529 is all java, so would not make any difference
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:30:43 GMT):<br/>
except FAB-3235
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:31:30 GMT):<br/>
why leave out a low-impact straggler that'll effectively close the umbrella FAB
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:31:59 GMT):<br/>
ok, i agreed to merge those
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:32:33 GMT):<br/>
anyone else want to weigh in? I think we can merge all three
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:32:43 GMT):<br/>
s/can/should/
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:34:57 GMT):<br/>
Let's wait for @greg.haskins to look at https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9167 then?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:35:16 GMT):<br/>
ok, pushing the button on JavaCC ones 
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:35:27 GMT):<br/>
Yes. I feel like we should merge.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:35:50 GMT):<br/>
patch looks fine...only question is: when/how is it run?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:36:13 GMT):<br/>
i guess it should be run by whomever makes the IS_RELEASE=true CR?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:38:58 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins right now, it would be as you suggest, and the updated CHANGELOG.md would be part of that commit and the commit message would (in addition to whatever else) include a link to the changelog
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:39:27 GMT):<br/>
ok, sounds good
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:39:48 GMT):<br/>
i just +2'd it
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:40:14 GMT):<br/>
thx
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:40:17 GMT):<br/>
need 1 more
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:40:46 GMT):<br/>
Hallelujah ?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:40:46 GMT):<br/>
I have just merged the 3rd one. Hallelujah ?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:40:52 GMT):<br/>
(part 1)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:41:01 GMT):<br/>
then I think one of us can create the tag and we can start the process of producing a published alpha2 release
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:46:24 GMT):<br/>
ok @greg.haskins you want to do the honors and tag and create the IS_RELEASE CR?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:46:51 GMT):<br/>
sure thing
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:46:54 GMT):<br/>

Guys..I checked out the code today and using mac..I think the e2e_cli is broken
Pulling orderer.example.com (hyperledger/fabric-orderer:latest)...
ERROR: manifest for hyperledger/fabric-orderer:latest not found
ERROR !!!! Unable to pull the images
Pulling cli (hyperledger/fabric-testenv:latest)...
ERROR: repository hyperledger/fabric-testenv not found: does not exist or no pull access
ERROR !!!! Unable to pull the images
I think couple of images are missing..I tried download docker images and it installed the orderer latest..but the fabric-testenv is not available..
Any suggestions about the what is the stable and working release we should use that includes e2e clu

want to update the docker-compose.yaml in the release-triggering CR so it'll correspond to the alpha2 versions
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 21:35:32 GMT):<br/>
`x86_64-1.0.0-alpha2` sounds about right?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 21:35:35 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix it's going to be this.. https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9303/1/Makefile
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 21:36:22 GMT):<br/>
hmm, guess that'll create a problem with the CI job
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 21:36:22 GMT):<br/>
hmm, guess that'll create a problem with the CI job for s390
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 21:36:40 GMT):<br/>
ARCH is based on the system you are running..
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 21:37:10 GMT):<br/>
once images are published.. the tag for x86_64 should `x86_64-1.0.0-alpha2`
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 21:37:42 GMT):<br/>
understood, i just realized we can't realize tag it in the docker-compose.yaml used by node SDK end2end 
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 21:38:06 GMT):<br/>
because it'll be used by both x86 and s390 builds

@JonathanLevi @binhn @cbf @greg.haskins @mastersingh24 Don't merge any changes before we release alpha2 docker images.. Below are the changes we have to make to do this

1) Create a new tag for alpha2 or
2) keep both fabric and fabric-ca repos back to alpha2.. I mean revert this change https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/commit/2470d3505cb736b267d4a1b2404e3b90975397db
3) once fabric and fabric-ca repos are ready with alpha2 commit changes and IS_RELEASE=true then will trigger release jobs manually by removing Gerrit ref spec from CI job.

@rameshthoomu the release was already cut and merged.  I just need to push the tag which should trigger the docker push

<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 14 May 2017 14:40:47 GMT):<br/>

no.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sun, 14 May 2017 14:41:11 GMT):<br/>
you will create tags for this release right.. 
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 14 May 2017 14:41:16 GMT):<br/>
Yes

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sun, 14 May 2017 14:41:29 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 14 May 2017 14:42:23 GMT):<br/>
But they are now I believe.  I'll push tag later today

Awesome.. Ty
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sun, 14 May 2017 14:43:42 GMT):<br/>
also you will create tag based on this commit https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/commit/6b6bfcfbd1e798a8a08fa9c3bf4dc0ff766a6b87 correct ? not on latest commit... 
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 14 May 2017 14:47:33 GMT):<br/>
Yes,  tag is always applied to the commit that says "release" 
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Sun, 14 May 2017 14:48:29 GMT):<br/>
Applying it to HEAD would generally be wrong on a few different levels

@JonathanLevi did take a look at 9367 thanks Jonathan... one thing that we did a while back for alpha release is we had the following link in Hyperledger: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric/proposedv1alphacontent      .  Do you think we need to produce something similar or update it to reflect Alpha2?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 16:54:12 GMT):<br/>
so much of this should really be in the documentation itself- so I'm not quite sure if needed or not, which is why I was asking for an opinion.

@jimthematrix I assume that by not being feature complete you are referring to SDKs?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 17:46:15 GMT):<br/>
or just the lack of effective tooling
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 17:46:44 GMT):<br/>
because I will say that at some point, you have to fish or cut bait, and we agreed that we are at code freeze

@jimthematrix @cbf @JonathanLevi  - 

1) From a runtime perspective - peer, orderer, fabric-ca - we are feature complete.  We may have to fix/harden some things, but there's no new features / API/ABI changes

2) I think we are OK with some hardening of the SDKs now that the runtimes are finally complete

3) We do need tooling to support configuring the ordering service (specifically for updating channels, etc).  This will not involve any changes to the the runtimes / ABI and will be a separate / standalone tool.  I believe this is what @jimthematrix  is referring to above and I don't think anyone has an issue with finishing the work on this tool?

Please let's open JIRA tickets for these?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 17:55:06 GMT):<br/>
I want to formalize and have the description/scope....
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 17:55:08 GMT):<br/>
right but this is about making the statement in release notes that we are feature complete - I think it is an important statement to make and that it should be made

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 17:56:06 GMT):<br/>
I agree. It's a big thing to be feature complete + we want to evaluate our beta-readiness pretty soon too (so locking API/ABI is indeed key).
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 17:59:22 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanLevi apparently there is a JIRA that was just added to FAB-3040
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 17:59:55 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix @mastersingh24 we really need to discuss and agree on changes like this
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 18:00:35 GMT):<br/>
this is one case where that discussion may have happened, but I never saw it nor had any say, and AFAIK, neither did @JonathanLevi 
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 18:02:19 GMT):<br/>
Yes, sorry, I wasn't aware. OK, looking.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 18:03:38 GMT):<br/>
as release managers, you'd think that that would have been expected
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 18:04:04 GMT):<br/>
I should probably also send a proper email about that bit too ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 18:04:09 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 18:06:36 GMT):<br/>
I did not update FAB-3040  - I am simply stating the fact that FAB-1678 is needed for most of the channel functionality to be useful and that work is underway on it.  
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 18:08:48 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 sorry if I made it seem as if you did, was just intending to draw your attention

@rameshthoomu I thought that we had a process for publishing native binaries for configtxgen and cryptogen

@rameshthoomu I thought that we had a process for publishing native binaries for configtxgen and cryptogen to nexus
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 18:09:46 GMT):<br/>
we need to do that and provide a link to Nick for his update
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 18:11:01 GMT):<br/>
yes we have a CI job in sandbox to do that.. This patch has to merge to publish from production CI https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8939/
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 18:11:42 GMT):<br/>
Working on this... Will publish one from sandbox for now..

@cbf I added FAB-1678 to the list in FAB-3040 in response to @JonathanLevi 's suggestion, but maybe I was over-zealous...

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 18:43:19 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix no worries, let's just formalize a process going forward
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 18:43:52 GMT):<br/>
this is one of the things that post 1.0 we want to firm up, but we can certainly start applying now to the 1.0 epic
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 19:13:29 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanLevi with respect to your earlier comment for alpha 2. I did see content listed in 9303, 9307, and now 3075.  I had not seen FAB-3075 until later this AM, and I think it fits what i thought had been reflected in proposedv1alphacontent.  I wanted to make sure we had something that told people what you could and could not do with the alpha2 cut.  I will track that JIRA - THANKS!
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 19:14:49 GMT):<br/>
NP. BTW: At this point, I'm mainly trying to collect and gather all the stuff that we know that is needed for 1.0, and wanting to make sure that really are "feature complete"...

I’ve just tested end-to-end (Getting Started) on alpha2 and it was not a good experience.  There were several blocking problems with the end-to-end instructions and docker-compose that need to be fixed for alpha2. Luckily @nickgaski  and @AdnanC  already had work in progress in gerrit, and with a couple small tweaks to them I was able to get things going. These both need to be reviewed/merged as soon as possible:
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3947 https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8981/ e2e_cli (Getting Started) instructions do not work
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3733 https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9107/ Getting Started (e2e): Does not work with CouchDB 
After the docs are merged in FAB-3947, they will be used as the basis for Getting Started in FAB-3925.

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 12:04:47 GMT):<br/>
Is there an overlap/contradiction? Shall we consider all three?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 12:04:48 GMT):<br/>
Thank you.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 12:05:08 GMT):<br/>
no overlaps.  Agreed that we should consider all.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 12:05:26 GMT):<br/>
Noted, thanks.

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 13:20:13 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for merging these two quickly!

<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 13:51:06 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu Ramesh based on these new merges- we will have to repost the new images on dockerhub when you guys are ready
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 13:53:40 GMT):<br/>
@weeds I don't think we have to publish docker images.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 13:54:03 GMT):<br/>
I was mentioning about alpha2 fabric binaries to nexus
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 13:56:59 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu I think it's the docker compose piece that had an update.. how does that get published?
</p>
<p><strong>bkvellanki</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:06:36 GMT):<br/>
@here can we use alpha2 now?
</p>
<p><strong>bkvellanki</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:08:50 GMT):<br/>
@here is it better to stick with alpha.1 . We are doing a prototype and was wondering if alpha 2 has any major issues respect to fabric peer, orderer ..Not worried about e2e tests
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:10:39 GMT):<br/>
I'd recommend *alpha2* (which was cut yesterday)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:10:40 GMT):<br/>
@bkvellanki  - alpha2 is the way to go
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:11:15 GMT):<br/>
But it is the way forward (indeed), as it also has a lot of bug fixes, most likely the final API, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:11:23 GMT):<br/>
I agree with @mastersingh24.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:11:23 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:25:31 GMT):<br/>
we need one final CR to incorporate the new tarball hosted on nexus.  This will essentially be the e2e_cli folder.  And then I will use the end-to-end.rst file with an updated curl command to retrieve the artifacts.  Waiting on ramesh's CR
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:26:17 GMT):<br/>
What is the CR number?

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:46:47 GMT):<br/>
are we allowing defects for alpha2 during this code-freeze period @cbf @JonathanLevi ? if so will there be a notification on what those are ? 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:46:58 GMT):<br/>
maybe they are tagged and I'm just missing it ?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:47:53 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr you mean against alpha2 that need another release?
</p>

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:49:23 GMT):<br/>
file JIRAs yes, fix bugs, sure... we will start merging fixes very soon
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:49:29 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:53:00 GMT):<br/>
Yup. Whatever is clearly in 1 + 2, can go in. When in doubt, let's all chat.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:08:04 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanLevi but how do we "chat" ? RC is a rotating replicated log and it's hard to track.
Maybe we can do something as follows?
A code submitter opens a JIRA and submits it to #fabric-pr-review . He/She can also upload a patch set if it's ready.
If the item belongs to category (3) in one of the maintainer's opinion, He writes in the gerrit item (if such exists) that he proposed to discuss that on JIRA.
Next maintainers would then go to the JIRA and express their opinions. 
Once a write-quorum (how many?) votes on getting this in, the CR can be reviewed on gerrit.

It may be useful to actually categorize way before Gerrit.
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:11:48 GMT):<br/>
can we look at current list and decide on what needs to go in ? There's enough to keep us busy till alpha2 freeze can be lifted IMO :-)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:13:11 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm: With enough information at the JIRA stage/ticket... we should see, given the steps to reproduce, etc... whether it is really not in group 1 or 2, and require to vote. @greg.haskins suggested the JIRA vote... (which, btw, seems plausible to me).
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:13:42 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr: let's have everything (we know of) in FAB-3040... we actually are merging things.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:14:28 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=iHw8onBbwsCwj5HiM) @dave.enyeart : both are merged.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:14:36 GMT):<br/>
(thank you)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:14:58 GMT):<br/>
I don't think we should categorize way before gerrit for items 1 and 2. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:15:09 GMT):<br/>
That's an overhead we don't want to pay IMO
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:16:29 GMT):<br/>
I, too, do not want to prematurely optimize. We can evaluate this new proposal... and I'm happy with your 3 groups/categories.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:17:28 GMT):<br/>
We do need more information in JIRA (than we used to before), but I'm fine with anything that's logical and reasonable.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:18:18 GMT):<br/>
There may be cases that are really straight-forward, that we can categorize right away in JIRA, and others that we may need to (re)categorize after the implementation is examined.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:19:00 GMT):<br/>
All I'm trying to say is, and maybe I'm not clear - If I (or anyone else) am/is working on an item that's clearly (1) or (2) I shouldn't need approval to start working on it 
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:19:30 GMT):<br/>
Oh - then I'm 100% with that. Yes. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:19:33 GMT):<br/>
So we might get to cases where a maintainer sees the JIRA and the gerrit change set at the same time :)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:21:01 GMT):<br/>
I was thinking/focusing on when do we need to vote... and that "It *may* (=sometimes) be useful to actually categorize way before Gerrit." Thanks for clarifying.

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 16:47:13 GMT):<br/>
Probably missing half the conversation - but there are plenty of bugs entered in JIRA already and we know that there are missing UTs.  I am ok with entering a *new* JIRA item for adding UTs (since likely there are no entries).  But other than that, unless there is a new bug discovered as part of fixing a bug, beefing up UT or that comes in from our users, we should not be opening new JIRAs and working on them.  There are plenty of tickets to handle already
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 16:49:27 GMT):<br/>
I think the maintainers are generally good at following the guidelines, we just need to make sure others do as well.   I also think beefing up UT is some areas will help us as we fix bugs
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 17:00:57 GMT):<br/>
++ mastersingh24  a good example of the tests that people are asking to check in is what you see in pr-review channel

@yacovm's category 1 and 2 includes: new/revised tests, whether UT or FVT etc, documentation, and fixes that don't affect production code
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 18:24:43 GMT):<br/>
it also includes critical bug fixes which are not overly complex

it also includes critical bug fixes to production which are not overly complex
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 18:25:26 GMT):<br/>
these, we will just handle as usual. Maintainers check that the JIRA is referenced, review for completeness and merge etc
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 18:27:29 GMT):<br/>
for type 3 maintainers should flag the JIRA and/or CR as such and we can label the JIRA for discussion
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 18:27:59 GMT):<br/>
then we can have a daily discussion on those so tagged
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 18:27:59 GMT):<br/>

Hi all, I've just tried to write, build, and deploy a hello world chaincode by following the documentation on alpha 2 and would like to share my experience here.  I am a Fabric beginner. 

In my case (Getting Started) section was not really useful once I realized that it does not explain how to setup a dev environment and build fabric.  In the appendix I found the sections "Setting up the dev env" and "Building the fabric".  I continued there.  
For Java chaincode developer the prerequisites section may mention Java 8 already here.  

Ok, build successful what's next?   Starting a network, jumping back to "Getting Started" and searched for how to start a network without docker. No luck.  Ok, by just looking in build/bin I realized there is my orderer and a peer.  I started the orderer and a single peer by trail and error approach.  At some point I also realized that I can configure them using the config files in sampleconfig.  Nothing about that in the documentation.  Ok, orderer and peer are running.    Let's deploy an example chaincode. Back in the "getting started" section I followed the description how to install and instantiate some chaincode, in my case example02. At some point it worked.  

Next, writing my own hello world chaincode.  It seems the current documentations has currently no "getting started writing your own chaincode" section. But an outdated version is still in the repository (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/Setup /Chaincode-setup.rst).  In particular, the description still contains the "old" chaincode deployment model (with peer chaincode deploy instruction).  In particular, the description still contains the old chaincode deployment model with peer chaincode deploy instruction.)

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 12:07:31 GMT):<br/>
Mac, MAC is something that is related to #fabric-crypto 
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=YNkwqgAowpSfWmNzp) @bur I agree with you that guidance is lacking right now
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 12:10:29 GMT):<br/>
This doesn't look like a *Mac* specific problem, @elli-androulaki 
</p>
<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 12:10:54 GMT):<br/>
Could be, but i only tested it in MAC.

<p><strong>elli-androulaki</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 12:10:54 GMT):<br/>
Could be, but i only tested it on a MAC; let me know if you think the title is misleading and needs change

@bur not that this helps you per se, but I had proposed this: https://github.com/ghaskins/hyperledger-fabric-alpha2-challenge to try to rally the maintainers to ensure the process you are trying to do is well documented and easy
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 12:11:35 GMT):<br/>
but that process has only just begun

@here    This message went out to the hyperledger-fabric mail group.  Comments are appreciated.    Hello,

The functional and system automated regression tests are being checked into the https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/test/regression folder and the associated tools are in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/test/tools.

The objective is to have daily, weekly, and release tests to run as per the naming convention (daily/weekly/release).   The results will be published in Jenkins under a view with the corresponding name (daily/weekly/release).  The name of the test will contain high-level information including - what the test does and the associated Jira item.  If the reader wants more details they can inspect the Jira item .   In the Jira item there will be a detailed test description with details on the artifacts needed for the test (client driver, associated files, etc).  

This is somewhat in PoC mode as we haven't been able to get CRs merged, so Ramesh created the link in a sandbox and cherry-picked the CRs.   Here is the Jenkins view,
https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/sandbox/job/daily/test_results_analyzer/, now click the 'expand all' button in the top right of the page (we are trying to make this the default).   The results are clearly shown (PASS/FAIL/SKIPPED) and log files will be available (wip).  Let's walk through an example.  Scroll down under the ledger_lte tests and you will see, "test_FAB_3870_VaryNumParallelTxPerChain".   The name gives some indiction of the test, but if you want more information you can go to the Jira task, FAB-3870 (https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3870) which uses a test template and describes the test and artifacts associated with the test.   The goal is that the reader can see the test from a high level, or drill down into the code itself.   This is a WIP and all comments are welcome.

Greg Haskins had a thread last week on creating a new repository for fabric integration work.   We are open to what the community decides and could easily port the work to a new repo if necessary.

Thanks for reading.

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 14:44:40 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu , @mastersingh24 was asking for per-platform downloads on nexus, is that possible?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 14:45:47 GMT):<br/>
yes this script will do that https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8939/20/jjb/fabric/include-raw-fabric-push-fabric-binaries.sh
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 14:46:01 GMT):<br/>
so there will be a link per platform?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 14:46:04 GMT):<br/>
I thought it did but was not sure
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 14:46:22 GMT):<br/>
And do we have an example of the new package(s)?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 14:46:35 GMT):<br/>
and for my testing I have posted binaries to sandbox.. Will delete these once we publish to releases
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 14:46:47 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 check this link https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/snapshots/sandbox/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-2/fabric-binaries-x86_64/
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 14:48:18 GMT):<br/>
these platform specific tarballs are packaged with cryptogen, configtxgen and e2e_cli folder
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 14:48:33 GMT):<br/>
to run e2e_cli tests without cloning fabric repository
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 14:55:26 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu Now that I see the tarball content, I understand that the docker-compose volume mapping that I changed a few days ago will not work, will need to update that:
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 14:55:27 GMT):<br/>
        - ../chaincode/go/:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 14:56:53 GMT):<br/>
I know understand why example02 was copied to be within /examples/e2e_cli
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 14:57:06 GMT):<br/>
I will need to copy marbles02 in there as well, since Getting Started references both of them
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 14:57:08 GMT):<br/>
yes.. these are build on top of old commits.. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 14:58:38 GMT):<br/>
no, we still have a problem, the updated path in the docker-compose will not work with the tarball.  i will need to update the path in docker-compose to be consistent with tarball
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 14:59:34 GMT):<br/>
can example02 and marbles02 chaincode examples be copied into tarball at build time, instead of maintaining two copies in source
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 15:01:25 GMT):<br/>
currently we have two copies in source: /examples/chaincode/go/chaincode_example02 and /examples/e2e_cli/examples/chaincode/go/chaincode_example02
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 15:01:45 GMT):<br/>
that doesnt make much sense... would be better to copy the chaincode examples into tarball at build time
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 15:01:51 GMT):<br/>
yes we can do that.. but are we testing marbels in e2e_cli?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 15:02:25 GMT):<br/>
yes both.  example02 is done first, and then in the Using CouchDB section of Getting Started we use marbles02
</p>

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 15:02:36 GMT):<br/>
(couchdb query requires json)
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 15:24:46 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart Do you want me to publish tarballs on latest fabric commit?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 15:26:12 GMT):<br/>
yes, we made fixes to e2e_cli instructions and docker-compose scripts after alpha2.  Therefore for instructions and docker-compose to work, we need to use latest e2e_cli material rather than alpha2.  
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 15:26:23 GMT):<br/>
The latest docker compose uses mapping of:
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 15:26:30 GMT):<br/>
- ../chaincode/go/:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 15:26:57 GMT):<br/>
Therefore when you copy example02 and marbles02 into tarball, you will have to use this path
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 15:28:02 GMT):<br/>
After today, we can also delete the copy of example02 from e2e_cli source, since you will be copying /examples/chaincode/go/chaincode_example02 at tarball build time.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 15:28:35 GMT):<br/>
ok. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 15:29:05 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 ^^^^^^^ Just wanted you to be aware of the action plan

sounds right
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 15:43:53 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu As Greg mentioned in FAB-2986, URLs  like "sandbox/vex-yul" are ugly... can you provide an example of what the 'final' URL would be?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 15:44:15 GMT):<br/>
Also - is it possible to clean up the file structure a bit in the archive?  The script / templates are a bit confusing if you ask me - but maybe best to improve on that in the future and go with what we have?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 15:44:24 GMT):<br/>
Also - have people tested on Windows?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 16:59:21 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 we have to cleanup this script and will comeup with optimized script as soon as possible..

@greg @bur Much agreed with you - fancy having a chat about this in a small working group?  I posted a proposal for a couple of meetings (geo friendly timezones) to see who might be interested in helping to structure, write, draw and review the docs.  It seems like there's agreement that Getting Started needs work, and looking at Key Concepts, that needs some work too.  Personally, I'd like to see Getting Started walk through what is happening better by it being broken into much clearer sections that describe what's happening by gradually introducing the concepts e.g. :(empty fabric), create identities, add orderer, add peer(s), install sample chaincode, instantiate sample chancode, run sample query, run sample transaction etc etc.  As we go through these steps, we could both pictorially represent and show the commands to do it, so that by the end of GS, you understood the basic concepts and had a working system.  If you wanted to learn more, then see fuller descriptions in Key Concepts.  To your point of writing apps, it would be good to look at high level TOC structure, and how we might flesh that out too. Happy to chat here to initiate out some ideas, and then maybe have a community wide call for anyone else who'd like to help.  Make sense? 
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:21:50 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins gotcha wrong above
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:24:01 GMT):<br/>
@odowdaibm sounds great, thank you
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:24:18 GMT):<br/>
that is one of the things I am hoping the alpha2-challenge produces
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:24:54 GMT):<br/>
the other would be an understanding of what software design changes we need to optimize the experience

@odowdaibm this is precisely the purpose of the bdd subsytem's boostrap feature https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/bddtests/features/bootstrap.feature
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 23:15:31 GMT):<br/>
@odowdaibm there is work to be done to improve the Getting Started, no doubt
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 23:15:49 GMT):<br/>
However, the priority at this point is just making it correct for alpha2
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 23:16:03 GMT):<br/>
let's not let perfect get in the way of making progress, please
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 23:16:34 GMT):<br/>
I know the e2e has been somewhat updated, but we cannot have the front door be pointing to a past release
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 23:16:55 GMT):<br/>
we have not announced the release because we need the Getting Started to actually reference the alpha2 images and code.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 23:18:29 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 @greg.haskins same with the published binaries etc. at this point, an ugly URL is immaterial
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 23:18:29 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 @greg.haskins same with the published binaries etc. at this point, an ugly URL is immaterial and how they are produced is also at this point immaterial given the time constraint
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 23:18:36 GMT):<br/>
what we need are published binaries
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 23:18:51 GMT):<br/>
we can always fix things and move things around and assign vanity URLs

<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 00:23:56 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 my main concern is that trying to onboard new teams to hyperledger was really challenging when the URLs were either returning 404s or artifacts that didn't actually work properly.  I also don't want to have an environment where the artifact publication/documentation process allows bypassing governance controls like maintainer approval for a release.  I simply want to avoid repeating those mistakes if it can be helped because it can be damaging to the project if that is a users first exposure.  I can appreciate the sense of urgency here.  However, if there is agreement that these are the proper goals, we should strive to put the proper things in place sooner rather than later so we don't repeatedly find ourselves in this tough spot at each release point.  If, on the other hand, you all think I am overly concerned about unimportant issues, tell me to shut up ;)

@JonathanLevi We are still working on this.. script and tarballs are ready for each platform but we are unable to publish it to nexus repository.. Working with @jwagantall (from LF team).. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 04:05:09 GMT):<br/>
earlier it worked as expected but after recent permissions changes it stopped working.. It seems some configuration issue betwen maven, jenkins and nexus...

We really want (and need) to announce the availability of the *alpha2* widely, so that people can report issues. But I won't do it without a working *Getting Started* guide. That's really the basics.

this is regarding pom.xml but this is not helping much.. this file is basically building jar file and publishing the same.. but we need pom.t which deploy tar.gz files to nexus..

<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 04:13:12 GMT):<br/>

not sure what we have to add to that pom.xml to make it work.. and even not sure whether that is correct approach or not.. Trying to push tar files without using pom.xml from sandbox (testing) but getting un-authorized error.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 04:24:39 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 05:44:02 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu as mentioned earlier... the release needs to be deployed through the staging maven plugin.. which i showed earlier that works... that is what the credentials have permissions to do.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 05:44:57 GMT):<br/>
that's the reason why i created the root pom file.. 
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 05:45:35 GMT):<br/>
but i am not familiar with the fabric code to understand rick's complain on not needing the pom at all. 
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 05:46:12 GMT):<br/>
we can check if there is a way of using the staging deploy plugin to deploy files in particular.. but i have never used it that way
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 05:46:39 GMT):<br/>
basically the pom.xml what you have created is building artifact and publishing with `mvn deploy` (which is using staging plugin)
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 05:47:31 GMT):<br/>
but if we publish it only through pom.xml then it has to just publish tar files located in `release` folder
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 05:53:11 GMT):<br/>
could the problem be that we are moving everything to the release folder? and by the time the maven step runs it just doesnt find anything to unstall/deploy?
</p>
<p><strong>jwagantall</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 05:53:39 GMT):<br/>
again, we need the fabric devs to help out here with this step..

@greg.haskins, would it be possible to move the v1.0.0-alpha2 tag a few commits?
Reason: Yesterday the end-to-end.rst instructions added a comment for people in a dev environment to revert to v1.0.0-alpha2 if they want to run end to end trial:
git checkout v1.0.0-alpha2
However, at that tag level, both the end-to-end instructions and docker-compose for end-to-end were not working, so this will result in many problems.  The instructions and docker-compose were fixed just after the v1.0.0-alpha2 tag was put in place.  If the v1.0.0.0-alpha2 tag is moved to commit 5c353eb , then all is good with end-to-end. I don’t think we’d have to re-spin docker images, since there were no functional changes in that timeframe.  However, that would pick up your alpha3 update to Makefile. I’m not sure what the impact of that would be.  Here’s the commit history in question:

<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:08:39 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart, to you question: *would it be possible to move the v1.0.0-alpha2 tag a few commits?*
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:09:06 GMT):<br/>
Physically yes, easily. Not recommended at all !
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:11:49 GMT):<br/>
ok, as of now anybody following the instructions in dev env will have a broken e2e experience. Maybe we should just update the instructions to checkout 5c353eb instead of v1.0.0-alpha2.
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:12:44 GMT):<br/>
@bur @greg.haskins @cbf 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:13:26 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart  - for RTD "Getting started"  - which goes along with the alpha2 release - are the instructions correct?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:14:06 GMT):<br/>
yes, Getting Started is ok, we decided yesterday to put the latest instructions in the release tarball, rather than the alpha2 version of the instructions.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:14:16 GMT):<br/>
latest instructions are good
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:14:18 GMT):<br/>
 @bur @greg.haskins @cbf  thanks for comments.  I'm setting up conf details now - trying to get done in time for JST time zone.  Plenty of replies which suggest we should have a couple of good meetings tomorrow - thanks to everyone.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:15:21 GMT):<br/>
OK - then I'm not sure why we need to mess around with the tag?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:15:32 GMT):<br/>
Nick has a Getting Started ready to go for readthedocs, and it is good.  He'll pull the trigger once the tarball is on nexus.
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:16:05 GMT):<br/>
is that a GS that's basically the same as today, but all "fixed up" to reflect the tarball?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:16:23 GMT):<br/>
Only for people running the end-to-end in dev env.  the instructions for dev env say to revert (checkout) v1.0.0-alpha2.  If they revert to that level, the docs and docker-compose are bad.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:16:38 GMT):<br/>
The stuff in examples/e2e_cli in the repo should always work against the content of the repo
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:17:30 GMT):<br/>
In theory yes, but @cbf suggested we have people revert to alpha2 level of e2e_cli, just in case
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:17:47 GMT):<br/>
but that advise backfired, since the alpha2 level of instructions and docker compose are bad
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:18:02 GMT):<br/>
I'd like to see the GS structured to explain a little of the concepts as it progresses.  Are either of you able to attend the doc WG kickoff tomorrow - we had quite a good reply on the mailing list, and I had half a dzen private notes too
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:18:20 GMT):<br/>
BUT - the whole point of the alpha2 (or any release) images is that we DON'T want people doing stuff out of the repo
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:19:40 GMT):<br/>
correct, 'consumers' will use the docker images and tarball of e2e_cli.  It's only fabric 'developers' with a repo that will get hit by this.  So i guess we should remove that guidance for developers to revert to alpha2
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:19:49 GMT):<br/>
exactly
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:19:49 GMT):<br/>
exactly (to Gari's point)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:20:10 GMT):<br/>
@cbf, you suggested to add that guidance.  i'm suggesting to remove that guidance.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:20:35 GMT):<br/>
I agree - remove the guidance
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:20:42 GMT):<br/>
I think we need to take a step back
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:20:47 GMT):<br/>
what guidance?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:21:23 GMT):<br/>
yesterday you had Nick update end-to-end.rst, to advise readers (developers) to revert to alpha2 before they run e2e_cli
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:21:34 GMT):<br/>
holy cow
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:21:38 GMT):<br/>
but at alpha2 level, e2e_cli was broken
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:22:00 GMT):<br/>
I want whatever we publish as getting started/end to end to be based on alpha2
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:22:03 GMT):<br/>
directions were broken or the e2e was broken?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:22:12 GMT):<br/>
everything
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:22:24 GMT):<br/>
directions AND docker-compose were broken at alpha2 tag
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:22:28 GMT):<br/>
they were fixed right after that
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:22:55 GMT):<br/>
broken with regards to what, exactly
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:23:16 GMT):<br/>
for normal consumers it is ok, since the tarball on nexus uses latest e2e_cli instructions and docker-compose, rather than alpha2 level
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:24:05 GMT):<br/>
for example, at alpha2 tag level, Nick's updates for alpha2 were not yet merged, and therefore the instructions pointed to old shell script names
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:24:47 GMT):<br/>
to the docs?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:25:16 GMT):<br/>
end-to-end.rst was outdated as of alpha2 tag
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:25:35 GMT):<br/>
the updates got merged right after alpha2 tag
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:25:36 GMT):<br/>
(bangs head against desk)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:26:14 GMT):<br/>
the docker images are fine at alpha2 tag
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:26:30 GMT):<br/>
just this e2e content was bad
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:26:40 GMT):<br/>
for normal consumers it is ok, since the tarball on nexus uses latest e2e_cli instructions and docker-compose, rather than alpha2 level
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:29:22 GMT):<br/>
so, my suggestion, is for developers with a repo, to remove the guidance that they revert to alpha2 when doing e2e trial.  developers with a repo should always use latest.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:34:01 GMT):<br/>
what tarball?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:34:15 GMT):<br/>
I thought that we couldn't publish - and that was the whole issue
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:34:58 GMT):<br/>
right, currently it is a proposed tarball, that will end up on nexus.  as of this morning Ramesh is having issues pushing it.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:35:04 GMT):<br/>
if we need to cut an alpha2.1 we can, to make things whole
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:35:09 GMT):<br/>
hacking things is not the answer
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:35:48 GMT):<br/>
right now, e2e or getting started are all wrong - I blame me for being too duistracted to notice
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:35:48 GMT):<br/>
right now, e2e or getting started are all wrong - I blame me for being too distracted to notice
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:36:33 GMT):<br/>
BUT, it also highlights that not all the information was in JIRA
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:36:54 GMT):<br/>
since it was just the e2e example content and not code in docker images, we thought it would be ok to hack up the tarball. but you're right, we could make things whole by doing alpha2.1.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:36:54 GMT):<br/>
since it was just the e2e example content and not code in docker images, we thought it would be ok to hack up the tarball with latest e2e content. but you're right, we could make things whole by doing alpha2.1.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:39:35 GMT):<br/>
Getting Started is not yet pushed to readthedocs.  Nick has is prepared with the good instructions. He is ready to pull the trigger as soon as the nexus links become live.  So again, for normal consumers all will be good.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:42:01 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart @rameshthoomu  - we should remove `end-to-end.rst` from the tarball
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:42:10 GMT):<br/>
bingo
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:42:30 GMT):<br/>
People can use RTD with alpha2 and off they go
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:43:24 GMT):<br/>
agreed and correct
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:44:09 GMT):<br/>
its not just end-to-end.rst though, the docker-compose was also bad at alpha2 tag, and therefore those files in the tarball are hacked up to latest as well
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:44:28 GMT):<br/>
bad how
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:44:49 GMT):<br/>
and why wasn't someone saying something before we cut alpha2?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:46:40 GMT):<br/>
Shoot - this is worse than I thought in some ways - although not hard to recover from
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:47:22 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure why e2e was not working at alpha2 tag - I thought it was
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:47:35 GMT):<br/>
I don't care about the docs, but the e2e was working
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:47:56 GMT):<br/>
I'll take some of the blame as well
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:48:07 GMT):<br/>
the docker-compose was ok for leveldb, was broken for couch
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:48:14 GMT):<br/>
most people were testing leveldb
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:48:29 GMT):<br/>
I had a plan for how to produce the "release artifacts" as well
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:48:47 GMT):<br/>
ratnaker refactored the docker-compose, but nobody retested couch after that
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:50:07 GMT):<br/>
ok, now it is starting to make sense, because I had also tested e2e and it worked
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:50:17 GMT):<br/>
so clearly we need a TEST that TESTS both
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:50:34 GMT):<br/>
that said
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:51:23 GMT):<br/>
here is what I suggest
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:51:48 GMT):<br/>
and let me understand where we are --- have we published the alpha2 tarball, yes or now
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:51:48 GMT):<br/>
and let me understand where we are --- have we published the alpha2 tarball, yes or no
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:51:48 GMT):<br/>
and let me understand where we are --- have we published the alpha2 tarball, yes or no?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:52:00 GMT):<br/>
we have not
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:52:05 GMT):<br/>
no, tarball is ready but ramesh is having issues pushing it
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:52:11 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:52:36 GMT):<br/>
so, IMNSHO, we should NOT be asking anyone to build anything
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:53:21 GMT):<br/>
so fine, reverse my guidance on checking out alpha2 - but that was given because the docs currently say just do a git clone of master (which will be bad)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:53:43 GMT):<br/>
if we are REMOVING the git clone instructions, then obviously we don't need to checkout alpha2
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:53:47 GMT):<br/>
for normal consumers, we point them to Getting Started, which does not clone/make.  Getting Started docs will say to download the images.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:54:24 GMT):<br/>
that is the ONLY audience that matters
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:54:27 GMT):<br/>
for developers, they can clone/make.  We just need to clarify the roles in the end-to-end.rst
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:54:33 GMT):<br/>
nevermind them
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:54:51 GMT):<br/>
should probably remove e2e_cli.rst 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:55:06 GMT):<br/>
seriously
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:55:10 GMT):<br/>
we do this all the time
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:55:35 GMT):<br/>
there should be one place that says how to use getting started
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:55:40 GMT):<br/>
only one
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 11:58:13 GMT):<br/>
We should remove `end-to-end.rst` from the release artifact
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:00:32 GMT):<br/>
OK - so what do we want to do here?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:04:30 GMT):<br/>
Ramesh can easily remove `end-to-end.rst` from tarball
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:11:50 GMT):<br/>
I would suggest refactor end-to-end.rst into three documents going forward.    1) Consumer Getting Started (how to download images and end-to-end artifacts)  2) Developer Getting Started (how to clone/make).    3) Executing the end-to-end example.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:12:01 GMT):<br/>
Both Getting Started docs would point to #3 as the last step
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:14:24 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart 2 should be completely independent of e2e
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:14:52 GMT):<br/>
and frankly, If they cannot figure out from Makefile... 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:15:03 GMT):<br/>
there should just be getting started
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:15:38 GMT):<br/>
agreed that #2 should be later in the docs.  but i do think we need an easy on-ramp for developers too.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:24:12 GMT):<br/>
CONTRIBUTING.rst could be improved, sure
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:24:29 GMT):<br/>
let's focus on 1) fixing tarball
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:24:43 GMT):<br/>
2) merging e2e content into getting started
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:24:52 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=2x3e43hymLgcCtJra) @dave.enyeart I would strongly discourage moving a tag...it's far better to reduce emphasis on the name of the release than to try to alter history...therefore, I would suggest we simply cut an alpha2.1
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:24:59 GMT):<br/>
3) multiple independent testers
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:25:28 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=3xz7ij3YLAvRQDnc2) @greg.haskins +2
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:25:46 GMT):<br/>
but it is also unclear that we need another release
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:26:11 GMT):<br/>
just get the correct content in the tarball that works against published images
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:26:14 GMT):<br/>
for alpha2
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:26:57 GMT):<br/>
what we may want to do is to tag a RTD "release"
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:28:02 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=xRkjDP5Mvv9Y2KH2T) @dave.enyeart I see no problem in creating an alpha2.x branch, cherry picking what you wanted to include
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:28:21 GMT):<br/>
then we could point to the branch rather than a sha
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:28:21 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins I think that is overkill
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:28:50 GMT):<br/>
@cbf ok...just offering what I think would be acceptable from an SCM perspective
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:28:55 GMT):<br/>
look, the release is what it is
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:28:59 GMT):<br/>
agreed, we'll just remove the guidance in end-to-end.rst about checking out alpha2
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:29:02 GMT):<br/>
it has bugs
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:29:04 GMT):<br/>
we know this
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:29:13 GMT):<br/>
and then refactor end-to-end.rst going forward
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:29:30 GMT):<br/>
what we DO want though is for there to be clear instructions on how to deploy it
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:29:48 GMT):<br/>
we can address with the 3 steps above
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:30:24 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu You probably haven't been following along... but the action for you is to remove `end-to-end.rst` from tarball, before publishing it to nexus
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 12:30:55 GMT):<br/>
we will focus consumers on the upcoming Getting Started updates in readthedocs
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 14:02:11 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart @cbf @bur @mastersingh24 I know you're all interested. I posted details of tomorrow's documentation meetings on the mailing list: https://lists.hyperledger.org/pipermail/hyperledger-fabric/2017-May/000992.html  Great if you can join, but either way we'll post minutes there after the calls. 
</p>

@dave.enyeart OK, that's totally fine - I'll look out for your post.  Thanks again.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=HH5Lf36sdwvk8sF85) @dave.enyeart Do you want me to implement this change?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 14:22:47 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu as discussed at 9:30, the tarball is already pushed to nexus sandbox/logs. So as to not delay further, we'll go with the tarball as-is for today.  Going forward we'll remove end-to-end.rst
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 14:23:13 GMT):<br/>
ok..

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 14:24:58 GMT):<br/>

Here’s the FINAL steps for alpha2 release:
1) CR 8939 - Issue with maven deploy plugin pushing to staging/deploy/release.  As a workaround, Ramesh has pushed the release tarball to nexus /sandbox/logs directory.  Not ideal, but good enough for today.  CHRIS will talk to Ry about the issue.
2) CR for changing test env image tag - RAMESH
3) FAB-4007/ CR 9525 bootstrap.sh script - CHRIS will make on update for ./download-dockerimages.sh -c x86_64-1.0.0-alpha2 -f x86_64-1.0.0-alpha2
4) Need to test CR 9525 on all environments
- Mac confirmed
- Linux - RAMESH
- Windows (DAVE ENYEART will ask ARNAUD @lehors  to test)
5) Getting Started doc for readthedocs (FAB-3925), point to new bootstrap.sh script - NICK will push a CR

@dave.enyeart it's the problem with `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` not with maven deploy plugin.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 14:53:40 GMT):<br/>
Problem I mean to say.. existing approach is not working with this plugin.. as a workaround, using maven-deploy plugin published tarball to nexus/logs..

2. https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-4008 @rameshthoomu 
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9529
Not needed for today.

3 (+4) . https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-4007

It is looking like we won't get Windows working today.  I think we could announce alpha2 without it.   The windows restriction could be mentioned in the announce, or explicitly in the Getting Started instructions.  What do people think?

Also, any changes we make to get windows working would also entail a bit of re-testing on other platforms to make sure they continue to work. Given that, +1 from me so at least other platforms aren't blocked by this

Update on alpha2 final steps... Final comments for Getting Started doc are being addressed:https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3925 / https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9537. Once Nick re-pushes it can be +2ed and merged. 
After that is merged, it will be pushed to readthedocs (I believe automatically), and then we can announce alpha2 and point to Getting Started. We can just mention the windows limitation in the announce, we should be able to fix that in the next couple days since it is just the example scripting on nexus, not code in docker images.

Ok folks, we are very close to being done with alpha2 release activities.  The final task is to merge the updated Getting Started instructions, which will update readthedocs. I’ve already +2ed, need another maintainer to +2 and merge:
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3925 https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9537/

Once that is done then @JonathanLevi  can announce alpha2 on the mailing list and point people to Getting Started docs.

Also there are some improvements that have been discussed that could be done in the coming days.  In an ideal world they would have been done before announce, but at this point they can be done after announce, as to not further delay the announce:
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2986 Parent Story for making release artifacts available (e2e, confixtxgen, cryptogen)
  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3123 Build script to package and publish releases to Nexus from CI (https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8939/) @rameshthoomu 
  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3122 Add e2e and release binaries to nexus /release location (instead of /logs/sandbox), and point download utilities there @rameshthoomu 
  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-4031 bootstrap.sh should reside at a versioned location instead of an unversioned location

Also there are some improvements that have been discussed that could be done in the coming days.  In an ideal world they would have been done before announce, but at this point they can be done after announce, as to not further delay the announce:
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2986 Parent Story for making release artifacts available (e2e, confixtxgen, cryptogen). Children subtasks include:
  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3123 Build script to package and publish releases to Nexus from CI (https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/8939/) @rameshthoomu 
  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3122 Add e2e and release binaries to nexus /release location (instead of /logs/sandbox), and point download utilities there @rameshthoomu

Ok folks, we are very close to being done with alpha2 release activities.  The final task is to merge the updated Getting Started instructions, which will update readthedocs. I’ve already +2ed, need another maintainer to +2 and merge:

I'll mess around with it later today - as I mentioned, I built a release package a few weeks back and it work beautifully on Windows.  I actually did it just for you @lehors (because I hate Vagrant)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 11:03:13 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 11:03:33 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 I started looking into it and it's a bit of mess
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 11:04:47 GMT):<br/>
generateArtifacts.sh calls make which is not part of that environment
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 11:05:34 GMT):<br/>
and boostrap.sh fails right off the bat because uname -s doesn't return what it expects
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 11:05:50 GMT):<br/>
$ uname -s
MINGW64_NT-6.1
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 11:06:39 GMT):<br/>
and for what it's worth, it returns something different on the same machine using cygwin:
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 11:07:01 GMT):<br/>
$ uname -s
CYGWIN_NT-6.1-WOW

</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 11:07:39 GMT):<br/>
so it's going to take a bit more care to get those scripts running in various environments

I put together a proposal to address people's feedback on the Getting Started section in the documentation.  Here's a link to it: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-n-iLEM1iXrTFdkRV82S0wweWM/view?usp=sharing

We might have time to go through on today's doc WG call (1B).   I will set up separate meetings so that we can discuss properly whether or not we cover at this meeting.

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 11:48:47 GMT):<br/>
As noted, unless you want to upload a quick patchset to fix some of these? Nothing in my review is life-saving, really ;-) I'm happy to merge as is. Please LMK.

@lehors: only on Windows?

well, that's the only platform I have, so yes :)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 12:14:53 GMT):<br/>
it's rather ironic that I find myself in that situation by the way because I started my career on unix and only started using windows in 2000
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 12:15:18 GMT):<br/>
OK, do you have any idea if it is easy/possible to fix in a matter of hours? (Others will soon wake up and join us, I hope)

</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 12:17:20 GMT):<br/>
this said, maybe the problem comes from generating the artifacts
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 12:17:32 GMT):<br/>
OK, here is a thought.

Binaries are uploaded, the Getting Started guide is updated.
We should report issues on Windows (also) here: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-4032 (and thank you @lehors and everyone helping last night)
</p>

<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 12:50:49 GMT):<br/>
If so, please let me/us know.

</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 12:51:51 GMT):<br/>
ok, I'm going to
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 12:52:30 GMT):<br/>
holy smoke
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 12:52:36 GMT):<br/>
I got the orderer started
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 12:53:12 GMT):<br/>
there is something funky going on with mounting the genesis block file
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 12:53:35 GMT):<br/>
I copied the file to another location, change the docker-compose file to point to that new file and it started
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 12:56:19 GMT):<br/>
it's now running the cli script...
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 12:58:26 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure that everything went well but I got to:
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 12:58:41 GMT):<br/>
←[34mcli                       |←[0m
←[34mcli                       |←[0m ===================== All GOOD, End-2-End execution completed =====================
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 13:00:18 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanLevi I confirmed Getting Started is live: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html
I copy/pasted the commands from there to my mac terminal to pull the release artifacts, ran e2e, and everything worked fine:
===================== All GOOD, End-2-End execution completed ===================== 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 13:00:39 GMT):<br/>
So I'd vote to announce alpha2 with the windows caveat
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 13:01:08 GMT):<br/>
that's still fine with me but we may be able to fix that windows problem sooner than I thought
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 13:13:34 GMT):<br/>
so I do have network_setup up going through now
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 13:14:00 GMT):<br/>
it's silly though, I have to copy the genesis block to a different file to make it work
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 13:14:18 GMT):<br/>
so, not a complete fix but a workaround
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 13:15:16 GMT):<br/>
I will document in JIRA (to make @JonathanLevi happy ;-) how far I've gone so far
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 13:15:32 GMT):<br/>
and will further investigate after
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 13:26:56 GMT):<br/>
(As an aside ?) one of the biggest conferences will take place in NYC this Monday with a competition starting tomorrow (Sat-Sun. People are anticipating over 150 developers, some of which, are [ hardcore! ;-)] Windows users. Would be good to have them "covered" if we can.

*Given the progress and the fact that we will certainly announce today*, I'm happy to wait another hours or two, in case indeed, it may be solved. It is only 6:15am in some places... ;-)

</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:04:47 GMT):<br/>
so, I have no idea why but apparently the problem has to with the *name* of the file orderer.genesis.block
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:05:50 GMT):<br/>
all I actually have to do is change the name (with mv) and everything works fine
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:06:30 GMT):<br/>
I thought this might have to do with some permission settings (Windows is a source of problems there)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:06:45 GMT):<br/>
which I was eliminating by creating a copy
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:06:47 GMT):<br/>
but no
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:06:56 GMT):<br/>
just renaming the file fixes the problem...
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:08:40 GMT):<br/>
so what do you guys think? I can certainly patch the code to rename the file and workaround the problem which will make things better for those on Windows, right now
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:08:56 GMT):<br/>
as in: they should be able to get through the getting started doc
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:09:23 GMT):<br/>
but anyone who's going to try and setup their own network may run into the same problem
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:09:36 GMT):<br/>
so we'll need to document 
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:10:53 GMT):<br/>
So either changing the file (pushing a fix to the master branch)...
Or a note suggesting that Windows users will need to rename a file?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:12:02 GMT):<br/>
no, no, the question is: do we want to have such a weird workaround into the code?

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:12:47 GMT):<br/>
there is no reason this should impact any other platform

on other platforms the change is unnecessary but should be harmless

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:15:02 GMT):<br/>
Thank you @lehors, I'd go for fixing (but let's take a look at the code first), and ask others to try it as well.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:15:05 GMT):<br/>
(on Windows)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:15:44 GMT):<br/>
yup! it doesn't matter where the file is, it's the name
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:16:11 GMT):<br/>
so we just need to use something different from orderer.genesis.block
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:17:00 GMT):<br/>
let me see if I can change it at the time we generate it
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:17:06 GMT):<br/>
that'd be less ugly

</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:24:08 GMT):<br/>
if I change generateArtifacts to create the genesis block as genesis.block instead of orderer.genesis.block it works...

@nickgaski yes, it is crazy

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 15:16:45 GMT):<br/>
it's not the two periods because calling the file orderer.genesis.block2 works!?

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 15:56:51 GMT):<br/>
we could entertain the switch to nexus /release, but i thought that was riskier and would require more cross-platform test, since the folder structure changed a bit 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 15:57:26 GMT):<br/>
we're not going to be putting tarballs on the logs server again
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 15:57:41 GMT):<br/>
did cherry pick on @lehors patch and testing tarballs on windows7
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 15:57:50 GMT):<br/>
will let you know the update. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 15:58:57 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu how much cross-platform test has been done on the nexus /release tarball folder structure?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 15:59:16 GMT):<br/>
tested on linux and mac.. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 16:00:56 GMT):<br/>
in CR 9567 (or a CR immediately after) we could change bootstrap.sh from nexus /logs/sandbox to nexus /release

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 16:01:05 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 16:11:03 GMT):<br/>
I suggest Ramesh update both nexus /logs/sandbox and /release
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 16:11:11 GMT):<br/>
before to that we have to test on platforms with this new patch.. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 16:12:47 GMT):<br/>
by default bootstrap.sh will continue to use /logs/sandbox
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 16:13:17 GMT):<br/>
if there is confidence in /release, then bootstrap.sh could be updated in a new CR accordingly
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 16:14:11 GMT):<br/>
Unfortunately I will not have access this afternoon. @rameshthoomu could you coordinate testing on /release with @lehors help on windows
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 16:15:00 GMT):<br/>
yes @rjones mentioned this  [ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=ipDPDdi3eeozYvTz9) @rjones 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 16:15:39 GMT):<br/>
it is already on /logs/sandbox, and bootstrap.sh already points to it.  we are simply enhancing it there, while also testing on /release
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 16:16:47 GMT):<br/>
so better test tar balls on all platforms then push binaries to releases.. once testing is done will submit patch to change URL in bootstrap.sh
</p>

#!/bin/bash

export ARCH=$(uname -s|tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'|sed 's/mingw64_nt.*/windows/')-$(go env GOARCH)
echo "====> ${ARCH} "
echo
RELEASE_VERSION=1.0.0-alpha2
curl https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/releases/org/hyperledger/fabric/fabric-binary/${ARCH}-${RELEASE_VERSION}-testing/fabric-binary-${ARCH}-${RELEASE_VERSION}-testing.tar.gz | tar xz
cd release/${ARCH}
sh download-dockerimages.sh -c $(uname -m)-${RELEASE_VERSION} -f $(uname -m)-${RELEASE_VERSION}
```
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 18:07:14 GMT):<br/>
so, the test I did from scratch has now passed
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 18:08:06 GMT):<br/>
but I did get once again an error that seems to happen every now and then (seems fairly rare though)

Yes, I suspect so as well. Does look/seem, at first glance, as something more fundamental [ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=Z7sD7oHixAk8FBDCP)

<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 18:56:05 GMT):<br/>
BTW: @lehors, thank you vm for all your help and pushing forward (trying to address and fix, rather than release and apologize)...
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 18:58:03 GMT):<br/>
I have to say openly that it felt weird (yesterday) to think that we'd give up after @mastersingh24 confirmed that it worked just over a week ago. I'm sure this is not the last issue we'll encounter, yet still... it's much better to try and "fight it".

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 19:54:48 GMT):<br/>
@lehors we have tested on @harrijk's windows 7 machine and it worked as expected.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 19:55:44 GMT):<br/>
mount is not working on windows 7 machine hence tests are failing.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 19:55:44 GMT):<br/>
mount is not working on my windows 7 machine hence tests are failing.. 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:00:59 GMT):<br/>
gee... it's failing on my other windows box
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:01:07 GMT):<br/>
:(
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:01:12 GMT):<br/>
the bootstrap script!
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:01:16 GMT):<br/>
hold on
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:01:19 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:01:57 GMT):<br/>
ARCH=windows-386
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:02:10 GMT):<br/>
so it fails to get the tar ball
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:03:28 GMT):<br/>
yes, it's go env GOARCH returns 386 instead of amd64
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:06:19 GMT):<br/>
this is what I meant when I said earlier in the FAB "It is very possible that further tweaking is necessary on different Windows setups."
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:06:37 GMT):<br/>
there are so many possible variations
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:08:34 GMT):<br/>
is that because I have a 32bit go installed on that machine? I think so...
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:09:27 GMT):<br/>
it's a small laptop so I've been installing 32bit versions to try and use less memory
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:09:38 GMT):<br/>
should it matter though?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:12:33 GMT):<br/>
ok what are the next steps? Shall I publish latest binaries to releases  URL and submit patches to update bootstrap.sh and getting-started.rst ?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:12:55 GMT):<br/>
I think you should anyway
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:13:03 GMT):<br/>
this is still better than if you don't
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:13:13 GMT):<br/>
but it's clearly not the end of that story
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:17:00 GMT):<br/>
yes agree with you but at least it worked on 2 machines out of 3
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:17:14 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:17:30 GMT):<br/>
which is why I said it's still better
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:18:44 GMT):<br/>
one question I have to the maintainers (@cbf, @JonathanLevi) is that something we can change again as we improve on it or do we have to stick with what we have until the next release?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:22:29 GMT):<br/>
I have tested and verified latest tarballs [ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=2r6bggnAdP25HwcD9) @rameshthoomu  on `darwin`, `linux-amd64`, `windows (tested on 4 machines but worked on 2)` and `linux-s390x`..

</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:24:04 GMT):<br/>
why are we relying on go env GOARCH?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:51:38 GMT):<br/>
and why is fabric-couchdb installed as part of getting started when it's only an option?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:51:55 GMT):<br/>
on a small machine every bit counts...
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:52:37 GMT):<br/>
admittedly small machines aren't our primary target but it doesn't hurt to keep it easy to run on those machines too
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:53:33 GMT):<br/>
waiting for that image to download when I have no plan to use it isn't very nice
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 20:54:49 GMT):<br/>
ok, I'll stop whining for now :)
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:14:51 GMT):<br/>
arnaud sir, you're not the first to pose the couch question.  It's a cool feature but I'm going to remove it from getting started and link to it elsewhere
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:15:18 GMT):<br/>
those containers gobble up quite a bit of compute (especially since every peer has one)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:17:26 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu good news: I passed the test on my second machine
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:17:46 GMT):<br/>
but so, I really want to know why we use this 'go env GOARCH'
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:19:13 GMT):<br/>
I don't have the answer on that one.  perhaps ramesh or ratnakar 
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:19:16 GMT):<br/>
or chris 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:20:00 GMT):<br/>
and by the way, this assumes go is installed to go through getting-started
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:20:22 GMT):<br/>
do we have anything else in there that actually requires go for this first steps?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:21:07 GMT):<br/>
I understand that someone would probably want to install go eventually anyway but maybe in the spirit of making it easier for someone to get started we could avoid that dependency?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:21:45 GMT):<br/>
getting started is all about docker images and scripts
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:22:08 GMT):<br/>
it seems silly to require go just to go env GOARCH which evidently falls on its face anyway
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:22:28 GMT):<br/>
I will document my finding on the JIRA...
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:29:31 GMT):<br/>
ok that's good news.. @lehors 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:30:06 GMT):<br/>
Will wait for @cbf @JonathanLevi inputs on this [ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=5SzBzPcjwJA8w33wG) @lehors 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:30:32 GMT):<br/>
yep
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:30:53 GMT):<br/>
do you know why go env GOARCH is used?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:31:28 GMT):<br/>
it predated my involvement
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:31:49 GMT):<br/>
we could use something else I suppose
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:31:59 GMT):<br/>
like uname? :)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:32:06 GMT):<br/>
which is already used anyway!
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:32:26 GMT):<br/>
may be to match with this https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/Makefile#L284 line
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:33:09 GMT):<br/>
I see, so now we can blame @greg.haskins ? ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:33:48 GMT):<br/>
I suspect that it has to do with the way the go was compiled for the given platform
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:33:52 GMT):<br/>
release target is @mastersingh24 's handiwork
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:34:05 GMT):<br/>
that guy is a loser
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:34:09 GMT):<br/>
oh, even better! :)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:34:10 GMT):<br/>
lol
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:34:32 GMT):<br/>
but I understand why its there
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:34:41 GMT):<br/>
he allows you to build cross-compiled binaries
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:39:54 GMT):<br/>
in this case we're not even consistent
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:40:12 GMT):<br/>
because generateArtifacts uses uname -m
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:40:23 GMT):<br/>
so we might as well use that in both places
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:42:54 GMT):<br/>
so generateArtifacts uses this command to determine the ARCH
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:43:40 GMT):<br/>
echo "$(uname -s|tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'|sed 's/mingw64_nt.*/windows/')-$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/g')" | awk '{print tolower($0)}'
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:44:02 GMT):<br/>
why don't we use the exact same command in bootstrap.sh?? @rameshthoomu 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:44:58 GMT):<br/>
can one of you guys on mac or linux tell me if it returns something different from what is done now:
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:45:21 GMT):<br/>
echo "$(uname -s|tr [:upper:] [:lower:]|sed s/mingw64_nt.*/windows/)-$(go env GOARCH)"
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:45:49 GMT):<br/>
the latter doesn't work for my case
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:46:01 GMT):<br/>
the former works on both of my windows boxes
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:49:58 GMT):<br/>
Checking on Linux-amd64
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:53:14 GMT):<br/>
so?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:53:33 GMT):<br/>
linux-amd64.. worked.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:53:39 GMT):<br/>
testing on mac
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:53:49 GMT):<br/>
thanks
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:59:10 GMT):<br/>
on mac darwin-amd64
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 21:59:50 GMT):<br/>
but you could just run that one command and if it returns the same, we're good
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 22:00:24 GMT):<br/>
which command ?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 22:00:36 GMT):<br/>
the echo command
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 22:00:49 GMT):<br/>
I have executed this `echo "$(uname -s|tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'|sed 's/mingw64_nt.*/windows/')-$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/g')" | awk '{print tolower($0)}' `
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 22:00:57 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 22:02:53 GMT):<br/>
and by the way, evidently this uses two different ways of changing a string to lowercase :)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 22:03:22 GMT):<br/>
I don't know who's to blame for this but we can ignore it for now
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 22:15:00 GMT):<br/>
if it were up to me I would use the power of bash to make all those substitutions rather than sed, awk, tr, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 22:15:37 GMT):<br/>
it takes a few more lines of code but it's all run by bash directly without spawning off a bunch of execs
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 22:16:20 GMT):<br/>
in view of everything else it's not an optimization that matters but it's a style issue :)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 22:26:13 GMT):<br/>
ok, I couldn't resist. I used to love write bash scripts...:
S=`uname -s`;S=${S,,};S=${S/mingw64_nt*/windows}
M=`uname -m`;M=${M,,};M=${M/x86_64/amd64}
echo $S-$M
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 18:08:37 GMT):<br/>
There is nothing wrong with bootstrap.sh (well, theré is but that's irrelevant here) 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 18:09:37 GMT):<br/>
The problem is that the tarballs have not been uploaded at the right place
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 18:10:48 GMT):<br/>
Who can do it other than @rameshthoomu who's not around?

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 18:16:20 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 18:19:57 GMT):<br/>
ok well let's fix one of these issues.  either we fix the bootstrap script with my CR or we leave bootstrap and get Ramesh's patch merged.  Right now it doesn't work.  FWIW my CR fixes it
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 18:22:58 GMT):<br/>
I think your cr is the wrong fix, sorry
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 18:24:05 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu needs to finish the release by posting the tarballs at the right URLs

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 19:17:07 GMT):<br/>
Nick you can remove -testing from the link
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 19:39:48 GMT):<br/>
can we take a look at 9619 and +2 again
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 19:43:21 GMT):<br/>
@lehors - can you test on windows please.  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9619/
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 19:45:24 GMT):<br/>
Tested in Linux-amd64 and it's working
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 19:47:31 GMT):<br/>
sorry guys, boy now in bed, let me try
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 19:48:20 GMT):<br/>
I grabbed your patch and tested on top of it Arnaud
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 19:48:24 GMT):<br/>
looks good
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 19:48:38 GMT):<br/>
thanks
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 19:50:48 GMT):<br/>
has the getting-started doc been updated now? @rameshthoomu 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 19:51:30 GMT):<br/>
it doesn't look like it
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 19:52:33 GMT):<br/>
it doesn't need to change
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 19:52:36 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski What is the final patch..could you pls share here..
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 19:52:49 GMT):<br/>
the bootstrap.sh patch should solve our problem
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 19:53:00 GMT):<br/>
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9619
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 19:53:09 GMT):<br/>
Ok
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 19:53:58 GMT):<br/>
LGTM
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 19:54:21 GMT):<br/>
If you submit another remove docker images command
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 19:54:30 GMT):<br/>
Another patch
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 19:55:15 GMT):<br/>
oh you mean don't list the images out
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 19:56:29 GMT):<br/>
Yes I am doing that from download docker images script
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 19:59:11 GMT):<br/>
LGTM now
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:00:11 GMT):<br/>
ok, I'm confused
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:00:37 GMT):<br/>
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/fabric/master/examples/e2e_cli/bootstrap.sh | bash doesn't work for me
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:01:04 GMT):<br/>
it wants to fetch https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/logs/sandbox/fabric-binary/windows-amd64-1.0.0-alpha2.tar.gz which doesn't exist
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:01:54 GMT):<br/>
Yes.. doc is still referring sandbox
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:02:12 GMT):<br/>
ok, so the doc does need fixing
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:02:15 GMT):<br/>
that's what I thought
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:03:00 GMT):<br/>
Once 9619 is merged it automatically pull from releases url
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:03:11 GMT):<br/>
No fix needed in doc
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:03:45 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:04:21 GMT):<br/>
do we have 2 maintainers to get the merge in?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:07:56 GMT):<br/>
sorry, I don't know what you want me to test right now
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:08:58 GMT):<br/>
as a side note, we'll need to improve on those scripts so when something goes wrong people get more helpful error messages
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:09:12 GMT):<br/>
but we can look into that next, once that fire is out
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:09:41 GMT):<br/>
Yes will optimize later.
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:09:58 GMT):<br/>
the doc DOES NOT need fixing.  the bootstrap.sh needs fixing :)
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:10:14 GMT):<br/>
😉
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:10:18 GMT):<br/>
let me go get jonathan and gari 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:10:49 GMT):<br/>
Inform Chris also
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:13:52 GMT):<br/>
ok, I'm around and ready to test as soon as the patch is merged
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:14:59 GMT):<br/>
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9619/ is merged.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:15:29 GMT):<br/>
Thanks everyone ( even @mastersingh24 included ) !
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:23:07 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @JonathanLevi 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:31:34 GMT):<br/>
ok, it worked on one of my windows box
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:31:34 GMT):<br/>
ok, it worked on one of my windows boxes
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:33:48 GMT):<br/>
hmm, it's failing on the second one for some reason
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:34:02 GMT):<br/>
it's independent of the scripts though
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:34:08 GMT):<br/>
my env may not be clean
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:35:48 GMT):<br/>
yeah, it's running now
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:35:56 GMT):<br/>
I had some containers still running
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:37:04 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski you were right: the doc DID NOT fixing ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:37:04 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski you were right: the doc DID NOT need fixing ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:37:20 GMT):<br/>
ok, test on second box passed
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:37:27 GMT):<br/>
so 2/2 for me!
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:40:09 GMT):<br/>
we still have some crap in the tarballs that is going to confuse people
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:40:48 GMT):<br/>
there is an older version of bootstrap.sh and install/get-docker-images.sh
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:41:07 GMT):<br/>
I don't even think those files should be in there at all
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:41:26 GMT):<br/>
but at least now if people follow the doc it should work
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:44:01 GMT):<br/>
Yes tar ball is pushed before patch merge.. so for now will leave as is.. 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:46:33 GMT):<br/>
I think that's ok
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:46:46 GMT):<br/>
now that the main fire is out we can start working on polishing things
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:48:45 GMT):<br/>
Yes.. thanks @lehors @nickgaski Have a good weekend 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 20 May 2017 20:48:55 GMT):<br/>

@rameshthoomu why do we use x64_64 in the name of the docker images but windows-amd64 in the name of the tarball?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 25 May 2017 13:16:23 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 25 May 2017 13:22:14 GMT):<br/>
We use ARCH (uname -m) while building docker images but in make release-all we are using 
```
release/%-amd64: DOCKER_ARCH=x86_64
release/%-amd64: GOARCH=amd64
```

I have to admit not to understand if there is a meaningful difference between the two names but for our purpose it would seem better to settle on name or the other and use it throughout

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 25 May 2017 14:06:37 GMT):<br/>

yes, that'd be my preference
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 25 May 2017 14:07:20 GMT):<br/>
because it also means we don't depend on Go for that
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 25 May 2017 14:09:20 GMT):<br/>
exactly
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 25 May 2017 14:09:30 GMT):<br/>
I understand @mastersingh24 uses go env GOARCH in Makefile to support cross-platform compilation, which may be fine there but other than that we should stick to using uname
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 25 May 2017 14:09:54 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu can you create a Jira item to make that change?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 25 May 2017 14:10:42 GMT):<br/>
I can do that
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 25 May 2017 14:19:27 GMT):<br/>
Please do not change the Makefile

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 08:51:10 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 08:52:12 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 27 May 2017 13:06:23 GMT):<br/>
@rickr - not sure what "not make v1" would actually mean  ;)   I think it comes down to being able to put out a v1.0.0 version when it's ready to go.  It could be the same exact time as the fabric runtime or it could be slightly after.  I think it all comes down to feeling it is solid and ready to go
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Sat, 27 May 2017 13:14:42 GMT):<br/>
Well fine. I guess it depends on your perspective. Being on the SDK end and having  people pointing to it as the source of their problems when it actually the Fabric and from it's logs error messages maks it almost impossible except for someone that knows logic intimately (the developer that wrote the code) to figure out what is wrong  I guess I have my concerns about it too then.

we have been debating whether Java CC will be included. Right now it is disabled. There is discussion as to whether or not to make it optionally enabled, which I tend to think would be a mistake as it would only invite people to try it and then have issues or questions

Is there a reason to use a mix of amd64 and x86_64? or is it merely accidental because we use a mix of goenv GOARCH and uname -ml?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 29 May 2017 15:01:07 GMT):<br/>
@lehors - yeah - sorry - was on the road and frustrated about a few things that had been happening
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 29 May 2017 15:01:40 GMT):<br/>
it's really accidental in the sense that cross compiling uses amd64 due to GOARCH
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 29 May 2017 15:02:08 GMT):<br/>
I really wish Docker supported repo's based on arch
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 29 May 2017 15:09:03 GMT):<br/>
did you see that there is an extra twist with go env GOARCH in that on Windows it returns different values depending on whether you have a 32bit or 64bit install
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 29 May 2017 15:09:08 GMT):<br/>
on the same machine
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 29 May 2017 15:10:47 GMT):<br/>
so the question is can we settle on a single name?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 29 May 2017 15:11:07 GMT):<br/>
and which one
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 29 May 2017 15:12:12 GMT):<br/>
we'll have to work around the differences one way or another to use the same across the board
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 29 May 2017 15:44:36 GMT):<br/>
I will go ahead and create a JIRA ticket for this, and we can discuss there the best route

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 29 May 2017 22:00:50 GMT):<br/>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=mJFj6bsH6oMx4Ns5M) @mastersingh24 This is something I've been wondering for a while. What percentage of Fabric users (or users of blockchain tech in general) can we expect will be using 32 bit Windows systems? I mean, I can understand that big banks will not be using an operating system that old, but one of the most common use cases we talk about is supply chains, which potentially involves many dozens of computers in warehouses and ports around the world. 

Do we have a sense of how many of those computers are 32 bit Windows systems?

I mean, I can understand that big banks will not be on tech that old, but one of the most common use cases we talk about is supply chains, which potentially involves many dozens of computers in warehouses and ports around the world. 

Do we have a sense of how many of *those* computers are 32 bit Windows systems?

Do we have a sense of how many of *those* computers are 32 bit Windows systems? 

I mean, Microsoft does keep releasing every new operating system in a 32 bit format for a reason -- they have 10s of millions users with old systems that can't support a 64 bit OS. And while I understand that a lot of those people aren't likely to be joining a blockchain network any time soon, it is something I've wondered about, especially in the supply chain use case I mentioned.

Guess I should have been more clear - both Docker Toolbox and Docker for Windows only support 64bit platforms

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=qTFwJ5rzfcE2xq3X2) @joe-alewine Joe, I started tracking downloads of the Getting Started bundle here https://goo.gl/#analytics/goo.gl/NIKLiU/all_time as you can see, Windows seems to be the predominant platform, at least for the download... that of course does not necessarily mean that is where they're deploying (I suspect many are using a cloud hosting provider)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 13:11:29 GMT):<br/>
As @mastersingh24 mentioned, there is no reason to support Win 32 because it isn't supported by Docker for Windows 
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 13:32:02 GMT):<br/>
@cbf Thanks. Very interesting. Glad to see this is being tracked. I'm a bit surprised that there are twice as many referrers from facebook as from google, but the vast majority of the referrers are unknown (slack or rocket? Or maybe from email?) so I'm not really sure what to make of it either way. @mastersingh24 is right about Docker for Windows, of course. Hadn't thought about that

@JonathanLevi @bmos299 I think we'll want somebody from test lab to tackle FAB-4275 and FAB-4280 (test of release artifacts). I'm happy to help, but unfortunately I will be out June8-June19 and therefore want to ensure a 'test lead' is in place before I go.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 13:34:04 GMT):<br/>
I added more detailed comments in the two FABs
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 13:35:54 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 13:36:28 GMT):<br/>
You assigned one of them to me :) I just changed them to Barry

@JonathanLevi do you have a view on whether or not the APIs will be locked down after the proposed release next week?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 20:15:53 GMT):<br/>
I have a view [and quite a strong opinion ;-)] but it may not be only up to me.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 20:17:17 GMT):<br/>
There are some issues that we became aware of that may break some of the API - but we are aware of them.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 20:17:36 GMT):<br/>
More directly, how can I help? ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 20:18:11 GMT):<br/>
every time you change the APIs a composer dev cries ;)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 20:18:49 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 20:18:59 GMT):<br/>
i'm trying to figure out if we should try and deliver alpha 2 support next week or just hold back for alpha 3/beta and go straight to that
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 20:19:31 GMT):<br/>
Using the SDK ?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 20:19:40 GMT):<br/>
Using Channels ?
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 20:19:51 GMT):<br/>
yeah, using the node SDK and channels
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 20:31:18 GMT):<br/>
Sounds like you should build stuff on the latest (even `master` right now).
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 20:31:40 GMT):<br/>
But if you can resist working during the entire weekend, then I/we would probably have a clearer view early next week.
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 21:39:39 GMT):<br/>
we can only build on what you publish to docker hub and more importantly npm ;)
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 21:39:51 GMT):<br/>
early next week is fine with me

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=qJ3WnuoFHY8iHWW52) @sstone1 They were SUPPOSED to be locked down at alpha2 
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 23:28:32 GMT):<br/>
^^^ Indeed !
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 23:29:44 GMT):<br/>
They were SUPPOSED to be locked down at alpha2... we really wanted (intended, at least) to release a *v1.0.0-beta* earlier in the week (before June 1st).
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 23:30:56 GMT):<br/>
At any rate, some API changes have been made (we have an approval/voting process) and the API has changed. Yes, please let's catch up early next week. Just being upfront.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 23:31:47 GMT):<br/>
I believe it's really just a matter of a few days (and some of the upcoming issues, seem pretty important too).

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:40:27 GMT):<br/>
@cbf - The final step to publish to Maven is not fully automatic as you know.  So we need to include creating the detached signature for the jar artifact as a JIRA task
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 15:50:45 GMT):<br/>
@cbf commented in 4271. in short we are fully automated (and tested during alpha and alpha2 releases)

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 21:39:03 GMT):<br/>
@weeds We are trying to work out whether we can (finally) lock the API. Of course we should cut a *beta* as soon as we can.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 21:39:51 GMT):<br/>
The original plan was to lock the APIs right after the alpha. Let's see, if we can go straight to a *beta*, then let's do it. 
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 21:40:18 GMT):<br/>
Otherwise/either way, I would still prefer to release/cut a version in the coming days. However we call it.

Is there  any plan to publish what API changes in alpha3 or beta?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 14:41:50 GMT):<br/>
Good morning. @weeds, see some context above https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=knGQSEcCrSpmBXPCL
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 14:42:54 GMT):<br/>
But at the moment, I actually don't know what is going to change API-wise... we have already merged the SDK changes and the tests/examples are updated.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 14:44:58 GMT):<br/>
So other than https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10039 (which @kostas) is updating regularly as it progresses... if are good with locking down the API, then we can really call even this week's release a *beta*.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=86fgbszCTJYKgEDaW) I may be repeating this, but I don't mind how we call it. I'd rather push forward towards a beta, if people feel that we are there (rather than holding them back).
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 14:47:01 GMT):<br/>
The only/main thing I'd expect is that whatever we agree on ("shake on") we respect going forward. That is, really only *show stoppers* will get in, beyond that point, etc.

So, we (= @cbf, mostly) have introduced an automated changeset that provides all the changes that are included in a given release. These include not only API changes, but also functionality and logic changes.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 14:51:05 GMT):<br/>
We have also been trying to ask committers to provide details descriptions regarding the CR/changes also in the JIRA tickets. So hopefully, this time round, should have these right at the JIRA level as well.

</p>
<p><strong>simsc</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 17:30:55 GMT):<br/>
Here's what I captured from wipeboard build / publish discussion.   I wanted to make sure we agree on what's captured first,  then we have to get this documented in Jira, a run book, etc.

Proposed:
0) Submit CR

1) When release = true
    - do full tests including 'gulp test'
    - fabric unit, e2ecli, bdd, full gulp, e2e java
    
2) Assuming test pass
    - TAG it (Ramesh to talk to greg to see if this can be automated)
    - create docker images
     -make release binaries  (configtxgen, configgen)
     -publish to docker hub, npm, maven, nexus
     -update getting started started doc

3) Verify release binaries
    - QA uses docker images and uploaded release binaries to test on Mac, Linux, and Windows

We will do manually this week.  We need to have this in place for next week release of Beta.

While I'm not going to take sides here... I see two "competing" forces:
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 19:37:19 GMT):<br/>
Given a deadline (say we fix a date):

1. A "release" with high quality super tested stuff, and only that gets "in".
2. A "release" that is packed with all sorts of features. Some heavily tested, other super brand new.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 19:38:11 GMT):<br/>
Many (open-source) projects, choose to work with 2 separate targets/releases (like an LTS and a more "dev"-y like).
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 19:38:27 GMT):<br/>
Thinks about Ubuntu 16.04 vs 16.10... for example.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 19:39:11 GMT):<br/>
I get a feeling that most of the "arguments" / "debates" stem from us not clearly defining what we want or expect.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 19:39:39 GMT):<br/>
I feel that many actions are based on "we really need to have that feature, without it the sky will fall"
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 19:39:39 GMT):<br/>
I feel that many actions are based on "we really need to have that feature, without *feature XYZ* the sky will fall"
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 19:40:25 GMT):<br/>
And many others, take actions based on "look, I don't want to add this, if it not tested enough, without *testing* this the sky will fall"

Maybe it will help to remind us all, that Fabric 1.0 is not going to be the *last* release.
We will 1) add more *features like XYZ*
We will 2) find more bugs/faults even with having 2-3 weeks of *testing*

Just for perspective - this is Apple's first Control Panel, for those of us too young to have played with it.

my comment in 10247 was about configtxlator. i didnt think it was packaged into release artifacts yet, and therefore not pushed into nexus tar. This was one of the objectives of the blocking item FAB-4267. @rameshthoomu @jyellick , is there a plan for how beta consumers can exercise configtxlator?

</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 13:38:52 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart The extent of the initial pass of `configtxlator` CRs was to add it to the `RELEASE_PKGS` in the `Makefile`.  I'm not an expert on what happens from here, I presumed that the things in `RELEASE_PKGS` were what ended up put into the release package.  With respect to FAB-4267, I would agree, the homebrew file should be updated.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 13:39:58 GMT):<br/>
Ok, we'll see if @rameshthoomu has scooped it up into the release artifacts that are pushed to nexus
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 13:42:36 GMT):<br/>
the release artificats I have pushed to nexus on alpha2 commits.. So existing release artifacts doesn't have this change.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 13:43:00 GMT):<br/>
let me look into the change.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 13:44:00 GMT):<br/>
ok, so only configtxgen and cryptogen are included i think.  so the next question is, do we WANT configtxlator to be included and do we have instructions for how beta consumers would exercise it?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 13:47:54 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart Yes, of course we want it included. That's why Jason added it to the RELEASE_PKGS
</p>

yes..
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 13:56:04 GMT):<br/>
Sure will include this in tar file and publish to nexus
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 13:56:04 GMT):<br/>
Sure will include this in tar file and publish to nexus in next release
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 13:58:49 GMT):<br/>
ok, that would address first part of my question. second part of my question is @jyellick are there instructions for how beta consumers would exercise configtxlator? or is that something that needs to be worked on for next release milestone?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 14:00:55 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart There is a doc I put together.  It's at a fairly low level, because `configtxlator` is targeted at SDK users who wish to be able to manipulate the config, you may find it here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/examples/configtxupdate/README.md
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 14:01:33 GMT):<br/>
My hope is to improve this doc before release, add additional examples, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 14:01:51 GMT):<br/>
But I think there is enough there that someone eager could get started
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 14:02:24 GMT):<br/>
I would love for @nickgaski or others to help improve the documentation
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 14:05:57 GMT):<br/>
thanks jason.  let me have a read.  been looking forward to seeing this sucker in action 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 14:08:03 GMT):<br/>
agreed, an example in the doc would be great, in addition to this config and config update playback video we've discussed.
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 14:09:00 GMT):<br/>
For the moment, I'm prioritizing defect resolution over the playback, but it is on my list
</p>
<p><strong>nickgaski</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 14:09:16 GMT):<br/>
ah damn I was going to ask for a quick demo
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 14:09:45 GMT):<br/>
ok, let's get off the release channel now :)  i'm sure there is more critical release business...
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 14:36:10 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart thanks for the thoroughness
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 14:36:51 GMT):<br/>
not sure we need to worry about configtxlator docs but do want it in the release pkg
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 14:41:21 GMT):<br/>
after more discussion with @rameshthoomu , he did a pre-release trial yesterday, see June 06 tar file: https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/hyperledger/fabric/fabric-binary/darwin-amd64-1.0.0-alpha3-SNAPSHOT/
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 14:41:31 GMT):<br/>
and configtxlator is indeed in the /bin directory :)

while you cannot download the release tarballs yet, testing the e2e here https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10261/ and following the directions in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10247/ would be especially helpful
</p>

kick the tires, follow the to-be-updated getting started and docs https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10247/ (do a local build) and run e2e (excepting the download part, you'd need to build images and binaries locally from https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10261/ ). Also would benefit from testing ot fabric-ca and sdks similarly

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 18:51:42 GMT):<br/>
I still don't know why end-to-end.rst reads as if I should be able to do that on Windows directly (via Docker Toolbox)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 18:59:21 GMT):<br/>
nor why we have end-to-end and getting-started - they are highly redundant
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 18:59:51 GMT):<br/>
I thought I had seen something about merging the two

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=7fnEvcucMcwmdAtTh) @smithbk Keith, I don't get the spelling errors
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:11:40 GMT):<br/>
I do

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:11:47 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:11:52 GMT):<br/>
I get a whole load of them

<p><strong>smithbk</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:12:07 GMT):<br/>
With "make release-all" you don't but with "make" you do
</p>
<p><strong>smithbk</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:12:17 GMT):<br/>
atleast I do

:-) yeh that too

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:13:29 GMT):<br/>
sorry, that was a bit much :)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:14:08 GMT):<br/>
these are trivial to fix but don't know that we should touch this stuff at this point
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:14:21 GMT):<br/>
otherwise let me know and I'll be happy to submit a CR :)
</p>
<p><strong>smithbk</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:14:34 GMT):<br/>
@lehors What did you do to get past the other error?
</p>
<p><strong>smithbk</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:14:36 GMT):<br/>
cat: release/linux-s390x/install/../../templates/get-docker-images.in: No such file or directory
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:14:52 GMT):<br/>
nothing
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:15:12 GMT):<br/>
I ignored them and in the end it seems not to have mattered
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:16:00 GMT):<br/>
I just made just I had the docker images with a make docker
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:16:00 GMT):<br/>
I just made sure I had the docker images with a make docker
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:16:04 GMT):<br/>
that part worked
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:16:31 GMT):<br/>
so, I'm not saying it is quite all right
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:18:52 GMT):<br/>
the spelling errors from CHANGELOG seem to indicate that it would serve well to have a spelling checker hooked onto git commit ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:19:07 GMT):<br/>
@smithbk oh nevermind, I see I changed a file doh!
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:19:47 GMT):<br/>
and @cbf the CHANGELOG starts with * [d9a81f03](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/commit/d9a81f03) [WIP] [FAB-4380](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-4380) prepare for 1.0.0-beta release
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:20:00 GMT):<br/>
I'm guessing you don't want WIP in there
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:27:12 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:27:14 GMT):<br/>
updated CR

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:27:25 GMT):<br/>
good catch

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=SoBFiBQkwkCefhFCK) @lehors this is a good point, though the end-to-end.rst is more for ppl building from a clone while the GS is for someone downloading the images
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:47:08 GMT):<br/>
that's fine but it doesn't work natively on Windows
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:47:29 GMT):<br/>
I mean end-to-end
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:47:36 GMT):<br/>
so it should imply that it will
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:47:36 GMT):<br/>
so it should not imply that it will
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:47:52 GMT):<br/>
oh, sorry, missed that point
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:48:07 GMT):<br/>
does GS work on Windows?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:48:37 GMT):<br/>
well, I can't test the latest one but I expect it will
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:48:50 GMT):<br/>
I made sure it did for alpha2
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:48:59 GMT):<br/>
I think it will work for beta as well
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:49:26 GMT):<br/>
it's the build with make that doesn't work on Windows
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:49:35 GMT):<br/>
what part of end-to-end doesn't work on Windows?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:50:46 GMT):<br/>
make release-all
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:51:03 GMT):<br/>
which is what end-to-end tells you to do after cloning the repo
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:51:58 GMT):<br/>
what about that fails?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:52:03 GMT):<br/>
I'll try again, maybe I missed something
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:52:26 GMT):<br/>
oh well - I think that gari changed that to make release
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:52:48 GMT):<br/>
because when you are running local, you only need your os/arch
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:52:55 GMT):<br/>
let me double check
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:53:36 GMT):<br/>
the two targets exist actually
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:53:49 GMT):<br/>
but you're right, for e2e make release should do
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:55:49 GMT):<br/>
done
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:56:01 GMT):<br/>
good catch again
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:56:11 GMT):<br/>
of course, I don't do Windows
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 19:56:27 GMT):<br/>
oh I know :-)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:04:34 GMT):<br/>
BTW: @lehors, thanks for your round of checking of the LICENSEs

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:05:20 GMT):<br/>
yw
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:05:57 GMT):<br/>
@cbf will simply update
test/chaincodes/BadImport/main.go Greg Haskins (We'll assign it to @greg.haskins - who can re-assign it if needs be) 
core/config/config_test.go Anil (which we'll assign to IBM)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:05:57 GMT):<br/>
Just talked to @cbf who will simply update
*test/chaincodes/BadImport/main.go* Greg Haskins (We'll assign it to @greg.haskins - who can re-assign it if needs be) 
*core/config/config_test.go* Anil (which we'll assign to IBM)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:06:11 GMT):<br/>
As it is easier at this point to simply update the staged commit.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:06:28 GMT):<br/>
FYI
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:06:46 GMT):<br/>
yes, makes sense to me
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:07:45 GMT):<br/>
----
For the record, IBM and others seem less concerned with JSONs and binaries at this point. We can re-visit if needed. Thanks again @lehors and @tkuhrt 
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:08:06 GMT):<br/>
Please, all, reach out if the above presents any issue.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:08:06 GMT):<br/>
Please, all/everyone/anyone, reach out if the above presents any issue.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:08:28 GMT):<br/>
well, IBM might be but I don't think @tkuhrt feels the same :)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:09:07 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I understand, which is why I'm checking.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:10:06 GMT):<br/>
I'll let her speak for herself but she's made pretty clear that everything has to have a copyright and license (I assume binaries excluded)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:12:10 GMT):<br/>
there is probably a few exceptions besides binaries though, like CHANGELOG, MAINTAINERS
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:12:18 GMT):<br/>
maybe pem files?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:13:14 GMT):<br/>
I took Tracy's point as: everything except when there is a good reason not to
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:16:41 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I remember. I believe we may re-visit some of the above (certainly, on the to the GA). I just didn't want to miss/skip some of the data/info that your scripts provided relating to the Golang files, at this point.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:17:26 GMT):<br/>
-- Yours, the pragmatic Jon ;-)

:)

<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 20:40:10 GMT):<br/>
e2e_cli ran fine on my mac with these images
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:02:48 GMT):<br/>
well, I'm not sure what's up but I was able to do make release within docker toolbox on windows 7 but that's all
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:03:22 GMT):<br/>
and there is something weird with my make command which doesn't work, I have to use cygwin's but we can ignore that for now
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:03:35 GMT):<br/>
more importantly make docker fails
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:05:18 GMT):<br/>
unfortunately our Makefile has become so sophisticated it's getting hard to find out what's wrong when things go wrong.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:22:48 GMT):<br/>
ok, I think I found the root cause of the error and it seems to be (again) a Docker Toolbox problem
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:23:01 GMT):<br/>
grrr
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:25:38 GMT):<br/>
a problem with volume mounts (which seems to be an ongoing source of problems)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:29:49 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=2p3pW6YjkQ3naDnKi) @JonathanLevi TLDR, what is the action item you need from me?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:30:16 GMT):<br/>
oh, is this w.r.t. copyright assignments?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:30:23 GMT):<br/>
I took it as JIRA assignments
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:30:31 GMT):<br/>
if copyright, sounds good to me
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:31:27 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=hru9p3TQ9dHEZwsfQ) @lehors Ill take the blame for that mate:  what seems to be the problem?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:32:09 GMT):<br/>
(though in my defense, i think a bunch of things were piled on there that really should have been subdir/Makefiles
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:32:11 GMT):<br/>
i digress
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:32:29 GMT):<br/>
oh, I know, no worries :)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:32:37 GMT):<br/>
overall, I own the lion share of blame for any complexity there
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:32:43 GMT):<br/>
git blame makes that quite clear as a matter of fact ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:33:14 GMT):<br/>
on the copyright point, the question is what the copyright should be for a file you created
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:33:36 GMT):<br/>
recently
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:33:46 GMT):<br/>
just assign it to me: normally I assign it to whoever signs my paycheck, but our legal dept seems to be ignoring my question
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:33:49 GMT):<br/>
older files have a LSE copyright
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:34:18 GMT):<br/>
anything since 12/16, def not LSE
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:34:36 GMT):<br/>
gregory.haskins@gmail.com is fine
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:34:53 GMT):<br/>
if SS ever gets back to me, ill retro-assign it over
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:35:01 GMT):<br/>
ok, good to know
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:35:46 GMT):<br/>
test/chaincodes/BadImport/main.go is from March so I figured it couldn't be LSE
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:36:28 GMT):<br/>
yeah, just assign to me
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:36:35 GMT):<br/>
actually thats probably from last week IIRC
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:36:36 GMT):<br/>
but either way
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:37:02 GMT):<br/>
(im actually surprised I forgot to add one ...oh well
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:37:07 GMT):<br/>
fast-n-furious
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:38:32 GMT):<br/>
understood
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:39:06 GMT):<br/>
otherwise, about the Makefile, I was trying to figure out how the command to build peer-docker is figured out
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:39:26 GMT):<br/>
the docker run doesn't work for me
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:39:54 GMT):<br/>
and I have now figured that it's because the volume mount into the container doesn't work
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:40:10 GMT):<br/>
so the source files are not visible from within the container

@greg.haskins can you please tell me how DRUN is set?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:46:28 GMT):<br/>
look in docker-env.mk
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:46:39 GMT):<br/>
that file is included by the top-level Makefile
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:47:12 GMT):<br/>
got it
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:47:13 GMT):<br/>
thanks

(you arent the first to miss the indirection there)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:48:03 GMT):<br/>
I was looking for an include at the top.. silly me I should have search for it :)

<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:48:47 GMT):<br/>
that doesnt seem unreasonable...i think I put it at the point that I wanted it to become effective, but i am not sure make even works that way
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:49:24 GMT):<br/>
(e.g. I wanted the variables that are declared above it to be in effect when it was loaded, but maybe they would be anyway..i am not sure
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:49:46 GMT):<br/>
right, I figured that was why you put it there
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:49:55 GMT):<br/>
I don't know either whether this really matters
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:50:07 GMT):<br/>
well, for clarity at least
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:50:26 GMT):<br/>
a handful of others thought $(DRUN) was magic voodoo until I pointed out the include
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:50:54 GMT):<br/>
revealing the wizard behind the curtain
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:50:55 GMT):<br/>
heh
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:51:40 GMT):<br/>
right, it does seem magic when you can't find the include indeed
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:52:23 GMT):<br/>
well, did you see the output I got above?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:52:34 GMT):<br/>
I think there is something very wrong with Docker toolbox
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:52:56 GMT):<br/>
i didnt really understand what I was looking at
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:53:04 GMT):<br/>
the mount is simply not working
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:53:17 GMT):<br/>
but that said, we generally only support "real" docker, and docker-for-mac
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:53:21 GMT):<br/>
for other reasons
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:53:48 GMT):<br/>
oh, I just do a docker run which does a mount of the fabric src directory and execute ls 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:53:59 GMT):<br/>
and it shows the files are not visible
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:54:09 GMT):<br/>
not that others cannot work per se, but a) thats how it was tested and b) I know older docker-toolbox on OSX wont work with our compose files
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:54:09 GMT):<br/>
which means the mount didn't work
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:54:20 GMT):<br/>
is this OSX or windows?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:54:30 GMT):<br/>
Windows 7...
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:54:59 GMT):<br/>
ah...i dont know much about the platform, but I can say that older docker-toolbox/docker-machine on OSX was wonky until docker-for-mac came out
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:55:10 GMT):<br/>
all kinds of "kind of works, but not really" scenarios
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:55:16 GMT):<br/>
like port forwarding for example
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:55:42 GMT):<br/>
The nail in the coffin for me was when I tried to surface the dockerd port to the peer
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:56:07 GMT):<br/>
docker-machine supported TLS but not UDS, and docker-for-mac supported UDS but not TLS
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:56:17 GMT):<br/>
yeah... so we should probably have a warning in the doc and/or the release notes about that
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:56:18 GMT):<br/>
so, I picked one (the newer one)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:56:28 GMT):<br/>
@cbf ^^
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:57:00 GMT):<br/>
that said, I was not aware of problems in DRUN+volumes on docker-toolbox + win7, but I am not entirely surprised
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:57:30 GMT):<br/>
well, for alpha2 we faced a bunch of problems with mount also
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:57:42 GMT):<br/>
on toolbox+win7?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:57:44 GMT):<br/>
or in general?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:57:56 GMT):<br/>
on toolbox+win7
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:57:59 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:58:13 GMT):<br/>
the genesis block file wasn't mounting
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:58:25 GMT):<br/>
I changed the name of the file and it worked!?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:58:28 GMT):<br/>
for sanity, it might be more conservative to just say "native docker or docker-for-mac" for now, until we can get to the bottom of it
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:58:44 GMT):<br/>
I know those two generally should work (or I want to know about it)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:58:54 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:59:13 GMT):<br/>
its possible that toolbox+win7 is an easy fix, but I dont know enough about it to say
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:59:37 GMT):<br/>
well, I'll investigate further tomorrow
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 21:59:43 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 22:00:00 GMT):<br/>
for now it's midnight and my wife poured some whiskey ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 22:00:24 GMT):<br/>
as a simple test, you can always do something like "docker run -it --rm -v$(PWD):/opt alpine /bin/sh"
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 22:00:48 GMT):<br/>
ah, well you should go enjoy time with the wife (and whiskey)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 22:01:06 GMT):<br/>
well, that was a bit what I was doing with my docker run ... ls
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 22:01:08 GMT):<br/>

So it looks like I was asked for my thoughts on licensing for binaries and JSON files.  All files, regardless of type need to have licensing identified.  This can be done through a LICENSE file in the directory containing files that cannot contain a comment with the license information.  Here is a couple examples of how this can be done:
* OPNFV Apex: https://github.com/opnfv/apex/blob/master/LICENSE.rst -- this is an example of explicitly calling out Apache 2.0 for source code and CC-BY-4.0 for docs.  
* containerd: https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/README.md -- see notice at bottom.  This also calls out the separate Apache / CC-BY-4.0 docs, and explicitly references the "docs" directory.

The idea is that we should make sure that all files have a license specified, either by including it in the files where it can be included, or by having a separate file that calls out the license for those where the license cannot be included.

you're going to want to modify that to just write the gzipped tar file to disk (-o option) instead of piping to tar to unzip and then after a successful download, unzip yourself

@greg.haskins or @rjones just checking as I wasn't present for the last release, but the tags are created in a local clone and pushed to Gerrit, correct?
</p>

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 11:26:09 GMT):<br/>
because the fabric-sdk-java release notes were merged prematurely, we need to create a CR to actually populate the CHANGELOG.md that the release notes reference

<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:32:16 GMT):<br/>
this is the basic problem we have made in the past
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:32:46 GMT):<br/>
i.e. we create the release CR early, more changes go in, and then we simply hit the button on the release CR
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:33:01 GMT):<br/>
what we should do is some form of "rebase" first
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:33:28 GMT):<br/>
that could be literally a rebase of the release+prepare CRs...or perhaps there is an alternate merge strategy we can select in gerrit

your point is related to the one I had already added
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:41:54 GMT):<br/>
I've been pulling my hair all (european) day trying to get an environment where make peer-docker would successfully run
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:42:02 GMT):<br/>
on Windows 7
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:42:09 GMT):<br/>
this is a freaking pain
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:45:21 GMT):<br/>
so, here is a brief (as much as I can) summary: Docker Toolbox uses the MinGW environment which comes with Git but unfortunately this is missing the make command. And I have not been able to find a make that works. There is one but it generates Windows paths which docker run doesn't understand. And if I try to use cygwin make it generates a path that docker run accepts but fails to mount
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:46:05 GMT):<br/>
I tried all sorts of combinations to no avail
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:47:54 GMT):<br/>
interestingly, if I fix by hand the filepaths make generates and run the docker run command manually I can emulate make peer-docker all right
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:48:24 GMT):<br/>
I mean the go command completes all right
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:48:56 GMT):<br/>
so it's really a matter of getting the right make + docker combo
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:50:24 GMT):<br/>
I've managed to get Docker Toolbox running with cygwin instead of MinGW so I get the right make command but the mount of docker run still fails
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:50:56 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins ok. so what we'll need to do then is merge the release_notes CRs and then rebase the release CRs (I really should have combined them)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:51:12 GMT):<br/>
so I think we should have a note somewhere in the release notes or the end to end doc that people shouldn't expect this to work on Windows 7 (at least)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:51:17 GMT):<br/>
hence my note in the wiki
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:51:52 GMT):<br/>
@lehors only for people running make - we would not expect users to do that
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:51:52 GMT):<br/>
@lehors only for people running make - we should not expect users to do that
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:52:23 GMT):<br/>
right, I'm merely talking about end-to-end
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:52:32 GMT):<br/>
that's why getting started is better
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:53:05 GMT):<br/>
again, my problem is that currently the end-to-end doc implies this can be done on Windows running Docker Toolbox
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:53:54 GMT):<br/>
I will create a JIRA to document my findings and submit a CR to add a note to end-to-end.rst
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 12:54:33 GMT):<br/>

@cbf hi Chris, https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10159 needs two small (but one of them is critical) changes
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 13:32:02 GMT):<br/>
ok, thanks @jimthematrix for the sharp eyes that caught my cut-n-paste error;-)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 13:33:39 GMT):<br/>
@cbf - but I assume that we will actually be using the CHANGELOG that will be merged as part of the CR?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 13:33:47 GMT):<br/>
np had the benefit of quiet morning while waiting for my son to wake up ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 13:33:49 GMT):<br/>
the following CRs are ready to be merged https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10159/ https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10263/ https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10261/ https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10327/
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 13:34:08 GMT):<br/>
please review and +2 and I'll push the blue button
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 13:37:24 GMT):<br/>
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10159 is good to go

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 13:55:31 GMT):<br/>
ok, so the SDKs are ready to be merged. I cannot merge java, so @rickr or @jimthematrix will need to do that... once they have been merged, you guys can proceed to tagging the node and java SDKs per instructions in the relevant JIRAs FAB-4389 and FAB-4390

</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 13:56:48 GMT):<br/>
why didn't we catch this yesterday???
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 13:57:20 GMT):<br/>
@cbf @rickr updated comment on java patch.. 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 13:59:21 GMT):<br/>
ok updated
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:00:04 GMT):<br/>
thanks @cbf 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:01:23 GMT):<br/>
thx
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:02:59 GMT):<br/>
Was not on the that JIRA ... I think I want to update the README.MD too it  has an Alpha2 section
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:04:08 GMT):<br/>
probably just want to delete that
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:04:25 GMT):<br/>
delete the section?
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:04:29 GMT):<br/>
y
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:04:33 GMT):<br/>
ok, sec
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:06:06 GMT):<br/>
what about the valid fabric and fabric-ca commits? that's not right either
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:06:19 GMT):<br/>
thinking you would be best just updating after the release
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:06:31 GMT):<br/>
unless the README goes to maven or something
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:07:54 GMT):<br/>
@cbf src/test/fixture/sdkintegration/.env  should have the tag for what beta is going to be 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:09:15 GMT):<br/>
IMAGE_TAG_FABRIC=:x86_64-1.0.0-beta 
IMAGE_TAG_FABRIC_CA=:x86_64-1.0.0-beta 

</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:10:24 GMT):<br/>
People using the beta shouldn't use those ... they should pull from docker images .. that's why the .env file need changing 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:10:50 GMT):<br/>
can you do that in the commit ?
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:11:00 GMT):<br/>
@cbf ^^
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:11:06 GMT):<br/>
y
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:13:02 GMT):<br/>
ahh unless those images are published the verify builds will fail .. I would assume the sdk follow the fabric 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:18:12 GMT):<br/>
Did we expect an order to the release Fabric/Fabric CA publish then the SDKs ?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:35:12 GMT):<br/>
we should be able to push them out together... 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:35:16 GMT):<br/>
I updated the CR
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:37:39 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix you can tag sdk-node and push the modules to npm https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-4389 https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-4395
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:38:08 GMT):<br/>
https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10329/
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:38:23 GMT):<br/>
but having CI trouble to clear the build
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:38:54 GMT):<br/>
(other CRs in fabric-sdk-node suffering same problem since yesterday, already contacted CI team)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:39:28 GMT):<br/>
4395 as it is now is a duplicate of 4387 (both tasks accomplished at once)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:39:46 GMT):<br/>
i'll repurpose it for preparing the repo for rc1 development
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:55:08 GMT):<br/>
so, you want to manual verify?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:55:21 GMT):<br/>
is this intermittent?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:55:22 GMT):<br/>
i think it'd safe to do
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:55:35 GMT):<br/>
has been intermittent but today it's gotten worse
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:55:40 GMT):<br/>
all x86 builds failed
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:55:41 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:55:48 GMT):<br/>
all s390 builds were fine
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:56:04 GMT):<br/>
and also fabric's e2e verify that also runs the node sdk tests ran fine
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:56:21 GMT):<br/>
so it must have something to do with those specific VMs for the node sdk verify CI
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:58:01 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:58:50 GMT):<br/>
please +2 and merge https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10329
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:59:18 GMT):<br/>
I take it this depends on the fabric and ca being merged
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:59:35 GMT):<br/>
then I'll manually push the tag to github, then we can merge https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/10349
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 14:59:57 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:00:09 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins do we push the tag to GH or Gerrit... I would have thought Gerrit
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:00:18 GMT):<br/>
or at least once the docker hub publish were done
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:00:48 GMT):<br/>
I've always been pushing tags directly to github
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:01:08 GMT):<br/>
don't think you can do it with Gerrit
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:01:31 GMT):<br/>
I didn't think we could push to GH
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:02:20 GMT):<br/>
I learned that from @greg.haskins and was also surprised
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:03:04 GMT):<br/>
maybe it does: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17953713/how-to-push-tag-to-specific-branch-in-gerrit
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:03:25 GMT):<br/>
I used annotated tags anyway
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:03:32 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:05:46 GMT):<br/>
AFAIU GH is R/O 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:06:00 GMT):<br/>
if you tag GH then the tag does not exist in Gerrit
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:06:07 GMT):<br/>
(assuming you can)
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:09:53 GMT):<br/>
I tried to push like that to gerrit and got the permission issue.
Followed jims advise and  pushed the tag GH and it was ok showed up under releases 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:22:32 GMT):<br/>
@rjones @greg.haskins ^^ I'm a bit confused how tags end up in Gerrit if they are pushed to GH
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:23:40 GMT):<br/>
meanwhile https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10261/ is ready - had to manually verify due to flakey gosssip failure on Z but let's move forward... of course for tags, we need to get that sorted out
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:29:36 GMT):<br/>
gee no one around... I guess the release can wait a few more days - holy crap
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:29:36 GMT):<br/>
gee no one around... I guess the release can wait a few more days
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:43:24 GMT):<br/>
ok, verified that you CAN push tags to Gerrit, which is what we should be doing, I believe
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:43:36 GMT):<br/>
must be annotated, but we want that anyway
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:50:13 GMT):<br/>
 1786  git tag -aF release-notes.md mytag
 1787  git tag
 1788  git push origin mytag HEAD:refs/heads/master
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:50:53 GMT):<br/>
so, I don't know what the issue was previously but we should push tags to Gerrit IMO
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:51:05 GMT):<br/>
those should get mirrored to GH
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:53:28 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanLevi or @mastersingh24 can one of you please merge 10261 and 10263
</p>

thanks
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:55:16 GMT):<br/>
I did 10263 but need 1 more +2 on 10261
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 15:55:35 GMT):<br/>
@rickr and @jimthematrix you can merge 10327 and have LF sign and then push to maven
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 16:01:40 GMT):<br/>
@cbf  I really think we need to wait for the docker images to be there 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 16:01:54 GMT):<br/>
If I merge that it will fail 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 16:02:35 GMT):<br/>
never mind ... don't understand it  passed

the beta needs to be on the uncommitted lines 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 16:14:06 GMT):<br/>
?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 16:14:17 GMT):<br/>
checkout the patch and amend as needed
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 16:14:42 GMT):<br/>
so, apparently you can't use markdown in annotated tags
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 16:15:18 GMT):<br/>
HTML seems to be ok - but for instance lines starting with # are considered comments, not headings (DOH!)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 16:15:40 GMT):<br/>
so the release notes I added to the various repos aren't very usable

https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/blob/master/release_notes/v1.0.0-beta.md looks fine to me
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 16:38:19 GMT):<br/>
I used markdown syntax including headings which are '# foobar'
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 16:38:38 GMT):<br/>
and the # is treated as a comment so they were not carried into the tag's annotation
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 16:39:23 GMT):<br/>
so when  created the fabric-ca tag (which should be there) I changed to html
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 16:39:29 GMT):<br/>
hope that works;-)

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 16:48:02 GMT):<br/>
@cbf you (and all other fabric committers) should be able to push tags to the fabric project right now. I am rolling that out more generally right now.

fine by me (it's optional)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:10:51 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:26:30 GMT):<br/>
@jwagantall ^^^
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:27:34 GMT):<br/>
yes -- but I really want to see it verify
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:28:52 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu  I thought too that it's still a manual process
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:30:04 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:30:13 GMT):<br/>
when you create the tag... if you like, I can do
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:31:16 GMT):<br/>
sure - if you can 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:31:25 GMT):<br/>
ok, LMK when you merge
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:34:27 GMT):<br/>
yes @rickr at least for this release will do manual publish.. will automate this before next release.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:35:37 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu  ETA of Fabric docker images ? 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:36:07 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:36:18 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:56:25 GMT):<br/>
merged
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:58:31 GMT):<br/>
@rickr it still has a -2 from cbf
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 17:58:37 GMT):<br/>
so don't merge
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 18:00:04 GMT):<br/>
10305 ?
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 18:00:18 GMT):<br/>

@cbf worked on Mac host... will try vagrant now
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:06:03 GMT):<br/>
ok, did a clean run and it worked for me as well
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:06:19 GMT):<br/>
must have been some leftover partial success

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:23:53 GMT):<br/>
as I had indicated the getting-started curl command doesn't work on Windows 7 + Docker Toolbox
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:24:16 GMT):<br/>
for some reason the curl doesn't follow the redirect
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:24:35 GMT):<br/>
we would have been better off sticking with the true URL...
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:27:12 GMT):<br/>
AND not use a compact command that doesn't let the user know what happened
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:30:39 GMT):<br/>
@lehors that's ... a bit worrying
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:31:22 GMT):<br/>
would be nice to play well in windows env 
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:32:35 GMT):<br/>
something we can work on post beta perhaps worstcase and doc for now ? 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:33:02 GMT):<br/>
I'm trying but I get the feeling of being a bit ignored...
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:33:26 GMT):<br/>
I can help...what can I do ?

I'll even rebuild my vagrant env for that matter

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:36:27 GMT):<br/>
@harrijk tested this on windows 7
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:37:38 GMT):<br/>
I ran inside a Docker Quickstart Terminal
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:37:47 GMT):<br/>
on Windows 7
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:37:50 GMT):<br/>
what?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:37:54 GMT):<br/>
@lehors - I had the same issue as you
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:38:24 GMT):<br/>
I then installed curl natively on Windows and updated my PATH in the quickstart terminal
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:38:46 GMT):<br/>
But it does not seem to work at all on Windows 7 with Docker Toolbox
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:38:53 GMT):<br/>
at least the latest version
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:39:00 GMT):<br/>
it can't mount any of the volumes
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:39:44 GMT):<br/>
yeah, the env you get with Docket Toolbox is a mini MinGW which actually comes with Windows Git and is very limited
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:39:44 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:41:00 GMT):<br/>
it doesn't even have make
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:41:09 GMT):<br/>
I'm about to try Windows 10 and Docker for Windows
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:41:25 GMT):<br/>
@harrijk what is it that you ran in Docker Quickstart Terminal?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:41:42 GMT):<br/>
I ran the getting started in Docker Quickstart Terminal
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:42:22 GMT):<br/>
Well ... it was a bit of a hack... the curl command couldn't handle the redirect, so i issued curl using the redirected url.
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:42:31 GMT):<br/>
This downloaded all of the x86_64 images
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:42:43 GMT):<br/>
I then went into release/windows...
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:43:07 GMT):<br/>
ran network_setup.sh up beta 10
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:43:14 GMT):<br/>
all tests ran successfully
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:43:47 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 indeed, using cygwin curl works
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:44:06 GMT):<br/>
I can also confirm that
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:44:21 GMT):<br/>
ok, so we did the same
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:44:30 GMT):<br/>
it's not quite out of the box yet
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:44:38 GMT):<br/>
almost there...
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:45:23 GMT):<br/>
the short URL isn't worth the trouble
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:45:23 GMT):<br/>
@harrijk - Windows 7?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:45:33 GMT):<br/>
What does `docker version` show for you
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:45:37 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 Yes, Windows 7
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:45:44 GMT):<br/>
and what folder did you install in?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:45:51 GMT):<br/>
root of the quickstart terminal?
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:46:08 GMT):<br/>
yes, i installed in the root of the qt term
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:46:14 GMT):<br/>
so back from my cust call
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:46:24 GMT):<br/>
it works here on mac, I saw a couple windows
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:46:27 GMT):<br/>
Docker version is 1.12.0
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:46:33 GMT):<br/>
I did not, I installed into a different dir
</p>
<p><strong>silliman</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:46:45 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has left the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:46:59 GMT):<br/>
@lehors don't understand your concern with the short url
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:47:09 GMT):<br/>
we do want to track downloads 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:47:33 GMT):<br/>
it doesn't work with the curl one gets with Docker Toolbox
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:47:36 GMT):<br/>
we can add troubleshooting to the doc
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:47:49 GMT):<br/>
sure
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:47:57 GMT):<br/>
for windows?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:48:04 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:48:05 GMT):<br/>
what about it doesn't work
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:48:14 GMT):<br/>
I've been saying it for 2 days :)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:48:26 GMT):<br/>
it doesn't follow the redirect
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:48:39 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:48:44 GMT):<br/>
that blows
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:49:04 GMT):<br/>
so that's what people will see:

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:49:05 GMT):<br/>
$ curl -sSL https://goo.gl/LQkuoh|bash
bash: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'
bash: line 1: `<HTML>'
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:49:08 GMT):<br/>
have you tried installing a more recent version?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:49:09 GMT):<br/>
yep
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:49:17 GMT):<br/>
because it feeds the html to bash
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:49:34 GMT):<br/>
yes, I installed the latest this morning
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:49:34 GMT):<br/>
@lehors  - what does `docker version` show for you?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:49:45 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:51:04 GMT):<br/>
that's the problem
</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:51:06 GMT):<br/>
@lehors same thing with me
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:51:18 GMT):<br/>
but that's what one gets with Docker Toolbox...
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:52:16 GMT):<br/>
on cygwin I have curl 7.52.1 and that works
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:52:18 GMT):<br/>
@lehors - so once you replace curl and download the images, does it work?   I don't think it will.  I think it works with Docker Toolbox 1.12
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:52:21 GMT):<br/>
can u please try to d/l a more current version? https://curl.haxx.se/download.html
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:52:31 GMT):<br/>
We know that works @cbf 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:52:35 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 yes, it does
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:52:46 GMT):<br/>
so it's not so bad
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:52:50 GMT):<br/>
So e2e worked for you?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:52:54 GMT):<br/>
so, we need guidance to have ppl update to a more recent curl
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:52:56 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:52:59 GMT):<br/>
hmm
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:53:15 GMT):<br/>
I was on an earlier rev of Docker Toolbox
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:53:19 GMT):<br/>
let me upgrade
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:53:25 GMT):<br/>
17.03
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:53:26 GMT):<br/>
cbf, yes but it's not so easy to do unfortunately
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:53:34 GMT):<br/>
do tell
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:54:01 GMT):<br/>
because we aren't using the standard Windows commands
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:54:10 GMT):<br/>
we use MinGW
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:54:16 GMT):<br/>
which is a bit like cygwin
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:54:25 GMT):<br/>
it gives a Minimal GNU Windows env
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:54:41 GMT):<br/>
but it's not even the standard MinGW
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:54:52 GMT):<br/>
so when you try to update it it's a freaking mess
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:55:05 GMT):<br/>
yeah - but it is likely based on one of the later versions of mingw as well
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:55:09 GMT):<br/>
I spent the day trying to update it to get a make command that works
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:55:15 GMT):<br/>
and couldn't figure it out
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:55:24 GMT):<br/>
it's kinda silly that we need to run Unix emulation for Windows
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:55:25 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 yes
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:55:39 GMT):<br/>
yeah
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:55:40 GMT):<br/>
I don't even like piping to bash
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:55:45 GMT):<br/>
well, it's not silly, it's the only way to survive on Windows! ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:55:52 GMT):<br/>
we could just have a BAT file
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:55:55 GMT):<br/>
get a mac
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:56:00 GMT):<br/>
lol
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:56:06 GMT):<br/>
you can run docker and docker-compose from Windows cmd prompt
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:57:15 GMT):<br/>
@cbf is that what you're going to tell all the devs out there stuck with Wndows?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:57:17 GMT):<br/>
so, lehors, can you please submit a CR to add windows troubleshooting to the GS
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:57:30 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:58:05 GMT):<br/>
and at the end, it can say they can simply curl the tarfile and unzip and execute themselves but leave that for last
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:58:22 GMT):<br/>
as noted in one my JIRA comments the piping to bash makes things worse
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:58:24 GMT):<br/>
I was unable to get it to work with Docker Toolbox 17.03.0-ce
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:58:34 GMT):<br/>
because when it fails you're left with nothing to investigate
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:58:43 GMT):<br/>
upgrading to 17.05.0.-ce
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:58:43 GMT):<br/>
upgrading to 17.05.0-ce
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 19:59:19 GMT):<br/>
if at least we did something like curl xxx > bootstrap.sh && bash < boostrap.sh one could look what's in bootstrap.sh
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:00:55 GMT):<br/>
why can't we just download the script and/or the zip file and then run the script?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:01:15 GMT):<br/>
you tell me!
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:02:08 GMT):<br/>
because someone likes the `curl ... | bash` concept
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:02:10 GMT):<br/>
;)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:03:02 GMT):<br/>
I guess so :)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:03:31 GMT):<br/>
I figured feeding the file to bash is to avoid problem with the file not being executable
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:03:55 GMT):<br/>
which is reasonable
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:04:26 GMT):<br/>
but piping directly the curl output is too optimistic
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:06:25 GMT):<br/>
@lehors - I assume your username on Windows has no spaces in it?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:06:36 GMT):<br/>
correct
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:06:39 GMT):<br/>
it's lehors
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:07:06 GMT):<br/>
Mine is "Gari Singh" - so artifacts failing to generate
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:07:58 GMT):<br/>
ah...
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:08:30 GMT):<br/>
now I have vagrant failing because it doesn't support my newer version of docker. Oh joy!

@greg.haskins @rameshthoomu https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10413/ - I have added a target(s) to create a tar file for the release binaries and given it a flatter structure. The intention is also to keep separate from the e2e sample so that the release binaries can be used by installers like homebrew.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 19:14:45 GMT):<br/>
next step will be to package up the e2e_cli 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 19:28:13 GMT):<br/>
ok so now `make dist-all` generated tar file per platform.. I have to publish two artificats (tar files and e2e_cli package tar) to nexus ??
</p>

proposed process for weekly releases
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 10 Jun 2017 13:33:05 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu @cbf Concerning making the tar into a 'flatter structure'... I thought @rameshthoomu had a specific reason for the prior tar structure in alpha2 timeframe, if my memory is right it had something to do with ensuring the e2e had access to the other chaincodes like marbles02.  May not be important, but just wanted to ensure @rameshthoomu takes a good look at the new structure relative to the structure that was put in place for alpha2, and confirm that we are ok.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 10 Jun 2017 13:34:20 GMT):<br/>
Speaking of structure, given weekly releases nexus is going to get busy given the flat structure.  May be better to have a directory per /release/platform in nexus? 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 10 Jun 2017 15:24:35 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart what's in the tarfile has nothing to do with the fabric repo structure - and conflating the two is what makes what we deliver unnecessarily complex
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 10 Jun 2017 15:25:40 GMT):<br/>
we need to be able to deliver binaries and images independent of samples, whether e2e or the new "writing your first app" especially so that we can leverage the likes of NuGet and Homebrew to have legit installers for our tools

Anyone seen issues with peer instantiate getting the following type of errors on beta 1```017-06-13 15:40:24.082 UTC [grpc] Printf -> DEBU 010 transport: http2Client.notifyError got notified that the client transport was broken unexpected EOF.```
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:46:05 GMT):<br/>
seems like connection to orderer is broken
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 16:15:08 GMT):<br/>
what do the orderer logs tell you?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 13 Jun 2017 16:15:23 GMT):<br/>
also this isn't related to #fabric-release , let's take it to another channel please? :)

@scottz  posted this on another channel so copying here- Please take a look at the updated Hyperledger-Fabric System Verification Test (SVT) report for v1.0, available @here : 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E3-PXchMOWm6DC5xq6RN-NT2YmngKNcG_zQqW0ireY4/edit?usp=sharing
It shows the system test summary on first tab, plus a breakdown by "Test Area" in the following tabs which contain individual testcases. We even created Jira tasks to describe each testcase. This report does NOT include everything such as Unit Tests or other manual tests done by various community members, but hopefully it satisfies questions about system test coverage. 
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 16:38:31 GMT):<br/>
@scottz , @weeds : 1. Thank you. 2. Can we email it to the (fabric) mailing list as well?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 16:39:02 GMT):<br/>
It's a great report @scottz , thank you!
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 16:40:31 GMT):<br/>
yes, was planning to email it out after giving maintainers a preview :)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 16:41:31 GMT):<br/>
BTW: If you want to share stuff with the maintainers, the recommended way is to have one of the maintainers' putting it forward on the maintainers channel, on your behalf.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 16:42:12 GMT):<br/>
It's true for PRs, prioritization, discussions, and of course for sharing docs, reports, or sharing info amongst them.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 16:44:19 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanLevi I know people don't necessarily pay attention to it but I think it would make sense to expand no the info attached to the #release channel to make the policy clear
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 16:44:19 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 16:45:23 GMT):<br/>
even though it says it is meant for internal discussion among the maintainers, you could make it clearer that non maintainers should not post there
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 16:45:33 GMT):<br/>
OK, when I have some time later on today, I can formulate an email or so.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 16:46:00 GMT):<br/>
Good point @lehors , I know that people are not doing it "on purpose". 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 16:46:27 GMT):<br/>
email wouldn't hurt but I'm talking about the description of the channel
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 16:46:54 GMT):<br/>
you know the stuff that gets displayed when you hit the little i
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 16:47:57 GMT):<br/>
set it to something like: "DO NOT POST HERE unless you're a maintainer" :)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 16:48:25 GMT):<br/>
otherwise it looks like a channel where one should go to talk to the maintainers
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 16:48:43 GMT):<br/>
Oh, I see....
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 16:49:16 GMT):<br/>
Yes, "we really don't want to make people believe that they should talk to the maintainers " <---- I'm joking
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 16:49:26 GMT):<br/>
lol
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 16:50:23 GMT):<br/>
OK, let me update it. It should be really a "read only" thing for non-maintainers/community managers.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 16:50:53 GMT):<br/>
So that we have these in the open. Of course we could (have) close(d) that channel, but that would defy the whole point.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 16:51:13 GMT):<br/>
of course to respect the #fabric-maintainers policy I polluted this channel now ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 17:21:30 GMT):<br/>
@lehors - you pollute all channels - so it's ok  ;)
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 17:32:30 GMT):<br/>
I'm afraid this is merely called jetlag :)

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 17:32:51 GMT):<br/>
BTW (and sorry I'm talking about "work"): seems like we are getting a lot more interest/exposure in China these days.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 17:33:20 GMT):<br/>
Several people have contacted (me), or through the mailing list, asking if they should use fabric.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 17:33:46 GMT):<br/>
seems reasonable for the #fabric-release channel
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 17:34:05 GMT):<br/>
but now I'm no longer responsible for polluting it! :-P
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 17:34:17 GMT):<br/>
I should have warned them about @lehor being on every fabric channel, of course, the main concern was regarding "how ready" it is.

<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 17:36:03 GMT):<br/>
We should "show off" with how quiet the release channel has been (meaning, no issues), but then again that was before @lehors ' jetlag kicked in.

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 13:31:02 GMT):<br/>
@cbf - the root of your issue is the env variable I posted above - you are missing `msp` at the end of localmspdir
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 13:31:42 GMT):<br/>
I'll assume that you are actually running in the `/Users/cbf/dev/go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/sampleconfig` directory
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 13:31:58 GMT):<br/>
ah thanks
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 13:32:12 GMT):<br/>
well, no
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 13:32:37 GMT):<br/>
actually, was running from somewhere nowhere near the fabric repo
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 13:33:06 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 13:33:15 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 13:33:58 GMT):<br/>
does it look for sampleconfig if it cannot find the msp directory?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 13:34:50 GMT):<br/>
when it cannot find your MSP, it tries to create one (well bccsp does).  Since you used a relative path, it picks something relative to config path (core/config package)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 13:35:10 GMT):<br/>
I usually just set FABRIC_CFG_PATH to be safe
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 13:35:28 GMT):<br/>
but it all stemmed from not finding the MSP
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 13:36:49 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart you have to replace **byfn** with **current working dir** name in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/master/first-network/base/peer-base.yaml#L15
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 13:37:58 GMT):<br/>
before replace you have to trim the current dir name.. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 13:38:18 GMT):<br/>
is this in the instructions?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 13:38:23 GMT):<br/>
it should be like this `firstnetwork`
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 14:11:58 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu Setting the peer-base.yaml CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE got me further, but i'm hitting another error during chaincode instantiate now: 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 14:12:07 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 14:28:09 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu why is the CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE tied to the CWD?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 14:28:15 GMT):<br/>
that makes no sense
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 14:28:38 GMT):<br/>
that means that the compose file isn't portable?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 14:46:28 GMT):<br/>
I am not quite sure why it is tied to CWD but that's how it is working.. I see network mode is not specified in docker-compose file..  @mastersingh24 could you please provide your inputs please.. 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 14:50:21 GMT):<br/>
maybe that should be removed?

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 15:05:22 GMT):<br/>

@rameshthoomu oh sorry did not see that
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 15:11:20 GMT):<br/>
So here's the network "issue"
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 15:11:26 GMT):<br/>
besides, had to update the basic-network one as well
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 15:11:32 GMT):<br/>
But it's not actually hard to solve
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 15:14:50 GMT):<br/>
So by default, when you run Docker Compose, it will create a bridge network.  By default, the nae of the network is the *name of the current folder* plus *_default* - so assuming the compose file is in a directory called *firstnetwork*, the Docker network created will be called *firstnetwork_default*

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 15:16:59 GMT):<br/>
Normally, one would not care at all about this.  The reason we need to care is because when the peer launches chaincode, we need the chaincode container to be able to talk to the peer (and when you use TLS we need the hostname the chaincode uses to access the peer to match the CN/SAN in the TLS certificate used by the peer).  
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 15:17:35 GMT):<br/>
So in order to solve this, we need to connect the chaincode containers to the same bridge network as the peer(s) is (are) running on
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 15:17:35 GMT):<br/>
So in order to solve this, we need to connect the chaincode containers to the same bridge network as the peer(s) is (are) running on so we leverage `CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE` which allows you to specify the bridge network the container should join
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 15:21:12 GMT):<br/>
so, we should make that a varianle
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 15:21:12 GMT):<br/>
so, we should make that a variable
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 15:21:55 GMT):<br/>
If we truly want to make the compose files portable across directories (not sure we really want to take this on now), we can do a few things:

1) require that people pass the `--project-name=firstnetwork` and keep `CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE=firstnetwork_default`

2) we can leverage the `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` environment variable
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 15:22:24 GMT):<br/>
But honestly, how much do we want to try to explain to people?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 15:23:02 GMT):<br/>
I don't think we should do anything for rc1 though
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 15:26:06 GMT):<br/>
why not just CORE_VM_DOCKER_HOSTCONFIG_NETWORKMODE=$COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME ?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 15:26:15 GMT):<br/>
is that what you meant?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 15:46:33 GMT):<br/>
We would have to set COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME is a .env file though
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 15:55:31 GMT):<br/>
@cbf do we want the release binaries ( /bin directory) within /first-network or as a peer directory?  The automated byfn assumes the latter, the manual byfn instructions assumes the former. e.g.:
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 15:55:35 GMT):<br/>
`./bin/cryptogen generate --config=./crypto-config.yaml`
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 16:49:42 GMT):<br/>
If you have suggestions/additions that you believe we should consider/add to the release notes (of any version)... by all means.

@mastersingh24 I have updated patch https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10913/ with your suggested changes.. @cbf 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 18:57:26 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart there are other samples that need them... the way they get installed should be in the root of fabric-samples and invoked ../bin/peer etc
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 18:57:36 GMT):<br/>
@cbf I’ve run through the complete Build Your First Network. A few minor issues:
1) The network name issue - already being worked: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10913 
2) The byfn.sh assumes /bin is in a peer directory to /first-network, while the manual instructions assume that /bin is in a subdirectory of /first-network. Which one is correct?
3) The Using CouchDB section uses marbles02 chaincode (JSON based), however the marbles02 chaincode is not available as an example within /first-network. Do we want to copy marbles02 into fabric-samples?  (I don’t like having multiple copies in source, ‘fabric' and 'fabric-samples', due to dual maintenance concerns.  I assume we’ll eventually remove them from ‘fabric’?)
4) In the doc the manual instructions still reference -p during chaincode instantiate. -p has been removed. This causes an error.
5) In the doc there are some old section name references, which do not exist after the doc refactor - can be fixed together with (4)

<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 11:53:11 GMT):<br/>

also, I should add that there's a potential licensing issue with the PKCS11 dependency
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 11:54:54 GMT):<br/>
it wasn't clear, but apparently they don't want us releasing a RC until we resolve it - I am working on a call with the legal team at LF
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 11:55:23 GMT):<br/>
and I am working with Gari to see if we can just omit PKCS11 dependency and people can add it themselves if they want to use it
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 11:55:58 GMT):<br/>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=C2qBsAzRnq34DmiLx) @cbf I haven't been following along, but my general thought on PKCS11 support is it should be off by default
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 12:26:06 GMT):<br/>
not sure that helps the legal issue 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 12:26:30 GMT):<br/>
well, as the quality of my work on Weds shows, everyone has limits of sleep depravation before their work suffers
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 12:26:31 GMT):<br/>
I am envisioning its turned on a) when the user asks, or b) by the packager (when appropriate)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 12:27:05 GMT):<br/>
turning on or off is not the problem @greg.haskins 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 12:27:13 GMT):<br/>
by default it is off, yes
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 12:27:14 GMT):<br/>
("user" above is someone building from source)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 12:27:43 GMT):<br/>
to be clear, i mean the default build should be "GOTAGS = -pkcs11"
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 12:27:57 GMT):<br/>
only only +pkcs11 on demand
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 12:28:00 GMT):<br/>
(IMO)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 12:28:35 GMT):<br/>
so, dont even link it in to the build unless the tag explicitly turned it on
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 12:29:05 GMT):<br/>
right now, they want it removed from source
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 12:29:21 GMT):<br/>
which IMNSHO is silly
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 12:29:23 GMT):<br/>
my argument is: it makes 0 sense to do +pkcs11 in a docker container, and its painful for people to need to deal with libtool-dev when they dont care
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 12:30:19 GMT):<br/>

@mastersingh24 if you want to have a look, my patch is https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/11093/ but I don't think this should be applied for this release - it's still a bit too rough for my taste and I don't see the need to rush this in

</p>

</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 20:02:02 GMT):<br/>
speaking of whether to change the URL or the script behind it when we cut a new release, we also need to learn to keep the old versions of the doc in place
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 20:02:20 GMT):<br/>

@mastersingh24 https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10827/ I addressed in the follow-on CR as it was less rebasing madness involved
</p>
<p><strong>bretharrison</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 20:56:12 GMT):<br/>
@cbf @mastersingh24 When should  we change the NodeSDK version number,  once test gives the OK tomorrow or when we declare the release GA. If we do it tomorrow then should the version number be 1.0.0-rc1  only to be replaced again with 1.0.0 when we are GA ?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 20:56:47 GMT):<br/>
@bretharrison where is that done?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 20:56:55 GMT):<br/>
the version should be 1.0.0-rc1
</p>
<p><strong>bretharrison</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 20:57:38 GMT):<br/>
There are files called package.json under both fabric-client and fabric-ca-client
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 21:00:35 GMT):<br/>
so those need to be changed now?
</p>
<p><strong>bretharrison</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 21:01:06 GMT):<br/>
if they get changed now then this will cause a publish to NPM
</p>
<p><strong>bretharrison</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 21:01:48 GMT):<br/>
so I would think once we are happy , then make that change to cause the publish
</p>

@rameshthoomu I thought we merged that change

hyperledger-fabric-${ARCH}.${VERSION}.tar.gz .. Problem is with the `.` before the VERSION.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 22:48:27 GMT):<br/>
it should be `-`..

ok
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 22:49:18 GMT):<br/>

ok, so aside from the binary download location, and fabric-sdk-java I think we are good to resume merging to fabric, fabric-ca and fabric-sdk-node

i got the following early this morning- All looks pretty good. Ratnakar found https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-4988 and submitted patch set https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/11119 with some changes from FAB-4904. ...nothing major so far has been found

looks like this was to fix the sample for write your first app (thank you Ratnkar for finding this)

Everybody, by all means, please can you spend some time today and tomorrow and try things out. Starting from the samples/guides, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Sat, 24 Jun 2017 14:20:47 GMT):<br/>
We would like to make a Big Announcement [TM] and call for others to test this with us, so anything/the more we can tackle this weekend - the bettter.

i have been playing with byfn.  i got a timeout instanciating chain code once in several times..  but as discussed with ramesh barry probably a docker networking thing.  
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Sat, 24 Jun 2017 14:23:57 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @simsc. Does anyone else experience something similar to this ^^^
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Sat, 24 Jun 2017 14:24:49 GMT):<br/>
We log anything that's suspicious - but yes, when it doubt, we can "pair" and check that issues are reproducible/consistent/etc.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Sat, 24 Jun 2017 14:26:11 GMT):<br/>
Do we think that the "docker networking thing" being a configuration/set up issue? *Feel free to file/issue/log things*. We can close issues if/when others chime in.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Sat, 24 Jun 2017 15:01:49 GMT):<br/>
@simsc you are testing on mac yes?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Sat, 24 Jun 2017 15:04:05 GMT):<br/>
Yes, we need info. System, O/S, environment, and how to repro. This way, others can help in verifying.
</p>
<p><strong>simsc</strong> (Sat, 24 Jun 2017 15:14:31 GMT):<br/>
yep, i spent some time with ramesh Thursday in the lab,  he felt sure it was a docker related item.

@simsc we have cleared all the docker containers, images and did `./byfn -m generate` and `./byfn -m up` it worked.. Also, we observed network is too slow on your machine.

The quality team has successfully performed some general testing on the release candidate images. The testing covered areas to include, 
- end-to-end flows driven with the node and java SDKs as well as the cli
- various chaincdoes driven through the cli
- stressing the orderer
- gossip (taking peers up and down)
- running through the 'Building Your First Network' and 'Writing Your First Application' from the documentation 
- ensuring all 'make' commands succeed
- the node SDK is  published to npm (and tested) and the java sdk will be published to maven once FAB-4522 (https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10965 ) is merged

Over the next week the quality team will ensure the system testing is performed against the release candidate images. The system tests to be performed are all described in the https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E3-PXchMOWm6DC5xq6RN-NT2YmngKNcG_zQqW0ireY4/edit#gid=1852797754.

I"m in the Glossary. when i click on links such as configuration block which was in green or gossip which was in gossip protocol- the color turns to grey (the other words still remain green). is this intended?

@lehors not on Windows, so just a guess here -- could be some docker ps left over from previous run;  try to clean all ps and connections; ie `docker rm <id>`  and `docker network prune`
</p>

ok, maybe try to debug with CLI by doing the same query to see if you can connect to the peer

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 24 Jun 2017 20:37:53 GMT):<br/>
The issue is that localhost will not work on Windows

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 24 Jun 2017 20:38:17 GMT):<br/>
You need to replace it with the IP that Docker Quickstart terminal prints out
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 24 Jun 2017 20:38:58 GMT):<br/>
ok, why doesn't localhost work?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 24 Jun 2017 20:40:43 GMT):<br/>
Because Docker Toolbox uses Virtual box and it only sets it up on a bridge network
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 24 Jun 2017 20:41:13 GMT):<br/>
so when Docker exposes a port, it exposes it on the Virtual Box network which is only bound to the brige network

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 24 Jun 2017 20:42:42 GMT):<br/>
Recall that in the Vagrant dev environment we specifically expose ports on the host system but if you tried to run Docker even in the dev Vagrant image and used a different port you would not see it on localhost
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 24 Jun 2017 20:43:37 GMT):<br/>
anyway - that's my theory as to why it's not working

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 24 Jun 2017 20:43:46 GMT):<br/>

Just ran through "Writing your first application" on Linux, with Node 7.10 (which I know is not officially supported), but encountered no errors.  Not a showstopper, but `query.js` seems to use a mix of spaces and tabs which makes it look pretty ugly depending on your tab width.

Hi, 
I went over the two tutorials (https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#tutorials) and applied the instructions step by step. It worked like a charm.

I have one (minor) comment: The user is prompted to go over “Writing your own application” tutorial first (https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/write_first_app.html) and then for the “Building your first network” (https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_network.html). 
If one tries to do them in this order, then the first part of the second tutorial would output an error (some containers already exist from the previous tutoria). Perhaps some link to how to clean up your setup at the end of the second tutorial or the begining of the second would be helpful for the beginners.

writing your first app should be refactored to use basic-network which has a teardown script that woukd avoid this.

I'm sure it's known but in case it isn't - it looks like the `-e` flag in `writing your first app` isn't supported in earlier docker versions (i.e 1.12.5), 
in the `Prerequisites` page it is said that ` Docker v1.12 or greater is required.` but I have `1.12.5` and the `-e` flag didn't work for me and also isn't present in the `docker exec --help` list:
```
Usage:	docker exec [OPTIONS] CONTAINER COMMAND [ARG...]

Run a command in a running container

  -d, --detach         Detached mode: run command in the background
  --detach-keys        Override the key sequence for detaching a container
  --help               Print usage
  -i, --interactive    Keep STDIN open even if not attached
  --privileged         Give extended privileges to the command
  -t, --tty            Allocate a pseudo-TTY
  -u, --user           Username or UID (format: <name|uid>[:<group|gid>])
```
Perhaps we should re-write the script to not use the `-e` flag?

</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sun, 25 Jun 2017 21:54:53 GMT):<br/>
I would suggest a more recent version of Docker, frankly
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 25 Jun 2017 21:56:47 GMT):<br/>
yeah - we should recommend the latest CE version when we publish 1.0.0
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 25 Jun 2017 21:56:53 GMT):<br/>
But -e has been around for a long time
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 25 Jun 2017 21:56:59 GMT):<br/>
Since way before 1.12
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 25 Jun 2017 21:57:14 GMT):<br/>

which version are we testing with?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sun, 25 Jun 2017 22:27:32 GMT):<br/>
yeah, I looked through the release notes and didn't find a mention
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sun, 25 Jun 2017 22:28:23 GMT):<br/>
agree we should probably recommend latest... at the very least we should update prerequisites to indicare which version we are tasting
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 10:27:41 GMT):<br/>
Why update the prerequisites just because of this `-e` flag though? 
all our scripts in fabric work with docker 12.5. 
Maybe just update the script to not use `-e` ? 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 11:11:48 GMT):<br/>
well, we are not testing against versions that old for starters - we shouldn't be making claims we cannot really defend
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 11:13:11 GMT):<br/>
ok, well in that case I guess we need to crank up the minimum version

Some exit criteria are listed here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric/release_exit_criteria . Is there anyone planning to create a subpage for each release (v1.0, v2.0...), to permanently post artifacts such as: the crypto export compliance audit results, the jira bug report summary showing no high/highest bugs, scan result showing no license violations, results of security scans (static and dynamic), etc. etc.  
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 21:57:13 GMT):<br/>
Ramesh and I were thinking that would be a good possible home for the final code coverage report for the actual v1.0 release, and a snapshot of the summary page (or more) of SVT test results, rather than creating multple links on that main fabric wiki page to subpages for each item.

@JonathanLevi  I don't see that wiki mentioned in your email to the distribution list, so maybe it is not a good formal place for those items; do you have another ideas if those things should be collected or where they could be stored?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 22:07:23 GMT):<br/>
Which things specifically?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 22:07:34 GMT):<br/>
1. "final code coverage report"

<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 22:07:48 GMT):<br/>

</p>

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 22:08:37 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 22:08:58 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 22:10:21 GMT):<br/>

Please be a bit more specific @scottz - so that I don't give the wrong answer in case I didn't understand or a "blank check" over things that I will need to run by all the fellow maintainers. THanks.

</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 13:18:42 GMT):<br/>
also the release criteria is just that, criteria - not a page to post other stuff
</p>
<p><strong>simsc</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 13:53:55 GMT):<br/>
At one point we discussed adding a QA section to the wiki.  The section could be an overview of test coverage describing UT coverage including links to jenkins unit tests  and svt coverage with links pointing to svt doc, etc, etc.  
</p>
<p><strong>simsc</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 13:54:44 GMT):<br/>
This would not be tied so much to release criteria, but a describe test coverage in general

@elli-androulaki just a nit
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 13:59:08 GMT):<br/>
having version info in the docs is just adding technical debt
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 13:59:52 GMT):<br/>
I am looking under "Releases" heading on wiki https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric . There are links to v1.0.0-alpha* content and release testing (which is a descriptive doc). I am suggesting to declutter, because I agree we do not want to add several beta links and several RC links here. I imagined a link to a subpage for release v1.0.0, which could contain/describe any materials.
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 14:00:51 GMT):<br/>
I figured we would have to store artifacts showing we met the release criteria. If not, then we could get rid of these alpha links.
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 14:01:37 GMT):<br/>
And the FAQ that Clayton mentioned could contain a link to test info or a troubleshooting/debugging page or whatever.

Today- i got 2 questions from 2 different people trying to use the latest release candidate- they indicated that it was hard to find https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/   link in the documentation to figure out how to quickly pull the images.  Maybe we need to make it more prominent?
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 15:32:17 GMT):<br/>
I don't personally have suggestions where to put it myself 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 15:33:12 GMT):<br/>
These particular people were not looking for walking through write your first app,etc,.. as they already had experience with the fabric at v1.0 prior releases (ie beta,etc,.)

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 15:35:42 GMT):<br/>
it could be clearer that this is how you get the binaries and images

As part of the 1.0 release, one of the things that has been requested is an FAQ. I believe that we can use the following document for this purpose: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric/welcome. One thing that I see missing from this document is something that highlights the differences between v0.6 and v1.0. Is this documented somewhere that we can pull into the FAQ (even if just as a link)?

@JonathanLevi I have re-triggered e2e job on latest commit and it worked as expected.. https://jenkins.hyperledger.org/view/fabric/job/fabric-merge-end-2-end-x86_64/
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 13:13:25 GMT):<br/>
I see couple of failures with java e2e tests.. it seems orderer timeout issues causing these failures.. Will check with @rickr and create a JIRA item for the intermittent failures
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 13:18:51 GMT):<br/>
1. Thanks.
2. Please take a look at the commit logs:

Success Build #932 (Jul 5, 2017 11:44:00 AM)
Failed Build #931 (Jul 5, 2017 10:30:00 AM)
Failed Build #930 (Jul 4, 2017 7:29:33 PM)

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 13:19:11 GMT):<br/>
We had a failure at #930 
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 13:19:32 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 13:20:31 GMT):<br/>
Why are these tests so brittle...? ( <--- forwarding a question that I have just been asked)
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 13:22:34 GMT):<br/>
Below are the reason for the failures (#930, #931)

#931 00:19:03.932   End2endIT.setup:209 Send transactions failed. Reason:  timeout

#930 00:23:55.218   End2endIT.setup:209 Send transactions failed. Reason:  timeout
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 13:23:28 GMT):<br/>
Will work with @rickr to increase the time to avoid these timeout issues.. 
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 13:33:16 GMT):<br/>
Yes, please. Thank you @rameshthoomu and @rickr !

https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5107 is a high bug against samples. It wasn't previously tagged as 1.0.0.  I've fixed the tagging, so it may show up in bug reports now. Does anybody know if this is being actively worked?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 10 Jul 2017 18:24:45 GMT):<br/>
Since it is a sample docker compose issue and not a fabric runtime bug, I have reduced to Medium.

when do we fix up the docs to remore rc1?
```
Look at the names for each image; these are the components that will ultimately comprise our Hyperledger Fabric network. You will also notice that you have two instances of the same image ID - one tagged as “x86_64-1.0.0-rc1” and one tagged as “latest”.

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:12:49 GMT):<br/>
this is tricky because it apparently depends on the git program used
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 22:13:34 GMT):<br/>
unfortunately on Windows 7, the git that comes with Docker Toolbox does exhibit the problem and this is what we tell people to use...

Jonathan- i don't have all the specifics, but throughout the day on Tuesday there was not just the 3 hour testing that you are aware of but various testing that the team did
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 02:04:19 GMT):<br/>
I will have to ask the various people that reached out to me to post more specifics but this is some of the information i received:
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 02:06:01 GMT):<br/>
@elli-androulaki indicated to me that her, Angelo, Ale  tested the network overall, but also tested security components across the fabric.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 02:07:26 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart tested basic network, basic ledger updates and queries on leveldb and couchdb as well as some deeper ledger testing. 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 02:08:10 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm tested the basics of fabric and also did very deep and thorough testing of gossip. 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 02:09:48 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix tested fabric builds and node.js and java SDK sniff tested  and did deeper testing.. he tested manually some of the sample apps 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 02:10:56 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr did some testing on chaincode, some of the vendoring pieces, and then went a bit deeper on chaincode elements. 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 02:11:59 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick  did do quite a bit of consensus specific testing - ran through the paces and hit a bit deeper
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 02:12:34 GMT):<br/>
@lehors helped us with the windows environment specifically (he always is the master of finding things in windows others do not- seems to look good)
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 02:13:14 GMT):<br/>
@smithbk did quite a bit of testing on the CA
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 02:13:45 GMT):<br/>
AGain, as you know we have a lot of automated tests that were run that cover these areas... but several people had wanted to do some manual testing "just because"
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 02:14:14 GMT):<br/>
I would ask all those that are tagged here post a bit more specifically what they tested if it would help you, but I do want to thank you for leading today.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 02:15:16 GMT):<br/>
You also are aware that we did a lot of security testing with outside firms that was shared with our security maven for Hyperledger and the maintainers and security auditing.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 02:15:41 GMT):<br/>
@binhn personally did testing as well- 
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 02:16:38 GMT):<br/>
I'm sure there are others that I'm not highlighting here-- I know that there were a whole team of people that @scottz had running both automated and manual testing throughout the day to check the release across all areas.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 02:17:08 GMT):<br/>
In any case, I would ask that those on this list that I have mentioned - posting a little more detail for Jonathan might be helpful.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 02:17:12 GMT):<br/>
Thank you Jonathan

I did leave out one bit- I know several people walked through the documentation with the release as well and followed the steps to make sure they worked with the new release- and they did
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 02:23:25 GMT):<br/>
@nickgaski can probably add his work as well in this space
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 02:25:12 GMT):<br/>
I re-tested the readthedocs samples including Build Your First Network and Writing Your First App on mac.  Doc content looks good (after a couple minor fixes that were pushed).  BYFN automated and manual steps worked flawlessly on both leveldb and couchdb. WYFA had one issue in the SDK sample which is fixed by https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/11205.  Tested the various ledger functions/queries including rich query, history queries, and the query system chaincode functions.

I retested the dev mode instructions, especially for non-admin channel creation.  I also ran some stress tests with some performance tooling I have been working on, hitting the orderer with 200 concurrent connections driving traffic as fast as possible and everything seems stable and correct.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 10:57:16 GMT):<br/>
I tested fabric deployment on VMs with https://github.com/yacovm/fabricDeployment that tests gossip block dissemination (single leader per org) and also used https://github.com/sandp125/FabricNodeAPI_V1 which also adds a new organization to a channel, and I analyzed the gossip logs in it to ensure that peers of the new added org eventually communicate properly with gossip. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 11:10:44 GMT):<br/>
Also I have done performance benchmarking of gossip in small networks (8 peers) and it seems that the gossip network can withstand bursts of hundreds of blocks per second (blocks are 100KB of size, and the hosts each have 4 CPUs)
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 13:03:30 GMT):<br/>
Ramesh ran all our daily test suite automated tests, touching many areas, which are now part of a releaseTestSuite (and will publish a jenkins job report after rerun today). This suite now includes many additional tests including "make" commands, e2e tests, BYFN, and other tests using sdks too - over and beyond the UT and behave tests that are run with every submission. Plus we put some manual focus on the areas touched by fixes merged since RC1 (orderer, gossip, vendoring) and ran some chaincode integration tests and some system integration tests using PTE. Furthermore we manually verified the v1.0.0 images, binaries & node-moduels using the following samples
1. BYFN (fabric-samples / first network)
2. Balance-transfer
3. fabcar
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 13:12:00 GMT):<br/>
And we also looked through all the files for mentions of "rc1", fixed some, and confirmed the rest were all fixed by Nick and others by late afternoon.

@scottz hi, are there any estimates for when to expect the features specified at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/proposals/r1/Next-Ledger-Architecture-Proposal.md?
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 13:36:44 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=fk5JH2KrkXKkXcL4h) @uber.twin Much of that content is provided with version v1.0, released earlier this month. If you have a question about specific capability, please post it and an architect or release manager should be able to answer with more information. Right now they are planning for v1.1.
</p>
<p><strong>uber.twin</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 13:46:18 GMT):<br/>
@scottz thanks, I'd like to know what options are there to restrict access for certain assets to their respective owners and I thought a feature or two listed in there may help, such as "The complete ledger may not reside on all committers". As an alternative, might there be an option to encrypt the ledger and the world state?
</p>
<p><strong>uber.twin</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 13:51:49 GMT):<br/>
@scottz the reason would be related to the requirement that when two parties are transacting an asset, they might like to keep that transaction secret
</p>
<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 14:05:46 GMT):<br/>
You are askinga about client private data. There is some work being done in this area now; take a look at FAB-1151, and ask @dave.enyeart . As for whether the entire ledger could be encrypted, I am not sure about that.
</p>
<p><strong>uber.twin</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 14:09:59 GMT):<br/>
alright, thank you
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 14:43:33 GMT):<br/>
@uber.twin The first answer for private data between participants is to use separate 'channels'.  A channel provides private communication and ledger between a subset of network participants.

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 14:47:33 GMT):<br/>
Channels work well for many scenarios.  But in some scenarios you need everybody in the network to have visibility to some public global data, while some of the transaction data should stay private.  In these scenarios a hash of the data can go on the chain and the private data is saved 'on the side' by authorized peers.  That's where FAB-1151 comes in, it will be targeted to a future release.

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 15:06:35 GMT):<br/>
@uber.twin If somebody hacks into the peer or peer docker network, all bets are off. only the peer public APIs should be exposed.  You must protect everything behind the peer public APIs.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 15:07:28 GMT):<br/>
even with LevelDB somebody that hacked into peer could mount a program to read the data
</p>
<p><strong>uber.twin</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 15:09:33 GMT):<br/>
but isn't each peer suppose to be administrated by its owner?
</p>
<p><strong>uber.twin</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 15:10:24 GMT):<br/>

</p>

@uber.twin  you are talking about deployment strategies, and network security between business entities within an organization. Fabric developers do not dictate how to use it. The Fabric is flexible and can be used in many ways by the network architect who must decide how to configure and permission their network gateways, peers, and servers that run the client applicaiton code. Explore the use of channels and consortiums first, to do what you want, and then FAB-1151.

the peer owner/administrator is authorized to see all data on their peer.  they cannot access other peers or other peer's couchdb.

We have the release binaries here for fabric https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/releases/org/hyperledger/fabric/hyperledger-fabric/linux-amd64-1.0.0/ which seems quite useful, but the lack of parity for the other components is surprising

@mastersingh24 for cutting 1.0.1 the fabric-sdk-node and fabric-sdk-java repos can just be tagged at the master HEAD. would you like Rick and I to do the necessary steps for CI triggering and tagging? or are you handling them all?

I went with `git rebase -i HEAD~28` based on some practices I saw from other projects.  But I hear you on the sign of the actual merge commit, although it did an additional signed-off by to each commit listed in the commit msg
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 17:08:56 GMT):<br/>
I _feel_ losing `git bisect` and no longer having 1:1 commits is a heavy price to pay for future debugging.

I think, possibly, we should have a `future point release` version and create new versions with numbers when the decision is made to roll forward with a new release, but let's cross that bridge in the future

i wanted to share some information here that I've asked @scottz to share on email for hyperledger as I don't know that everyone has this information, but I thought it was a great summary
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Fri, 15 Sep 2017 14:19:35 GMT):<br/>
Several people in community that Scott has been leading have created new repo "fabric-test" at end of July, with testers as maintainers. This has allowed people who have more automation development test skills to move forward much more quickly. And tools are getting merged that have been utilized to test the various releases. And the tests are intended to continue to get integrated into the CI.
 

    Ledger Traffic Engine (LTE)
        merged 8/10, 1400 lines
        functional and performance testing of APIs for ledger component
    NetworkLauncher (NL)--> intent here is to ultimately move to Cello
        merged 8/29, 2500 lines
        used on command-line or invoked by other tools; internally uses cryptogen, configtxgen, creates and uses docker-compose files;   launches configurable network on a single host
    Performance Traffic Engine (PTE)
        merged 9/08, 7000 lines
        system testing traffic engine configurable with a command-line interface and test configuration files
    Behave major framework
        merged 8/07 - 9/12, 4500 lines, plus 1100 lines of growing feature test files
        user-friendly language for network operators and users

Still TO DO is below:  merge tools infrastructure into fabric-test repo:

    Add Behave functions for more tests as needed
    Orderer Traffic Engine (OTE)
        target date to complete merging 09/29 -- unblocks 30 tests
        configurable test engine for orderer service component: multiple orderers, kafka brokers, channels; drives broadcast and deliver clients and verifies all traffic msg counts
    Cello - fabric network deployment tool
        target date to complete merges 09/29 -- unblocks 10 tests, plus more planned
        cannot yet obtain cloud machines from LF; backup plan (being tested) is to utilize vLaunch machines in cloud

There are tremendous amount of tests that are "system related" (this is beyond the basic already automated unit/function test) that we are trying to get automated into the CI ultimately.  So if anyone is interested in helping with that effort of getting it moved over I suggest to reach out to @scottz

Anyone know what happened to the `latest` tagged docker images?

@jyellick we have (intentionally) never published them to dockerhub....they exist purely as a construct of developer convenience and are generated when you build locally
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 18 Sep 2017 19:23:02 GMT):<br/>
everything that is on dockerhub is designed to work with like-tagged images
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Mon, 18 Sep 2017 19:23:02 GMT):<br/>
Ah, thanks Greg, does our CI push anything to dockerhub on merge to master?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 18 Sep 2017 19:23:18 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick  no
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 18 Sep 2017 19:23:39 GMT):<br/>
as far as official releases, def not...i wasnt clear on intermediate states but it seems Ramesh has answered that one too
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 18 Sep 2017 19:23:51 GMT):<br/>
only after release tag is created
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 18 Sep 2017 19:24:22 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick if you dig in, you will see docker image tags fall into two categories
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 18 Sep 2017 19:24:46 GMT):<br/>
1) those which are strongly versioned and linked to each other, and 2) those which assume the developer context of :latest
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 18 Sep 2017 19:25:23 GMT):<br/>
most of the primary components fall into (1)...things like behave scripts often rely on (2) out of convenience with the premise that wouldnt be used outside of development/CI context
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 18 Sep 2017 19:25:59 GMT):<br/>
e.g. its a PITA to pass "x86_64-snapshot-e4a5b3" to the behave setup, so it uses :latest
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Mon, 18 Sep 2017 19:26:19 GMT):<br/>

You'll also notice that the Makefile will also tag images as latest and you'll notice that the download script for the binaries from the getting started also retags images as latest as well
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 19 Sep 2017 13:58:07 GMT):<br/>
We also had to deal with the lack of multi-arch support in the past as well.  We actually need to start leveraging that capability of Dockerhub now so we can get rid of the arch in the tags

Noticed by @jworthington, it looks like the `orderer` binary in the v1.0.2 release artifacts reports its version as `development version` rather than as `v1.0.2` like all the other binaries in the release.

Two proposals for your consideration:
*1) Jira enhancements* - With current Jira setup, it is difficult to get a good view into release content.  I would propose enhancing Jira Features as follows - split current Description into Overview/Motivation, Internal Design, and Usage sections.  Then add fields for Status (one line free text summary), Design Reviewed (no, yes (or reviewer names)), SDK Impact (unset, no, yes), Doc Required (unset, no, yes), New System Test Required (unset, no, yes). For any yes, feature must have respective subtasks completed prior to marking Done.
*2) 1.1 Alpha content* - Without good release visibility in Jira, for now I’ve summarized proposed 1.1 release content and 1.1 alpha highlight areas in a google sheet. An alpha highlight area is a 1.1 feature that is complete enough to warrant requesting early feedback on in the short term. These are focus areas for Doc and System Test leading up to an alpha release sometime in October.  Please take a look  and either comment inline or here with thoughts. As always, you can up vote a feature in Jira. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TswRWap0MO-CVSLWbGnBzUPQp4SaWUeflRgkxZFh1t0/edit#gid=0
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 21:08:09 GMT):<br/>
Is there an example for (1) ? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 21:09:34 GMT):<br/>
do you mean to split the description _ always_ or can it be opt-in ? because if one doesn't fill all the fields won't that leave the JIRA with lots of blank fields when you browse it?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 21:18:30 GMT):<br/>
I believe it is possible to pre-populate Jira fields with templated values... assuming that is the case I'd suggest keep current Description field and upon work item creation populate it with Overview/Motivation, Internal Design, and Usage sections.  With recommendation for people to fill out as many of them as feasible.  We'd like all this information collected for new features.  Reviewers care about Internal Design, while users and documenters care about Usage.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 21:20:10 GMT):<br/>
As today, a link to a google doc can be included if the content is lengthy.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 23:39:22 GMT):<br/>

Having Epics and then we break it down to the sub-components (in this case, they'd be the NodeJS, Go, etc...)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 23:41:16 GMT):<br/>
I think that the Design should be at the Epic level
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 23:41:59 GMT):<br/>
Internal designs that are closely related to the implementations (and may vary between implementations) can act like "special" derivations

<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 23:44:44 GMT):<br/>
While at it (and I fully agree that these need organization) - what will (also?) be key is our ability to use ETAs along with these dependencies. I feel that this could use some improvements, as it's difficult at times to figure out the ripple effect of a key feature not getting done on time / as planned, how how it directly or indirectly affects some deadlines and milestones.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 04 Oct 2017 23:45:19 GMT):<br/>
Back in the day, I do remember many many reports that stated that everything green, but many things didn't work.

We should certainly have a much better JIRA state of the *1.1 Release* (alpha or otherwise)

@dave.enyeart  - I am not opposed to adding fields, but I don't think we need to (at least not to start with).  What we need to do is actually add "release" discipline and provide prescriptive guidance on the usage of types, etc
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 09:36:41 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 Exactly... the prescriptive guidance and discipline will make all the difference.  The additional fields is just some structure to nudge the discipline in the right direction, plus they would enable interesting reports to more easily get a thumbnail view of a release (similar to the google sheet)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 09:36:41 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 Exactly... the prescriptive guidance and discipline will make all the difference.  I am going to create a wiki page with the prescriptive guidance.

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 10:24:51 GMT):<br/>
I personally prefer the use of "New Feature" and "Improvement" versus "Story".  For some odd reason, "story points" does not show up for either of these.  We also need people to get into the habit of using "Tasks" under any of these.  Tasks can be used to include docs, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 10:25:27 GMT):<br/>
I also like this view:   https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10002&version=10702
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 10:26:50 GMT):<br/>
Sadly, we can't quite use these as our release notes because we have multiple projects under one JIRA project, but I like this view because it gives you a perspective on describing a release
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 10:27:08 GMT):<br/>
In the end, this all comes down to proper planning of release content
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 10:30:53 GMT):<br/>
BTW - as part of trying to clean things up, we now have both "v1.1" and "v1.1-experimental" available for "fix version"
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 10:32:37 GMT):<br/>
Also added v1.2 as well

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:08:30 GMT):<br/>
I have asked @dhuseby to request some JIRA ninja consulting, because we could sorely use some;-)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:09:52 GMT):<br/>
the absence of story points on features and enhancements seems arbitrary... I would hope we could add them
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:11:07 GMT):<br/>
because (and I was recommending this with @simsc and @weeds way back) we need to be more rigorous about planning. It isn't enough to just put a JIRA up with a title and nothing else. 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:13:09 GMT):<br/>
then we need to be doing planning... again, I have suggested this multiple times that before we jump into coding, we need to a) agree as maintainers what our priorities are and b) we need to assess whether there is resource to actually do the work we prioritize and map that to a release cadence
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:16:08 GMT):<br/>
so, I support template that Dave proposed... the missing piece in all of this is that we need to be a lot more brutal in how we manage code being merged
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:17:21 GMT):<br/>
IMO, if we require voting of all New Feature and Improvement JIRAs or else related CRs are rejected, that might get people into the habit of playing ball
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:18:20 GMT):<br/>
eg only planned and approved JIRAs can get merged (bug fixes and small performance tweaks or new tests should obviously be exempt from this).
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:20:46 GMT):<br/>
as to release 1.1 visibility, I actually worked on a new gadget for the dashboard that captures what was posted in the wiki (and aligned the two)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:20:53 GMT):<br/>
see the upper left hand gadget
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:21:24 GMT):<br/>
I would prefer that we not create yet another place where our plan of record is maintained
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:21:59 GMT):<br/>
while JIRA is not in an ideal configuration - we should just work with the tools we have and not scatter information to more places for it to become out of sync
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:23:56 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:25:24 GMT):<br/>
well, I think that this is one of those situations where we could throw out a bunch of requirements but that would suggest a solution
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:25:38 GMT):<br/>
To @cbf’s point, most large open source projects require demonstration of an “intent to implement” discussion before any code will get merged. 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:26:06 GMT):<br/>
what we want to be able to do in the simplest case is plan out what new features are going to be in a release and plan as to whether it is likely to make it in time

</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:27:18 GMT):<br/>
If it’s the maintainers, then I would suggest doing an email process:
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:27:40 GMT):<br/>
1) send a list of features do 1.1 to the list and ask for others?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:28:38 GMT):<br/>
2) once you have a list, then make moodle where people are allowed to select their top 5 or so. 
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:28:54 GMT):<br/>
3) that creates a ranking of features based on community consensus. 
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:29:22 GMT):<br/>
Then you figure out how many of the top priorities can make it into the next release.

should we just send the list one more time (explaining its already be sent a couple times).   explain this will be the content unless there is feedback
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:39:53 GMT):<br/>
@simsc so you might double check that your communicating where people can hear you. But @cbf if you gate on trying to force people to reply, lots of stuff will get stuck.

0) its posted in wiki where all the release content has been historically posted 1) sent email to hyperledger community 2) posted it  in fabric-scrum rocket channel more than once  3) gari presented and showed wiki with content at hackfest.

JIRA is not hard - frankly I could set it up with the right access

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:45:25 GMT):<br/>
BTW - IMHO the ship has sailed for 1.1 other than dropping stuff.  For right or wrong, that's where things are.
For 1.2, we can get cracking an put the right process in place.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:46:24 GMT):<br/>
And I just want to state that every open source project has a core group of people who do set the direction / priority for the project.  Of course you need feedback, etc and should do this in the open, but I don't want people thinking this becomes a free for all
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:46:58 GMT):<br/>
I really don't see why this is so hard to be honest.   ;)

I'm pro-putting-project-in-charge-of-jira. What hamstrings me is there isn't a division between "can manage user facing parts of JIRA" and "has admin access to the whole thing". If you recall I gave you admin access, @cbf, and I got spanked for doing that.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 16:07:21 GMT):<br/>
The best I could do is something like "screenshare with @mastersingh24 and let him drive" or something, which is pretty wonky
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 16:49:53 GMT):<br/>
@rjones - so even being part of the `JIRA Administrators` group (as opposed to the `JIRA System Administrators` ) is out of the question?  Even if only for say a week or so?  ;)

<p><strong>agrimberg</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 16:52:41 GMT):<br/>
We don't grant systems level administration access to anything that we manage. We'll grant _project_ admin to the committers of a project or their requested proxies. But not global rights like that
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 16:55:38 GMT):<br/>
That's problematic because unfortunately as @rjones pointed out you can't do anything useful to customize JIRA as a project admin
</p>
<p><strong>agrimberg</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 16:56:39 GMT):<br/>
Give us clear requests via ticket and we'll make changes
</p>
<p><strong>agrimberg</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 16:57:19 GMT):<br/>
We've had far too many projects request such powers and then cause problems for their entire community to allow it to happen anymore
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 22:37:02 GMT):<br/>
@agrimberg I think a lot of the problem comes from the fact that a lot of us are chafing with JIRA and want some changes but we're not sure of exactly what we want.  I think I'm getting a sense that we want somebody who is an expert in deploying/customizing JIRA for organizations that can come in and gather requirements and tell us what they know would work for most, if not all of our requirements and then set it up for us.

hey all, i know v1.0.3 is out but I saw on npm that fabric-client and fabric-ca-client are both still at v1.0.2. will there be a v1.03 release for the node sdk or is v1.0.2 compatible?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 14:22:00 GMT):<br/>
v1.0.2 compatible
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 14:22:00 GMT):<br/>
v1.0.2 is compatible
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 14:23:15 GMT):<br/>
```
Friends and family,
 
The Hyperledger Fabric maintainers are happy to announce the v1.0.3 release of both Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Fabric CA.
The binaries / Docker images are available for download here:   http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/samples.html#binaries
 
The release notes can be found here:
 
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/releases/tag/v1.0.3
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/releases/tag/v1.0.3
 
Please note that none of the SDKs released a v1.0.3.  The existing SDKs will continue to work with v1.0.3.
 
Enjoy!

@dhuseby Just to add on- Sometimes it is a little hard to determine how progress is going in the dashboards, because "done" number for Jira does not really go up. But if you look at overall subtasks, you see quite a bit of work by so many developers across community. I"m not sure if there is a better way to show some of this, but that can sometimes be a challenge.  And, I always wonder what impression it leaves community in terms of progressing projects.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:30:39 GMT):<br/>
Also on comments up above from Clayton- we honestly did put in rocket chat several times, the email forum several times and had Gari present at hackfest- is there something else we are missing> I just worry we bring up these topics and we don't have a "true" resolution in terms of what we are not doing right- people do want to do the right thing, but it is honestly frustrating when we are told to do one thing and then given different direction- we need to be consistent
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:49:58 GMT):<br/>
Is the fabric-ca released as a binary eyt?
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:49:58 GMT):<br/>
Is the fabric-ca released as a binary yet?
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:50:08 GMT):<br/>
And is there any plan for that?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:50:10 GMT):<br/>
@Asara  - no
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:50:10 GMT):<br/>
@Asara  - no - we don't publish binaries.  And yes - we should publish a binary of the fabric-ca-client.  Should happen in the 1.1 timeframe (although we can look to see if we can do it earlier)
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:52:29 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @mastersingh24 
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 19:58:13 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 Is there a binary for the fabric-client-ca? 
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 20:00:21 GMT):<br/>
I ask because if not that is the only thing you need to install golang in compile/use.
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 20:10:49 GMT):<br/>
Woops I misread what you wrote.  I meant to ask about the fabric-ca-server not client :)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 20:21:45 GMT):<br/>
We really don't publish binaries of the runtimes.  We stick with Docker images
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 20:22:39 GMT):<br/>
I mean the peer/orderer are released as binaries.  Any reason that isn't the case for the ca?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 20:30:51 GMT):<br/>
We did the peer becuase unfortunately the peer can also be used as a CLI.  Not sure why we did the orderer actually
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 20:32:03 GMT):<br/>
Why so against providing binaries? 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 20:38:32 GMT):<br/>
because then we get into platform support issues
</p>
<p><strong>Asara</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 20:41:21 GMT):<br/>
Makes sense.

Hi, I have a question. What is the planned schedule of v1.1 release?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 24 Oct 2017 10:08:34 GMT):<br/>

@weeds will performance improvement (e.g., https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5932 ) be included in 1.0.x anytime soon?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 24 Oct 2017 21:08:20 GMT):<br/>
@sachikoy No, that perf improvement is under the Epic "Performance and scale improvements for 1.1" https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-6421.  In general only bug fixes are ported to 1.0.x, while features and improvements will go into 1.1.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 24 Oct 2017 21:09:12 GMT):<br/>
That perf improvements is in current master and will therefore be included in the 1.1 'preview' in coming weeks.

Things are shaping up for a 1.1 ‘preview’ release, as early as next week.  For the definition of a ‘preview’ release, see https://wiki.hyperledger.org/community/release_taxonomy.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 11:54:18 GMT):<br/>
Features in 1.1 that will be ready to try out in the preview include:
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 11:54:26 GMT):<br/>
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-2331- Node.js Chaincode
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5363 - Node.js SDK Connection Profile
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-830 - Encryption library for chaincode
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5346 - Attribute-based Access Control
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-6089 - Chaincode APIs to retrieve creator cert info
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-6421 - Performance improvements
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 11:54:32 GMT):<br/>
Each of these have had some level of early success, through a combination of community trials, system test, and Composer test.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 25 Oct 2017 11:54:46 GMT):<br/>
A few TODOs before the ‘preview’ release:
- There is a todo to simplify the encryption library and example: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-6751 I’ve discussed with @aso.
- I think we will want to publish images that are built without experimental tag @rameshthoomu
- I have looked at all highest and high defects, all the ones that I’d like to get into preview are IN REVIEW already.  I’m highlighting reviewer name here:

@dave.enyeart, @troyronda, are you planning to support Java Chaincode in 1.1? As I know if you build 1.1 preview with experimental tag it will be there.

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 02:36:50 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda @lmars FAB-1151 private channel data has changes coming later in 1.1 and is therefore not a highlight area for 1.1 preview. An experimental image with FAB-1151 is not intended for 1.1 preview.  I do not think Java Chaincode will be a production feature in 1.1.  Maintainers will meet closer to 1.1 ship date to determine which of the features are production ready versus which features need to be hidden behind experimental tag.
</p>
<p><strong>lmars</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 02:52:42 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart, This is weird that Java Chaincode isn't supported.

yes?

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 15:18:13 GMT):<br/>
@cbf Right, I'm not seeing any reason to cut a fabric-sdk-java for 1.1.0-preview. Although I have a question out to @rickr in case he wants to showcase anything new.
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 15:39:08 GMT):<br/>
Not planning to.  I'm currently not really aware of anything that's needed from an SDK for _1.1.0-preview_  to support Fabric/ca    The JSDK has also SNAPSHOTs being published that can get the very latest commited code if desired.

I see failures in behave tests (like channel creation taking couple of sec's extra than the specified timeout value etc..) docker containers are not coming up in specified time..

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:20:28 GMT):<br/>
not a post build failures.. seems orderer images is unavailable or not didn't find this before it try to trigger from dockerhub.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:21:52 GMT):<br/>
ok. I don't think there is much I can do.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:45:34 GMT):<br/>
the orderer images missing is actually a flaw in the approach of using the "PREV_VERSION" to select the image tag
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:45:56 GMT):<br/>
I manually verified the fabric-ca CRs that were failing
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 17:46:42 GMT):<br/>
but what this highlights is that we NEED to be saving interim image builds in Nexus's Docker registry so we can pull them for adjacent builds
</p>

@jimthematrix I need you to tag fabric-chaincode-node

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:26:57 GMT):<br/>
 fabric-chaincode-node and fabric-ca are failing CI due to same reason as before - can't find the 1.0.0-preview orderer and peer images
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:26:59 GMT):<br/>
@here the 1.1.0-preview is complete except for validating stuff works as expected
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:27:14 GMT):<br/>
weird
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:27:27 GMT):<br/>
:)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:27:46 GMT):<br/>
but I think it is because they are looking for a tag x86_64-v1.1.0-preview whcih doesn't exist yet
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:28:22 GMT):<br/>
is the push to dockerhub in progress?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:28:36 GMT):<br/>
I was just about to ask @rameshthoomu 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:28:50 GMT):<br/>
pushing the tag should have triggered
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:30:17 GMT):<br/>
fabric-chaincode-node needs to redo their two: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/15085/ and https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/15087/  , since the wrong package.json was updated the first time around
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:30:34 GMT):<br/>
they were worried about CI failure
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:30:53 GMT):<br/>
but i think they can manually verify (CI failure due to cant find the other images)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:31:25 GMT):<br/>
so i'll ask @jimthematrix to merge those two, and THEN tag the new commit
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:33:50 GMT):<br/>
yes I all triggered.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:33:50 GMT):<br/>
yes all release jobs triggered.. 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:33:57 GMT):<br/>
thanks
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:34:13 GMT):<br/>
I see fabric-ca release jobs are failed.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:34:33 GMT):<br/>
Once the fabric orderer, tools and peer images are published will re-trigger these jobs.. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:35:22 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix says that for fabric-sdk-node and fabric-chaincode-node the push is triggered by the merge CI, rather than the tagging. So those will likely fail.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:36:07 GMT):<br/>
the tag is created on the merge?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:36:12 GMT):<br/>
i don't think so
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:36:19 GMT):<br/>
the NPM publish may be
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:36:29 GMT):<br/>
but then the repo isn't tagged 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:36:59 GMT):<br/>
yes npm publish works on merge job based on the release version.. 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:37:07 GMT):<br/>
this is definitely an area we need to synch up because it is unnecessary complexity to have things behave arbitrarily differently 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:38:02 GMT):<br/>
we publish `unstable` npm modules if it is snapshot
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:38:20 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu fabric-chaincode-node has version 1.0.0-preview while fabric is 1.1.0-preview.  Will that cause a problem?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:38:26 GMT):<br/>
we should publish those to Nexus
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:38:30 GMT):<br/>
not NPM
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:38:49 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart yeah, that was my observation earlier
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:38:51 GMT):<br/>
I went with it
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:38:58 GMT):<br/>
either way it seems weird
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:39:16 GMT):<br/>
eg first release is 1.1 or it is inconsistent with fabric releases
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:39:49 GMT):<br/>
yeah, it is weird but i'm asking @rameshthoomu if it will actually break any assumptions in the scripts?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:40:54 GMT):<br/>
no.. @dave.enyeart 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:41:05 GMT):<br/>
ok, so it is weird but acceptable
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:41:05 GMT):<br/>
ok, so it is weird but workable
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 19:41:47 GMT):<br/>
fabric-chaincode-node merge builds are failed because we have an issue in building fabric-ca-orderer etc.. images

sdk, node.js chaincode, platforms
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 20:35:48 GMT):<br/>
Currently testing the preview with node.js container support with composer. It's looking good so far
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 20:36:26 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart did some couchdb performance improvements go in very recently ?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 20:37:02 GMT):<br/>
couchdb perf improvements have been in for a month or two
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 20:38:25 GMT):<br/>
thought I had a more recent level of the source code when testing today before the preview. Just running against the preview our query system tests went through at such a rate I thought they may not be working
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 20:39:16 GMT):<br/>
did you have indexes in place for couchdb?  that makes all the difference.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 20:39:16 GMT):<br/>
did you have indexes in place for couchdb queries?  that makes all the difference.
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 20:39:26 GMT):<br/>
No, no indexes
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 20:39:57 GMT):<br/>
if you have any volume of data, you'll need indexes to get good performance on rich queries
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 20:41:02 GMT):<br/>
In this case the volume is low as these as automated system tests which set up a few assets and participants to query. but before each test took a few seconds to run. Now The whole batch took just a few seconds to run
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 20:41:30 GMT):<br/>
i'll take it
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 20:42:43 GMT):<br/>
Will investigate more tomorrow but it is looking good from a composer (via node.js chaincode) point of view. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 20:47:36 GMT):<br/>
@davidkel are you using sdk connection profile as well?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 20:48:53 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart No the branch I have is just dedicated to the node.js chaincode support. We have another branch for the connection profile stuff but that works fine against 1.0.x still
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 20:53:24 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart feel free to send the email after you edit - I need to bug out to head down to Ft lauderdale 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 20:53:32 GMT):<br/>
or I can send later this evening
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 22:02:51 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart  - do you also want to include an announcement for v1.0.4 as well?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 22:09:36 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 I'd suggest keep them separate, go ahead and announce 1.0.4

</p>
<p><strong>harrijk</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 23:07:40 GMT):<br/>
I managed to get a clean e2e test on Windows, but had to make the following changes...

1. Edit fabric-samples/first-network/docker-compose-cli.yaml and change ...
 ```

        - ./crypto-config:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/
        - ./scripts:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/scripts/
        - ./channel-artifacts:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/channel-artifacts

```
to ...

```

        - ./crypto-config/:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/
        - ./scripts/:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/scripts/
        - ./channel-artifacts/:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/channel-artifacts

```
2. Remove the carriage return characters (^M) in fabric-samples/scripts/script.sh by issuing `dos2unix.exe fabric-samples/scripts/script.sh`

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 00:57:41 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 00:58:50 GMT):<br/>
Note that in the v1.1.0-preview docs we have people clone the master branch of fabric-samples, so we'll be able to make enhancements after today's v1.1.0-preview release

@jimthematrix @bretharrison Need you to tag the fabric-chaincode-node repository with v1.0.0-preview.  This is the last of the repositories to be tagged for the preview.  As we get closer to alpha, we'll need to make a decision of whether to promote it to v1.1.0 to be aligned with the other components.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 01:11:30 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 00:46:34 GMT):<br/>
Is there published anywhere the release targets dates for 1.1.0-alpha and 1.1.0 ?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 02:19:27 GMT):<br/>
@rickr Given remaining work items and velocity, my best guess is alpha in December and release in Q1.

this is all up to community but the hope is beta in jan and release in feb... but it depends on velocity of course and how well we do with defect backlog, testing,etc,.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 19:22:47 GMT):<br/>
so that's just a "guess"
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 19:23:17 GMT):<br/>
and of course did the features get done to make alpha in December since the list has been identified as to what had to be done by community

Hi all,
</p>
<p><strong>PreetCS</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 05:23:51 GMT):<br/>
how to write, run and deploy chaincode in ibm bluemix  ?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 10:16:51 GMT):<br/>
@PreetCS  - I'd suggest posting your question here:  https://developer.ibm.com/answers/topics/blockchain/?smartspace=bluemix

<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 13:44:52 GMT):<br/>
Is cryptogen not producing TLS certs for the client /peer/order et al ?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 14:38:57 GMT):<br/>
@rickr  - not sure if you are asking about producing client certificates for mutual TLS?  If that's the question, then the answer is no.  I've slowly been working all of the mutual TLS tasks and will likely add TLS certs for the clients generated by cryptogen.   No need to do that for the orderer and the peer actually uses the same cert for both server and client TLS
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 14:53:03 GMT):<br/>
So the plan for mutual TLS is just to use the peer's server TLS certs for the client?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 15:57:35 GMT):<br/>
Sorry - not - the peer
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 15:57:35 GMT):<br/>
Sorry - no - the peer's will use their server certificate and their client certificate for communicating with other peers and the ordering nodes.
I'll update cryptogen to generate some client certificates for the sample clients.
But I need to think a bit more about exactly what we want to do for integration tests first

</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 13:34:36 GMT):<br/>
Does anyone know how I can go about doing this? https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/15143/
</p>
<p><strong>simsc</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 14:27:36 GMT):<br/>
As a community, it would be helpful to establish a cadence and schedule for playbacks.  

Playbacks are intended to allow contributors to present a proposal or provide progress on a particular feature, to get feedback from the community. There will be a best effort to hold this on Monday and Tuesday at 10:00 - 11:00 EST to accommodate different geos and work week schedules. Weekly scrums are a great place to propose topics and get on the agenda. #fabric-scrum

Here is a place on the wiki to help track and manage the playbacks  https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric/playbacks

Please look for web conference information in the #fabric-playbacks channel prior to meeting starting.

Lets try and see how it goes!

https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-6042  is any part of this in a garrit CR ?  Can the client/sdk get the resource config from the peer  ?
Are the exact details of this new Resource tree defined and confident we're settled on it ? Are protopuf changes still pending (ID  object some protobuf artifact) ?
Would it be possible to have a _concrete_ example  of chaincode in this resource tree.  What type of hash is required ?  Over what ?
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 15:42:10 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick  @mastersingh24  ^^ ?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 15:48:44 GMT):<br/>
@rickr there is https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/15479/ from @aambati and I'm working on the peer CLI side of it, I hope to release a functional working change set by end of tomorrow if that is any help
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 15:54:38 GMT):<br/>
I have the code that calculates the Configupdate  from new to updated block.  The next big step would be knowing *exactly*  how the Resource tree needs to be modified to get updated block. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 15:55:53 GMT):<br/>
I guess maybe you can look at https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/15461/7/peer/chaincode/resources.go 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 15:55:55 GMT):<br/>
Getting the existing resource block and then doing those modification 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 15:56:03 GMT):<br/>
I have the code here and I _ hope _ it's correct
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 15:56:09 GMT):<br/>
but only @jyellick can verify 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 15:57:49 GMT):<br/>
I think it would be helpful for all sdks if a more concrete example of the Resource tree would be provided in the JIRA

@jyellick @rickr Will this new `Resources` config tree have any values that are bytes, and if so will the name be used as in the channel config to indicate how to decode those bytes?
</p>
<p><strong>jyellick</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 17:27:00 GMT):<br/>
@bretharrison Yes and yes, config values are always encoded as bytes, and we follow the same naming scheme.  The protos have already been merged, if you take a look at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/protos/peer/resources.proto
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 17:37:16 GMT):<br/>
Ok --  good to hear.  Bret and I are planning to have a utility that follows that pattern so given the `name` it's a simple lookup to determine what it's to be decoded as.  I hope the name will be unique anywhere in the tree ?

Hi @sanchezl  I know _officially_ Node CC should be supported in 1.1 ( I think with out doing any changes at all ) What's the story for Java CC ? Same level of support active by default ? Still need to change code to enable ?

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 15:57:15 GMT):<br/>
Java CC is already hidden behind experimental build tag, meaning it will not be in 1.1, but people can build in experimental mode if they want to play with it.
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 17:21:37 GMT):<br/>
I treat `experimental` as not supported.
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Tue, 05 Dec 2017 17:22:15 GMT):<br/>
I suppose the Node CC is not `experimental` and is enabled by default ?

If I start a new project now, do you recommend developing under 1.1-preview or 1.0.5? 
Meaning, is the preview stable enough for development purposes?

<p><strong>nasht00</strong> (Mon, 11 Dec 2017 08:20:31 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 11 Dec 2017 11:55:59 GMT):<br/>
1.1.0-preview has gone through a full round of system testing, it is certainly stable enough for development purpose.  1.0.5 and 1.1 are compatible so the eventual migration would not be a problem either.

<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 23:13:19 GMT):<br/>
yes, the tag is what actually kicks the pipeline
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 23:13:33 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 23:13:44 GMT):<br/>
do you want to do?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 23:13:54 GMT):<br/>
the IS_RELEASE variable only serves to direct the artifacts versioning 
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 23:14:00 GMT):<br/>
sure, standby
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 23:14:06 GMT):<br/>
thx
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 23:15:31 GMT):<br/>
ah, looks like the version was committed wrong
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 23:15:33 GMT):<br/>
let me investigate
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 23:17:01 GMT):<br/>
ok, it only happened one commit ago
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 23:17:52 GMT):<br/>
the _most_ convervative thing to do would be to bump the version one more time (v0.4.4)
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 23:17:55 GMT):<br/>
any objections to that?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 23:18:10 GMT):<br/>
otherwise, i can cut a v0.4.3 but theres an impurity in the process
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 23:18:15 GMT):<br/>
its not a huge deal either way
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 23:33:00 GMT):<br/>
@cbf: is there a release CR to reference?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 23:42:55 GMT):<br/>
@greg.haskins consider latest commit is the release CR. made IS_RELEASE=true in the previous commit assuming bumping nodejs version will go with that but that didn't go through 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 23:43:49 GMT):<br/>
in latest commit I have added couchdb change keeping IS_RELEASE=true..
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 23:43:58 GMT):<br/>
understood, but that isnt how I designed it nor recommend it to be used
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 23:44:38 GMT):<br/>
what I recommend is 1) a discrete commit that sets ONLY IS_RELEASE=true and a subsequent commit that unsets IS_RELEASE=true and bumps the version
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 23:44:43 GMT):<br/>
and then we target the tag at the first
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 23:45:16 GMT):<br/>
that way, you already know that the CI passes before the IS_RELEASE is set and you have one and only one commit that generates a release artifact
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 23:45:42 GMT):<br/>
if we have to, we can push it through as is, but I would recommend we just do it right
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 23:46:21 GMT):<br/>
its not a huge deal in this case, but I want to having ambiguity if there is a bisect
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 23:46:21 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 23:57:51 GMT):<br/>
Will continue as is otherwise we have to submit two CR's 1) make it "false" 2) release CR to make it "True"

Bug fix for Node SDK (both master and release):

<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 16:11:40 GMT):<br/>
Features for alpha are *locked down*.   Is then _ 1.1 alpha _  feature complete ?  No more features for 1.1 ?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:15:49 GMT):<br/>
@rickr That's correct.  If there items that are a gray area we can ask the maintainers for their opinion of whether it should go in, this is done by using a jira label of `review-needed`.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:22:44 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sat, 20 Jan 2018 10:04:47 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart  - one of those is the backport to the release branch.  We have just not pushed any patch releases for the Node SDK in a few cycles
(https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=CSppcTH6FcaFZMJFj) 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Sat, 20 Jan 2018 15:39:36 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart issue is with kafka version 0.9.0.1.. I think next steps are release one more version with kafka version 0.10.2.0.. Issues has been created for this and see Jason comments https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-7825
</p>

<p><strong>scottz</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 02:33:56 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu And then that will be picked up automatically by all the UT and the fabric-test daily jobs, which we will monitor closely. And we will need to make sure everyone gets the newer baseimage for future testing.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 22 Jan 2018 13:19:11 GMT):<br/>
yes @scottz once this patch (https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17041/) is merged, will request to create a release tag 0.4.5 and then update this patch https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17001/

Alpha release update
- Need to close out the bootstrap.sh discussion.  I think what @rameshthoomu  has in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17181/ is workable for alpha, but will likely need to change post-alpha.
- Upgrade doc will be pushed soon from @joe-alewine .  TLS doc is hopeful for later this afternoon, but we won’t necessarily wait for it.
- @wlahti  has just pushed a couple edits to the event example readme https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/16919/ . Please review/merge.
- Besides the above, we are in MERGE FREEZE for Fabric.
- A couple final SDK CRs coming in tonight.
- Can likely start cutting Fabric alpha tonight, and then finish out SDKs tomorrow.

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Sat, 27 Jan 2018 14:28:00 GMT):<br/>
@knagware9 Please see the release announcement above for feature detals.  "The alpha release includes all features and APIs that will be released with
1.1. ...  Hyperledger Fabric 1.1 will become Generally Available once the exit criteria is achieved (test coverage, defect arrivals, etc)."   Typically this takes a couple months, but may be quicker depending  on community assistance and findings.

Is anyone aware of any issues with the hosting site for the platform specific binaries for 1.1-alpha? http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/v1.1.0-alpha/samples.html#download-platform-specific-binaries . When I attempt the `curl` command it just sits and never seems to download. 
</p>
<p><strong>wlahti</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 17:25:12 GMT):<br/>
I'm able to download the 1.1.0-preview binaries but not the 1.1.0-alpha binaries
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 17:28:18 GMT):<br/>
I see the binaries are available for 1.1.0-alpha.. but it's taking time to download..

A few updates to share on the release:
- Release 1.1 is on target for Q1.
- We do not expect a 1.1 beta is required, as no significant updates since 1.1 alpha have been needed.
- We will proceed to 1.1 release candidate, once quality objectives are met.
- As such, I encourage everybody to try out v1.1.0-alpha and provide any feedback, either via this mailing list, JIRA ( https://jira.hyperledger.org/ ) or RocketChat ( https://chat.hyperledger.org/ ).
- The intent is to release quarterly going forward.
- Proposed themes for upcoming releases will be posted for community discussion. Stay tuned for details.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:54:37 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart @joe-alewine do we have documentation that is related for deployment?
Some random stackoverflow user that uses docker-swarm upgraded to v1.1 and his chaincode no longer instantiates because he needed to put:
CORE_PEER_CHAINCODEADDRESS=peer0.org1.example.com:7052
CORE_PEER_CHAINCODELISTENADDRESS=0.0.0.0:7052 
because of docker-swarm ip address resolution confuses the peer address detection logic in case of several interfaces.

Is there a place in the documentation that we can write such stuff so people could (hopefully) read and not make these innocent but frustrating mis-configurations  ? 
</p>
<p><strong>joe-alewine</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 17:03:17 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm @dave.enyeart Forgive my ignorance here but is this a shim issue? Because that's part of the upgrade/update documentation 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 17:03:30 GMT):<br/>
this is not an "issue"
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 17:04:02 GMT):<br/>
it's just that for v1.1, the chaincode server has more configuration combinations

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 17:04:02 GMT):<br/>

Would it be possible to tag in Docker a release alias that always is updated to the latest in the release, be it alpha, rc1, rc2, v1.1.0  etc  v1.1.1
something like v1.1-latest ?   SDKs and anyone that just wants the latest in 1.1 release stream could use that.

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 16 Feb 2018 15:09:10 GMT):<br/>
Ok, the former is merged.  The latter has merge conflict.  @rameshthoomu I thought we typically did those CRs on top of each other to ensure the dependency order.  Anyways, I think we prefer to tag the branch prior to merging the 'prepare for next' CR.
</p>

@nhrishi First of all it looks like your Experimental is false.  You need to set env variable EXPERIMENTAL=true.  That is the default in the Fabric Makefile.  I've tried master with and without experimental, and I get no import cycles.  Please try with latest master.

doc update will take some time.. having some trouble in building docs in RTD. `Whoa! The build queue is 477 tasks long, new builds may take a while. `

Tested  the following samples on `1.1.0-rc1` and all works well :)
- *first-network* with several combinations  (node.js chiancode, couchdb , couchdb indexing, custom channel name etc.,) 
  Also Update (*eyfn*) and upgrades using *upgrading tutorial*
- *fabcar* 
- *balance-transfer*

ANNOUNCING HYPERLEDGER FABRIC V1.1 - RELEASE CANDIDATE 1

@dave.enyeart why is there no published Node.js SDK for RC1? looks like there's a bunch of changes that have got in since the alpha... seems like it would be sensible to validate those before publishing the GA? https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/compare/v1.1.0-alpha...master
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 11:02:46 GMT):<br/>
there's also no published Node.js chaincode for RC1? again, more changes that should get validated: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-node/compare/v1.1.0-alpha...master

@sstone1 everything is oriented to pulling latest from NPM etc so you will get the latest stable images
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 13:37:55 GMT):<br/>
or modules as the case may be
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 13:39:11 GMT):<br/>
not sure i follow - for `fabric-client`, the tags are:

`'dist-tags': { latest: '1.0.4', unstable: '1.1.0-snapshot.83' }`

how do i target my node.js app to use the RC1 version of the `fabric-client` package?
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 13:42:27 GMT):<br/>
we want to update composer to use RC1 but at the moment we can only pull in the RC1 docker images for the peer/orderer/etc, we cannot get hold of the RC1 fabric-client or fabric-shim modules from npm so it's a weird mix of RC1 and alpha code
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 13:42:57 GMT):<br/>
`unstable` has the latest fixes since alpha
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 13:43:32 GMT):<br/>
why can't we have a nice rc1 tag?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 13:43:52 GMT):<br/>
some node projects do tags like that, some don't
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 13:44:28 GMT):<br/>
the samples all use `unstable` to get the latest
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 13:45:33 GMT):<br/>
for the sdks, there were some known fixes coming, so there isnt really a release candidate yet
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 13:45:55 GMT):<br/>
it's what you guys did for 1.0.0 ;)
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 13:46:00 GMT):<br/>
okay, maybe we should just hold out for those fixes
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 13:46:47 GMT):<br/>
please do tests with `unstable` lots of improvements since alpha
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 13:49:04 GMT):<br/>
will do!
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 14:25:36 GMT):<br/>
FWIW, I retagged the fabric-samples to pull in Keith's fix

@sstone1 rc1 fabric-ca-client binary is available here https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/releases/org/hyperledger/fabric-ca/hyperledger-fabric-ca/

use below commands to get the rc1 fabric-ca-client binary
```
export ARCH=$(echo "$(uname -s|tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'|sed 's/mingw64_nt.*/windows/')-$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/g')" | awk '{print tolower($0)}')
VERSION=1.1.0-rc1
curl https://nexus.hyperledger.org/content/repositories/releases/org/hyperledger/fabric-ca/hyperledger-fabric-ca/${ARCH}-${VERSION}/hyperledger-fabric-ca-${ARCH}-${VERSION}.tar.gz | tar xz
```
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 14:45:23 GMT):<br/>
cool, thanks @rameshthoomu !
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Sat, 03 Mar 2018 18:16:00 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart have picked up and integrated the latest fabric-shim (snapshot.12), fabric-ca-client (snapshot.83), and fabric-client (snapshot.85) - all looking good from a composer point of view :+1: 
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Sat, 03 Mar 2018 18:16:58 GMT):<br/>
had to track down a reproducible SIGSEGV when starting chaincode but it turned out that we had pinned grpc a while back, unpinning it and picking up the latest version fixed the problem... just FYI incase anyone else hits a similar problem

@aatkddny I had a successful run using couchdb as state DB. I confirmed this by checking the couchdb indexes. hence I don't see a problem.

Can you please confirm if you have used the command as following ? (make sure you pass the tag name with *option -i*  )
`./byfn.sh -m up -s couchdb -i 1.1.0-rc1`

That's a totally different problem. That's composer not waiting until something has finished before firing up a "depends_on" container. This is a new couchdb instance erroring out all over the place.

@rameshthoomu the fabric-ca-client binary is good for me - how can we get it added to the one line installer? i mean whatever runs when this command is executed: `curl -sSL https://goo.gl/6wtTN5 | bash -s 1.1.0-rc1`

it is in fabric-ca-client binary tar.. but @sstone1 is asking to include that in fabric bootstrap.sh script `curl -sSL https://goo.gl/6wtTN5 | bash -s 1.1.0-rc1`
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 14:09:52 GMT):<br/>
understood, and the curl script downloads a binaries tar and extracts it.  just confirming that's where fabric-ca-client will go
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 14:10:39 GMT):<br/>
so after the curl command is run, we'll see fabric-ca-client in the /bin directory
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 14:14:06 GMT):<br/>
let me test this
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 14:14:06 GMT):<br/>
yes we can see fabric-ca-client in bin dir...```(hyp) rameshs-mbp:bin thoomu@us.ibm.com$ ls
configtxgen		configtxlator		cryptogen		fabric-ca-client	get-docker-images.sh	orderer			peer
(```

@here we're seeing pretty good results from the 1.1.0-rc1 release, and so hopefully we can ship 1.1 later this week. I'll be pulling together a blog post for the Hyperledger blog and would love to reference some of the early adopters (e.g. projects that are planning to upgrade or have been in the process of upgrading from 1.0.x to 1.1.0. Please DM me and we can discuss how we get a quote

@rameshthoomu @cbf any chance we could get the https://goo.gl/6wtTN5 script updated so that it only grabs the binaries and doesn't do the `docker` parts if docker is not installed/available/desired? 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 14 Mar 2018 14:15:53 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=rSJY5v9HFBJhAa4Bi) @sstone1 why?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 14 Mar 2018 14:19:03 GMT):<br/>
I guess I am struggling with why we would want to support native orchestration of fabric when with Docker we have more control over what is running.
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Wed, 14 Mar 2018 15:00:16 GMT):<br/>
@cbf what if i want to use the fabric-ca-client or other binaries to connect to a fabric i've already stood up elsewhere? 
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Wed, 14 Mar 2018 15:00:48 GMT):<br/>
i _think_ the peer binary can be used to connect to a remote peer right?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 14 Mar 2018 19:08:27 GMT):<br/>
@sstone1 sure, it *can* but why not download the images? It isn't as if Docker is a novelty these days
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 14 Mar 2018 20:59:58 GMT):<br/>
I agree there should be an option for binary only for clients.  The script resides in master so it can be changed at anytime.  No need to rush something at the last minute for 1.1.  @sstone1 can you open a jira request please?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Wed, 14 Mar 2018 21:13:19 GMT):<br/>
We don't need to modify the script IMHO .... why not just point people to the folder which has the binary distributions?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 14 Mar 2018 22:39:48 GMT):<br/>
yeah we could do that

@dave.enyeart hello Dave. I've seen you completed the SideDB in 1.1. Is it still considered experimental or is it readily available in pre-built images?
</p>
<p><strong>fredbi</strong> (Mon, 19 Mar 2018 13:36:45 GMT):<br/>
some images tagged as 1.1.0 have not been released  yet on dockerHub:  fabric-couchdb, fabric-zookeeper, fabric-kafka
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 19 Mar 2018 14:07:23 GMT):<br/>
@fredbi couch, zookeeper & kafka images are published as third party images with version `0.4.6` image tag.. 
</p>
<p><strong>fredbi</strong> (Mon, 19 Mar 2018 14:12:15 GMT):<br/>
so far I've been used to single release tagging (e.g. 1.0.2, ... 1.0.6) 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Mon, 19 Mar 2018 14:20:33 GMT):<br/>
yes, this has been changed since 1.1 release.. see this one https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.1/scripts/bootstrap.sh
</p>
<p><strong>fredbi</strong> (Mon, 19 Mar 2018 14:21:51 GMT):<br/>
ok thank you - so far I've found convenient to tag all images with a single tag... now I use several ones... 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 19 Mar 2018 15:05:16 GMT):<br/>
@fredbi SideDB is experimental in 1.1.  Work is underway to make it a production feature in 1.2, you can track progress in this jira: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-8718
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 19 Mar 2018 15:05:16 GMT):<br/>
@fredbi SideDB is experimental in 1.1 and you must re-compile peer with EXPERIMENTAL=true to get it.  Work is underway to make it a production feature in 1.2, you can track progress in this jira: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-8718

<p><strong>davidkhala</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 02:07:45 GMT):<br/>
@fredbi I agree with you. It will be better for user experience and upgrade management that each type of image having aligned tag. 
</p>
<p><strong>davidkhala</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 02:12:33 GMT):<br/>
Developers starting from 1.0 might already have their own build script assuming tags are aligned. Thus it might be more work for them before migrate from 1.0 to 1.1.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=3MQinoksXM6Z9evu9) @dave.enyeart Dave, do we also have an experimental Fabric Node SDK (v1.1.0) compatible for SideDB features.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 27 Mar 2018 12:48:02 GMT):<br/>
@nhrishi No updates to SDK are required for SideDB.  All changes are on the chaincode side.  When calling chaincode you can pass private data in the transient field, and then in chaincode call the APIs for GetPrivateData(),PutPrivateData(), etc
</p>

does fabric have a plan to support Byzantium consensus in the further release?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 28 Mar 2018 11:36:44 GMT):<br/>
@bh4rtp Yes some groundwork is currently being developed, then BFT will be added using https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-33
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 28 Mar 2018 14:04:50 GMT):<br/>
@smithbk @aambati @skarim Saad was asking about getting approvals for FAB-7238.  This one is currently about 100th in a list of 134 items in the fabric-ca backlog.  I assume it should really be close to the top.  In order to make decisions about what goes into v1.2, I think we first need the fabric-ca team to clarify the backlog rankings.  Ranking 134 items is obviously difficult, minimally I'd suggest to rank the top 10 or so items, and then maintainers will be able look at the top items in each backlog and have discussion on relative priorities across components and epics.  While most of the focus in v1.2 timeframe will go towards the top priority epics, I expect a couple top priorities from each component will also need to go in. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 28 Mar 2018 14:06:20 GMT):<br/>
I'm posting this to fabric-release, as the same applies to each of the component backlogs. For a full list of component backlogs, see last page of https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qyYDY6yn8_unFKmxmUDtTs2tP6DHCf9QNE5Rh-w1FMQ/edit#heading=h.guz3k8svs8k8
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 28 Mar 2018 14:06:53 GMT):<br/>
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-7238 seems more like an Epic than a story.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 28 Mar 2018 14:07:26 GMT):<br/>
IMO, fabric-ca needs to choose 2-3 epics that will go into 1.2 release and manage from that
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 28 Mar 2018 14:08:44 GMT):<br/>
right, the fabric-ca backlog includes all types of items, the top epics/improvements/stories/features need to be highlighted

Because my production environment is generated based on the 1.0.0 version. In order to expand the organization, more than a dozen organizations were previously produced. However, only three organizations were actually used. Now that 1.1.0 can dynamically add organizations, the redundant organizations are useless. I am now trying to remove these redundant organizations. I now upgrade all nodes to version 1.1.0, but do not enable Capabilities, and then delete redundant organizations like adding organizations. Then turn on the Capabilities feature. Complete the 1.1.0 upgrade. Is this operation correct?

@duwenhui  - I assume you want to remove the orgs from the Consortium?  In any case, it should not matter which in which order you remove the orgs versus upgrading, but upgrading, removing the orgs and then enabling v1.1 capabilities will work just fine

<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 00:58:04 GMT):<br/>
why does the latest fabric remove `javaenv`?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 09:06:57 GMT):<br/>
it has its own repository @bh4rtp 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 09:49:03 GMT):<br/>
@bh4rtp  - as @yacovm mentions above, we have moved Java CC to its own repository and work is under way to actually support Java CC rather than having it as an experimental feature.  But that work is going to be a major refactor / rewrite so it does not make sense to keep around the current code in any case

@duwenhui The upgrade documentation http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upgrading_your_network_tutorial.html mentions to backup the orderers and peers before major changes.  If you make a mistake, you can then revert to the backup.

When upgrading 1.1, the upgrade is complete. However, several transactions were written without opening the Capabilities. Is there a problem?

Today's upgrade of the production environment encountered a more thorny problem: Orderer reported such errors when reading the system chain.

i think the docker images of fabric should take `$ARCH` as suffix of repository, not prefix of tag. for example `hyperledger/fabric-ccenv:amd64-1.2.0` as `hyperledger/fabric-ccenv-amd64:1.2.0`
</p>

@troyronda As we have shifted to quarterly releases with smaller incremental feature sets, there will be no alpha/beta/preview.

Let me shift the next question to the CI channel then.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 04 May 2018 13:57:41 GMT):<br/>
the goal is to keep master stable enough such that the community can consume it at any point and test things out
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 04 May 2018 13:58:27 GMT):<br/>
So your feeling is testing SDKs against docker latest is stable enough?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 04 May 2018 13:59:10 GMT):<br/>
(the question I was going to pose, is should there be periodic checkpoints available for testing SDKs against in the CI)

@troyronda  I know that @cbf and @rameshthoomu have been looking into making regular builds available, perhaps with some indication of which ones have had more testing.  I'll defer to them for an update...
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 04 May 2018 14:13:54 GMT):<br/>
thanks dave.

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 04 May 2018 14:42:10 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda yes... we are moving to a process where we anoint a nightly build as "stable" and making the images and binaries downloadable from Nexus
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 04 May 2018 14:42:29 GMT):<br/>
we could definitely use some assistance in making this so!

</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 04 May 2018 14:44:49 GMT):<br/>
we currently are at a point that the images are archived on Nexus... next we need to transition so that the nightly tests use a chosen set to test with (rather than a new build, which is currently the case)
</p>
<p><strong>bstasyszyn</strong> (Fri, 04 May 2018 14:58:36 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm @troyronda No we haven't tested endorsement queries yet.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 04 May 2018 14:59:04 GMT):<br/>
any ETA? :) 
</p>
<p><strong>bstasyszyn</strong> (Fri, 04 May 2018 15:00:12 GMT):<br/>
We'll need to look at our current backlog and prioritize - @troyronda?

@rameshthoomu how do these npm modules get published? manually or via automation? 
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 07:23:58 GMT):<br/>
in composer we publish the npm modules to a local npm server (verdaccio). our integration tests then install those npm modules, and run the tests against what was published + installed. that's instead of just running tests against the local source directory. it might avoid these kind of problems in the future if we did the same for all of the fabric npm modules.

@cbf Some parts of revocation were previously merged.  We are not merging code to expose it however.  If there are fixes to the prior merged code, I don't mind those fixes getting merged.  Looks like it has in fact been merged.
</p>
<p><strong>Maria</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 21:10:59 GMT):<br/>
@cbf this is not actual revocation - more like mock revocation with algorithm called NO_REVOCATION. It does allocate objects etc. but there is no actual non-revocation proof being generated/verified.... and no certificates being revoked with CRI being updated etc.

@cbf this is not actual revocation - more like mock revocation with the algorithm called NO_REVOCATION. It does allocate objects and updates protos etc. but there is no actual non-revocation proof being generated/verified.... and no certificates being revoked with CRI being updated etc. so in 1.3 when actual revocation algorithm is merged the previously issued certificates can still be revoked
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 21:18:28 GMT):<br/>
regardless of no revocation... i consider that a bug fix, because the essence of the change set is change the serializing of the signature. 
before the change set, the 2 parts of the signature were just glued together, and you can't figure out where the first part ends and the 2nd part starts... the fix makes it serialize in asn1 so that you have a separation between the fields.

@Maria Have a question I'd like answered for the Idemix JSDK work.  Is this API now something that we'll use in the future ?  I've heard from the team a strong desire to change it in a breaking manner  in the following release. 
</p>
<p><strong>Maria</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 13:34:09 GMT):<br/>
Hi Rick, @rickr , no we do not intend to break the entire SDK in 1.3. As you told us that we cannot change any of the JSDK interfaces now - so we implemented things how you proposed and interfaces are not breaking. However, as you suggested yourself, at some point you plan to change the JSDK interfaces (in 2.0 you said) - so we think that would be a good opportunity to also switch in treating SigningIdentity in the same way as in Fabric (the way we originally thought it could be implemented) which could lead to a few interface changes (but we would do it with a proper design review, in sync with other SDKs, etc.).
</p>

<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 13:36:52 GMT):<br/>
I think we were talking about 1.2 which I agree we can't break.  So the plan would be in a 2.0 release that most likely there would be breaking changes ?
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 13:51:14 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart @mastersingh24  @cbf I've heard _talk_ of a 2.0 release. Any notion how many releases away that might be?  I think the new chancode lifecycle might have changes that will be a significant hit on the SDKs and we probably won't be able to support both going to the same channel  at the same time.(not really a deprecated api)  that 2.0 for that would seem appropriate. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 13:54:19 GMT):<br/>
In my opinion we should bump up to 2.0 when the big lifecycle changes are made, and currently that is targeted for september release.
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 17:43:59 GMT):<br/>
Any thoughts will there be a 1.3 and then a 2.0  or just a 2.0 ?

We will merge defect fixes and important polish items for the next two weeks. Then in mid-June cut a RC1 and release to community, and create a release-1.2 branch. Then the last two weeks of June only critical fixes could get into release-1.2 branch for the final v1.2 release cut. System test will proceed all throughout June. Of course, as we progress through each week of June we will get more and more critical of which CRs to merge. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 14:22:04 GMT):<br/>
We are still targeting v1.2 RC1 for the week of June 18th, although it will depend on defect and system test progress.

Hi guys do you know when would be available the instantiation of chaincodes fully integrated within kubernetes? I read that its planned to be available at 1.2?

@vanitas92 this requires deeper changes, and is not planned for 1.2. There is keen interest from within the community. Suggest you follow-up on the #fabric-kubernetes channel.

Hi everybody, just wondering when will be the 1.1.1 / 1.2 release available - just asking because 1.1 is based on Go 1.9.2 right now and you know there is the security bug in there
</p>
<p><strong>david_dornseifer</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 06:44:20 GMT):<br/>
Or is there no 1.1.1 release planned and it will directly be 1.2? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 06:48:41 GMT):<br/>
what bug, @david_dornseifer  ? 
</p>
<p><strong>david_dornseifer</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 06:49:42 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-14185/product_id-29205/version_id-238294/Golang-GO-1.9.2.html its cve 7.5
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 06:50:19 GMT):<br/>
oh but we don't do `go get` IIRC
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 06:50:24 GMT):<br/>
in the peer/orderer
</p>
<p><strong>david_dornseifer</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 06:52:47 GMT):<br/>
hmm ok - just wondering is there a minor release planned soon? Also the kafka / zk and couchd images - they are still on 1.1-preview? 
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 06:54:41 GMT):<br/>
we always patch v1.1.x
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 06:54:55 GMT):<br/>
there were multiple releases already introduced for v1.1.x
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 06:55:03 GMT):<br/>
but v1.2 is right at the door
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 06:55:13 GMT):<br/>
so you should wait for it
</p>
<p><strong>david_dornseifer</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 06:55:38 GMT):<br/>
:+1:  what is your estimate - how long will it take till 1.2 is available? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 06:56:03 GMT):<br/>
I'd say end of this month 
</p>
<p><strong>david_dornseifer</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 07:06:37 GMT):<br/>
ok thx for that information - so there will definitely not be a minor release 1.1.1?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 07:07:16 GMT):<br/>
there will probably be more v1.1.x releases
</p>
<p><strong>david_dornseifer</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 07:23:07 GMT):<br/>
ok, would be nice if Go1.10 would be shipped with 1.1.1 
</p>
<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 07:32:19 GMT):<br/>
i think you can update go1.10 by yourself if required. @david_dornseifer

Hi guys i have a question about images of zookeeper, kafka and couchdb, they do not have a 1.1 version but the newer images are tagged as 0.4.x. Could somebody clarify this? 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 21:18:40 GMT):<br/>
@vanitas92 from release-1.1, we are tagging thirdparty images (kafka, zookeeper and couchdb) with baseimage release version. So you see thirdparty image versions like 0.4.x.. So the latest compatible thirdparty version for release-1.1 is 0.4.6 (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.1/Makefile#L47)

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:36:03 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu @cbf Last night I merged and tagged baseimage 0.4.9.  We got all three architecture docker images pushed to dockerhub for baseimage.  But the third party images only got pushed for ppc64le-0.4.9 and s390x-0.4.9, not for amd64-0.4.9.  Can you take a look?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:36:50 GMT):<br/>
On my local, amd64-0.4.9 did indeed get built successfully and tests successfully
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:37:52 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart help me understand why 0.4.9 is being produced? What's in it?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:38:30 GMT):<br/>
updates to latest recommended node js, and some fixes to couchdb image that got reverted in prior baseimages
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:39:40 GMT):<br/>
ah ok, I was looking at an older version that had no changes;-)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:40:12 GMT):<br/>
but help me understand the testing strategy here... we are swapping out the baseimage just before we release rc1?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:41:14 GMT):<br/>
I thought near the end of each release, the process was to release a baseimage to scoop up the changes and get on the latest dependencies.  System test has several weeks ahead still.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:42:15 GMT):<br/>
it would be my preference that we have a couple weeks under our belt with a new baseimage
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:42:43 GMT):<br/>
It would be fine to keep v1.2 on 0.4.8.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:42:58 GMT):<br/>
I guess if we get clean builds we can take the chance... I understand that we've already internalized the node upgrade
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:43:02 GMT):<br/>
We can move to 0.4.9 in v1.3.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:43:10 GMT):<br/>
that would be my preference
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:44:14 GMT):<br/>
ok, let's do that

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:46:22 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu would still like you to see what happened with amd64 third party images
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:47:05 GMT):<br/>
agree, once sorted I can run the multiarch
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:50:58 GMT):<br/>
I just re-triggered the  amd64 thirdparty build job.. 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:51:50 GMT):<br/>
last time it failed here `manifest for hyperledger/fabric-baseimage:amd64-0.4.9 not found`
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:52:25 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu are you running the multiarch?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:52:29 GMT):<br/>
as part of the release?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:52:30 GMT):<br/>
no
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:52:38 GMT):<br/>
hmmm
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:52:47 GMT):<br/>
for now that's a manual task
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:52:54 GMT):<br/>
thought so
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:53:02 GMT):<br/>
the error above is odd though
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:53:16 GMT):<br/>
guess it means that there is no such image in nexus?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:55:32 GMT):<br/>
yes that failure happend at a race condition.. to build thirdparty images, it's actually looking for the released baseimage version as the x86_64 build nodes are slow, it failed to build thirdparty build..
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:56:08 GMT):<br/>
k
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 11:59:53 GMT):<br/>
@cbf you can proceed with multiarch now.. We have all the images available in dockerhub
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 14:35:46 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart for the 1.3 release you will need to review the version of node.js in the base image again and probably update it. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 14:37:28 GMT):<br/>
@davidkel node.js version was recently updated and included in 0.4.9.  But @cbf and I decided it was not worth the risk to update fabric to 0.4.9. If there is a specific concern with the prior version of node.js we can re-evaluate.

<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 14:39:41 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart My feeling is that fabric should track the LTS versions of node and always deliver the latest LTS version as possible of node 8 to ensure it is current with bug and security fixes. In the future a more difficult decision will be when to move to the next LTS version of node which will be node v10 due to go LTS before the end of this year, but 8 will stay in LTS for a bit longer

I was trying to rerun one of the manual test (i.e., data consistency check by adding a new peer -- https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/22583/) using the master branch. Now, I get the following error `error starting container: error starting container: Failed to generate platform-specific docker build: Failed to pull hyperledger/fabric-ccenv:amd64-1.2.0: API error (404): manifest for hyperledger/fabric-ccenv:amd64-1.2.0 not found"` 

`docker images` shows  `hyperledger/fabric-ccenv` with tag `amd64-1.2.0-snapshot-fcb7b26`. As per the above error message, it is expecting the ccenv image with tag `amd64-1.2.0`. For now, I need to retag the image and try. 

Can someone look at this error?

To paste what was announced in #fabric-scrum ...
fabric v1.2.0-rc1 has been cut, pushed to dockerhub, and tagged.
fabric release branch release-1.2 has been created. release-1.2 branch will be used for any critical defects found in rc1 and targeted for the upcoming v1.2.0 release.
master branch can be used for new v1.3 development. Merge freeze lifted, go and use master as usual.
fabric-ca v1.2.0-rc1 is in final verification, will be pushed to dockerhub shortly.
fabric-ca is still in MERGE FREEZE

Hi, is there a way to figure out what image / tag on dockerhub is based on what commit - e.g. the 1.1 images on dockerhub are about a month old but the latest patch to the 1.1 release has been committed about five days ago

Just as an FYI: If you follow the instructions on the mailing list to install it takes you to the regular "use this script to install" page.
Doing the usual cut-n-paste into a terminal gives this though:

```
Error response from daemon: manifest for hyperledger/fabric-javaenv:1.2.0-rc1 not found
Error response from daemon: No such image: hyperledger/fabric-javaenv:1.2.0-rc1
```

```
===> Checking out v1.2.0-rc1 branch of hyperledger/fabric-samples
error: pathspec 'v1.2.0-rc1' did not match any file(s) known to git.

Or for that matter the binaries.

@aatkddny Since there is no support for java chaincode that error is benign, we are trying to suppress it for the actual v1.2.0 release
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 13:06:15 GMT):<br/>
k. thx.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 13:09:36 GMT):<br/>
@cbf What was the intent of -s?  If I leave it off I get an error...
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 13:11:37 GMT):<br/>
suppress samples
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 13:12:07 GMT):<br/>
ergo counterintuitive.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 13:15:35 GMT):<br/>
-s omits the cloning of the samples repo
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 13:15:44 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart ^^
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 13:16:45 GMT):<br/>
not sure if it is counter=intuitive. If I already have them, why would I clone them again?
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 13:25:03 GMT):<br/>
well there are a few changes in 1.2 that i'd hope to see samples for. you know, little things like private data....
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 13:26:15 GMT):<br/>
@cbf from my trial... with -s I get the samples.  if I omit -s, then I get an error:
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 13:26:18 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 13:27:14 GMT):<br/>
wrong omission
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 13:27:50 GMT):<br/>
you need the -s to pass the argument
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 13:28:24 GMT):<br/>
if you want to curl and omit the samples curl ... | bash -s 1.2.0-rc1 -s
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 13:29:01 GMT):<br/>
ah right... maybe that's why it is counter-intuitive, we could use some more info on the doc page
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 13:29:18 GMT):<br/>
@aatkddny then cd fabric-samples && git checkout release-1.2 && git pull
</p>
<p><strong>aatkddny</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 13:50:40 GMT):<br/>
sigh. i know i can do that, but you blithely inserted this into the mainline documentation. go look at the paragraph right above your edit then ask yourself whether that will cause any confusion. a simple one line that says "samples are suppressed until xxx" that can be removed when this goes GA is going to remove the WTF that everyone trying to use this goes through when it doesn't do what it says it is doing.

Hi, Quick question, I see docker images are with tag 1.2.0-rc1 on docker hub. Typically, we have platform specific images (e.g. x86_64-1.1.0).  Isn't that the case this time?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 11:23:56 GMT):<br/>
@nhrishi rc1 images supports multi arch .. so you will see latest, 1.2.0-rc1 and platform specific images on docker hub...  
</p>
<p><strong>nhrishi</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 12:11:12 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=Nl013GyoAOzuNsCpac) @rameshthoomu Ok sure. Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>pd93</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 13:33:38 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu Any advantage to using a platform specific image over a multi-arch image? 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 13:35:02 GMT):<br/>
@pd93 what you mean multi-arch image?
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 13:37:06 GMT):<br/>
ex; `hyperledger/fabric-peer:latest` image is compatible for both x and z platforms...  
</p>
<p><strong>pd93</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 13:38:00 GMT):<br/>
@rameshthoomu Is there an advantage/difference to running `amd64-1.2.0-rc1` rather than `1.2.0-rc1` if I know my target platform arch is `amd64`.
Basically, I'm wondering why we still need platform specific images if the multi-arch image can be used everywhere.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 13:38:27 GMT):<br/>
both are same... 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 13:40:12 GMT):<br/>
We have to publish arch based images to docker registry first before run multi-arch script
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 14:01:38 GMT):<br/>
@pd93 the multiarch manifests record both but the docker command will pull only the relevant one for your platform
</p>
<p><strong>pd93</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 14:02:59 GMT):<br/>
Okay cool, thanks both :)

All - We are preparing to release v1.2.0.  As part of that we are going to update baseimage to 0.4.10 (to pick up debian stretch for s390x), and then increment fabric and fabric-ca to utilize baseimage 0.4.10.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:37:36 GMT):<br/>

are we going to omit the fabric-ca images?

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:41:14 GMT):<br/>
what do you mean omit?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:41:16 GMT):<br/>
but I won't have time this morning to work on that
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:41:28 GMT):<br/>
as @mastersingh24 suggested 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:41:54 GMT):<br/>
eg not publish them
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:42:26 GMT):<br/>
i think we should be consistent with what we've done for 1.1.0 and 1.2.0-rc1
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:42:36 GMT):<br/>
make changes in v1.3
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:42:55 GMT):<br/>
So I'm still not sure why we are changing baseimage to use debian:stretch at this late date?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:43:20 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart  - but being consistently bad is not a good thing  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:43:42 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 basically, as a result of removing lts for jessie for s390x the packages are no longer available
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:43:44 GMT):<br/>
i guess i don't understand the proposal of what you want to change for v1.2.0
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:44:02 GMT):<br/>
stop publishing the stupid fabric-ca + fabric images
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:44:21 GMT):<br/>
the fabric-ca sample instructions uses them
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:44:25 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart doing this would remove the serialization dependency between fabric and fabric-ca
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:44:43 GMT):<br/>
it's a crappy sample anyway .... but easily updated to tell people how to build the images
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:45:15 GMT):<br/>
i created a jira for that - https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-10930  - but thought it was a v1.3 task to re-work the sample instructions
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:45:44 GMT):<br/>
just more baggage for us to carry .... but I'm fine with minimizing the impact on 1.2
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:46:04 GMT):<br/>
I'm still not sure why we are moving to Stretch and getting rid of the baseimage changes
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:46:49 GMT):<br/>
because debian stretch was blocking s390x, which some people are interested in
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:46:49 GMT):<br/>
because debian jessie was blocking s390x, which some people are interested in
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:47:22 GMT):<br/>
and we thought it would be better to be consistent across x86 and s390x releases, rather than do one-offs for each
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:48:37 GMT):<br/>
or adding more change at this point to the release
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:48:41 GMT):<br/>
```
apt-get update
apt-get -y install softhsm2
```
in testenv is making us do a last minute update?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:48:43 GMT):<br/>
all testing has been on baseimage 0.4.8, so we reverted some recent baseimage changes to make 0.4.10 look just like 0.4.8, except with the new debian stretch
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:49:05 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 also blocking sdk-go, sdk-chaincode-node, sdk-node s390x builds and I see people are complaining about it and asking for an update
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:49:24 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 even in tools image
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:49:37 GMT):<br/>
own goal
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:49:40 GMT):<br/>
There's something wrong then with the way we are building things
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:49:53 GMT):<br/>
yes, and we are fixing that for 1.3;-)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:52:53 GMT):<br/>
I suppose we are ok given debian:stretch is equivalent to ubuntu:xenial
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:53:25 GMT):<br/>
But I'm not sure why we are reverting all of the other changes we made
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:53:45 GMT):<br/>
seems orthogonal to me
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:54:02 GMT):<br/>
because the couchdb and node js updates havent been well tested
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:54:16 GMT):<br/>
no tested fabric has used those updates
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:54:32 GMT):<br/>
if we had some more days before release, we would have kept them
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:54:46 GMT):<br/>
That is NOT true .... we added the Node.js update specifically because they said they had tested with them
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:54:58 GMT):<br/>
You mean system test?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:55:02 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:55:09 GMT):<br/>
I seriously give up
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:56:05 GMT):<br/>
And the couch changes make sense to me ..... I don't see how they make any different in testing
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:56:05 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:56:18 GMT):<br/>
And the Node chaincode guys have been running tests with the update
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:56:31 GMT):<br/>
i created baseimage 0.4.9 June 19th  to move up to these changes, but that was rejected
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:57:43 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:57:43 GMT):<br/>
ok, merging the baseimage CRs now
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:58:12 GMT):<br/>
Gari, had we started June 1 would have been different... I am tired of us making changes this late in the cycle
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:58:16 GMT):<br/>
I'm going to change all of this crap for 1.3 then ..... this is shitty

;)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:58:44 GMT):<br/>
No one maintains the baseimage .... so it needs to go
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:59:01 GMT):<br/>
OK ... as long as we can change this stupid way things are built for 1.3 I'm ok
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:59:11 GMT):<br/>
buildenv, testenv, bsenv  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 04:59:14 GMT):<br/>
yes, I was *this* close to just cutting s390x images instead of adopting stretch
</p>

when i updating a Channel Configuration use java sdk, the BatchTimeout:timeout can be updated success and valid; but when i update BatchSize:max_message_count, also can be updated success,but not go into effect
example, begin the BatchSize:max_message_count = 10, and update it to 30, now the channel config is 30, but the block max message count is still 10
when i restart the orderer node , the new max_message_count=30 is valid
so update channel config for the BatchSize:max_message_count is a bug?

@cbf the node modules should be tagged as 1.2 (ie not have a -snapshot value after) and then latest can reference that version. Only the unstable tag should reference a snapshot version. Currently for some odd reason latest points to 1.0.8

<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Thu, 05 Jul 2018 12:03:00 GMT):<br/>
+1 on what dave said, we should really be publishing proper releases across all of the SDKs as well as the core components
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Thu, 05 Jul 2018 12:03:06 GMT):<br/>
FYI fabric-shim points to   'dist-tags': { latest: '1.1.2', unstable: '1.2.0-snapshot.4' },

</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Thu, 05 Jul 2018 12:03:40 GMT):<br/>
`latest` is just an alias and you don't really want an alias to a `snapshot` version as npm will end up embedding the snapshot version into your package.json
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Thu, 05 Jul 2018 12:04:42 GMT):<br/>
it's also a bit confusing - going by the latest published versions, i want 1.2.0 of the peer, 1.2.0-snapshot.79 of the client SDK, 1.2.0-snapshot.4 of the shim

@mastersingh24 @IgorSim that begs the question: why not? a naive follow-up would be: since 2.0 will come out before long (5 years) support would end?

<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Sun, 08 Jul 2018 19:15:06 GMT):<br/>
@cbf @mastersingh24 thanks for publishing the npm modules for 1.2.0! can we update the release process so that whenever a new version of fabric is published, we also publish the npm modules?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Sun, 08 Jul 2018 21:38:31 GMT):<br/>
@greg2git  - a few reasons:

1) We have *yet* to determine our overall LTS strategy in terms of of how long we'll support LTS versions ... most certainly it will not be 5 years tho

2) It is still way too early in terms of features / functionality and the overall market to actually declare LTS for anything we've published to date

I was wondering what the process was for being able to release a new version of the node-sdk (for example a 1.2.1 release). I guess the first step is to set the package.json to 1.2.1 then tag that particular revision. Does tagging require special permission and if so who has that ability ?

Right now JSDK docker compose I have 
```
ccenv:
    image: hyperledger/fabric-ccenv${IMAGE_TAG_FABRIC}
```
I _think_ this handles both the Golang and Node chaincode as both seem work.  What is/will be needed for Java chaincode to work ?  @gennadyl  @dave.enyeart   
I want people who try the JSDK to just start up  it's docker-compose have all three supported chaincodes available.

You don't need ccenv in docker compose, even for go chaincode

right nothing you said is new there
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 16:55:34 GMT):<br/>
If you look again @dave.enyeart  I'm asking what will I need for java chaincode !
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 16:56:10 GMT):<br/>
Ok so will I need nothing for java ?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 16:57:49 GMT):<br/>
I believe you just need hyperledger/fabric-javaenv image available... you can either build that or pull it from nexus
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 16:58:50 GMT):<br/>
to build, you have to use `./gradlew buildImage` from fabric-chaincode-java root directory
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 16:59:09 GMT):<br/>
Ok -- that would be a start.  Can someone give me a `snippet` I can put in my docker compose to have it working ?
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 16:59:49 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart  yes I know I've done that -- I don't want user's to have to do that 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 17:02:02 GMT):<br/>
And if we do pull it from Nexus is that where we plan to have for the  release .. or is that just a _temporary_ place until the release 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 17:05:18 GMT):<br/>
as we wouldn't expect most people to have fabric-chaincode-java environment, the recommendation would be to pull from dockerhub (for regular releases) or nexus (while developing a release)
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 17:06:58 GMT):<br/>
ok  so drum role please ::  give me what I can use now   I publish SNAPSHOT images and if user get the sdk I would like it work 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 17:08:39 GMT):<br/>
I'd have to defer that question to @rameshthoomu , he added the nexus pull in CI.  I suspect regular users could do something similar.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 17:10:46 GMT):<br/>
@rickr I think it's better to alter docker-compose file to pull javenv image from nexus instead from hyperledger dockerhub https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/blob/master/src/test/fixture/sdkintegration/docker-compose.yaml#L176
</p>

nexus3.hyperledger.org:10001/fabric-javaenv${IMAGE_TAG_FABRIC_JAVAENV}
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 17:13:22 GMT):<br/>
why does ccenv (or javaenv) need to be in docker-compose at all?  it's not in the byfn docker compose.
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 17:14:07 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart  yes -- I just removed that and confirmed I don't need that for Node or GO chaincode to run
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 17:14:45 GMT):<br/>
Which to be frank is news to me 
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 17:15:35 GMT):<br/>
So I'd be very happy even for now I could have a snippet of docker compose that would pull it from anywhere .. even if I need to update it after the release 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 17:15:45 GMT):<br/>
docker compose doesn't start a ccenv container.   the peer implicitly uses the image
</p>
<p><strong>rickr</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 17:16:10 GMT):<br/>
IMO Java _should_ be no different 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 17:16:15 GMT):<br/>
agreed
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 17:16:22 GMT):<br/>
you just need to have the image local
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 17:16:33 GMT):<br/>
prior to starting the docker compose network
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 17:18:11 GMT):<br/>
refer this https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/25900/3/jjb/fabric-sdk-java/shell/include-raw-fabric-sdk-java-end-to-end-tests.sh@56
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 09:26:24 GMT):<br/>
Difference between java and rest chaincodes that java uses iavaenv image instead ccenv image. javaenv image should not be local, once it in docker hub, it will be pulled automatically, same way as ccenv image pulled. Another difference that as runtime java uses same javaenv images as well. Java chaincode uses chaincode.java.runtime image both for build and runtime.
</p>
<p><strong>gennadyl</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 09:28:34 GMT):<br/>
@rickr You don't need to pull manually any of ccenv or javaenv images (for java it will become true once image published on docker hub). The only reason to do this is to improve performance.

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 10:28:36 GMT):<br/>
The former allows you to set endorsement policy at the key (asset) level rather than at the chaincode level, for example the endorsement policy may follow from the current ownership. For more details see https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-8812, especially see the attached PDF. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 10:28:38 GMT):<br/>
The latter means some of the Composer functionality is being pushed down to Fabric itself, for details see https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-11246
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 10:29:24 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 16:25:03 GMT):<br/>
@bh4rtp, I am not sure what you mean by good frontend solution. The web3 support will only work for those use contracts that can be compiled into bytecode. So in those situations we expect people will use web3 to create their frontends, as this is what I have understood as one of the main tools ethereum developers use. How we are doing this is by implementing a limited set of the ethereum json rpc apis, which means the support isn't necessarily specific to web3. 
</p>
<p><strong>bh4rtp</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 00:14:05 GMT):<br/>
@swetha thanks. web3 and solidity are excellent for ethereum. i think fabric is landing. :grinning:

Any words on the release of BFT consensus for 1.4? Will that be guaranteed? Namely, what's the new architecture of BFT and how will that be an improvement from v0.6's BFT?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 19:38:11 GMT):<br/>
@cbf I discussed with @rameshthoomu , it seems there is still a need for a release CR on release day, in order to update bootstrap.sh , CHANGELOG.md , install.rst , releases.rst.  As we don't want these updated with final values until release day. 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 19:38:18 GMT):<br/>
But none of these impact test results, so we can indeed do all final system testing on the daily binaries/images until we have one we like.  It's just not as simple as 'pick any and promote', as we had hoped.

@raviyelleni we're looking at release candidate of v1.3 next week, and final GA release the following week.  Content can be seen in the dashboard (top-left widget): https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10701

jira marked as 1.3
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 18:28:34 GMT):<br/>
this looks relevant
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 18:31:29 GMT):<br/>
haven't freed up to test it enough before baseimage cut-off, i've commented as such and moved to v1.4
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 18:34:46 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 18:35:37 GMT):<br/>
was wondering if it was important to SK since they reviewed it
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 18:40:06 GMT):<br/>
it has not been raised as a priority, as far as i know
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 18:48:09 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 18:48:24 GMT):<br/>
I moved the remaining JIRAs for BI to 1.4
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 18:48:35 GMT):<br/>
that is, the ones that have CRs
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 18:48:57 GMT):<br/>
odd that we track the fabric release for BI
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 18:48:59 GMT):<br/>
but whatever
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 19:19:47 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart  @mastersingh24 we are getting rid of the fabric-ca-(peer, orderer, tools) in 1.3, correct?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 19:20:26 GMT):<br/>
I've submitted the CR for the samples and test, going to submit the CA change next
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 19:30:04 GMT):<br/>
that is the intent
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 19:30:36 GMT):<br/>
it sounds like there are still some open questions though, per the thread in https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABC-131
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 19:36:04 GMT):<br/>
I removed the dependency in fabric-samples and fabric-test

@dave.enyeart I've reviewed the release process doc and made some updates... I'll need @rameshthoomu to give it a look as well, as some of the manual jenkins processes are not in my repertoire 
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 21:00:22 GMT):<br/>
@cbf I am working on updating the doc with the latest changes.. It's almost done.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 21:01:17 GMT):<br/>
I am not modifying the versions specified already in the doc ex: 0.4.6 baseimage or the version's 1.2.0 etc..
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 21:02:04 GMT):<br/>

fabric, fabric-ca, fabric-chaincode-java v1.3.0-rc1 have been released.
release-1.3 branch has been created for each for any critical bugs that are found over the next week.
master branch is re-opened for v1.4 development.
Caveat - please don't merge into fabric-ca yet. e2e tests from the SDKs are still failing there due to java chaincode issues we've been having, related to syncing across the repositories and branches for 1.3.0-SNAPSHOT, 1.3.0-rc1, 1.3.0, and 1.4.0.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 26 Sep 2018 05:40:39 GMT):<br/>

@dave.enyeart @rameshthoomu done for 1.2.1 - for javaenv there is no s390x image
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 14:54:41 GMT):<br/>
is that intentional?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 14:54:49 GMT):<br/>
(for 1.3.0-rc1)
</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 15:06:02 GMT):<br/>
yes.. @gennadyl created a FAB to work on this.. 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 15:07:47 GMT):<br/>
ok so you want me to create multiarch for just the amd64 image?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 15:10:06 GMT):<br/>
yes, so that the scripts work
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 15:10:21 GMT):<br/>
ok, so I published the multiarch for just amd64 of javaenv
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 15:10:41 GMT):<br/>
will create a JIRA to build off of the one Gennady opened to publish the s390x
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 15:11:10 GMT):<br/>
does not make sense to add to fabric multiarch.sh script
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 15:24:38 GMT):<br/>
I thought that it was only a 1.3 thing
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 15:30:20 GMT):<br/>
it was available in v1.1.x as experimental but didn't go well...making it's re-debut in v1.3.0

@dave.enyeart   Have all the JIRA's for the SDKs been created for known work items to be delivered for 1.4 ? 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 15:02:13 GMT):<br/>
@rickr For the work items I am most familiar with in v1.4, I don't know of SDK impacts. v1.4 is not intended to be a feature-heavy release.  That being said, we've requested all components including SDKs to think about their top priority hygiene and serviceability items that can be done in v1.4 timeframe.  For SDKs, part of that would be having application samples that demonstrate good practices. Go ahead and open Jira items with your thoughts.

<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 17:47:39 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 18:26:18 GMT):<br/>
I did make a suggestion. Given the chaincode tests depend on the base images and other things, it's best to make sure you've got the right levels.
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 18:27:13 GMT):<br/>
Roger, thanks for the suggestion. Fairly certain I cleaned all, but I will give it one more go. Will update shortly.

@kostas I assume a good idea to figure out where tests are getting stuck is to `kill -SIGABRT` the test process of the package after enough time, and then look for the goroutine of the test, to figure out in what line in the test it is stuck in.

@kostas I'm doing a start from scratch build locally as well. Removing all containers and images, clearing any caches, and building with `make`.  (`make clean-all && docker system prune -a && make`)

I'm running `make checks` and it's failing in the unit tests phase. All packages are checked, but the chaincode one fails:
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 19:28:48 GMT):<br/>

Let me also do that.
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 19:29:28 GMT):<br/>
`checks` just runs the linter, unit tests, and integration tests. It's the unit tests that are failing.
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 19:29:57 GMT):<br/>
it should give you a lot more info than just timing out - unless you're running out of memory (ask me how I know)
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 19:31:00 GMT):<br/>
ACK. Will have more helpful output in a few. Thanks for the pointers.
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 20:38:20 GMT):<br/>
So, that's fascinating -- at least for my ignorant eyes.
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 20:38:29 GMT):<br/>
`make unit-test` works w/o issues.
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 20:38:41 GMT):<br/>
As does `TEST_PKGS=github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/... make unit-test`
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 20:39:13 GMT):<br/>
The only one that fails is `make checks`. This is a dump of everything I get: https://gist.github.com/kchristidis/aca3d2b7d351668187e56361dd5b3669

Bumping the Docker host's memory to 4GB (from my current 2GB), per @sykesm's advice, made it work. /fyi @cbf

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 15:23:03 GMT):<br/>
I've tried increasing to 4G and it still fails, though takes less time doing so (~5 mins)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 15:23:41 GMT):<br/>
@sykesm @kostas - maybe we should modify so that race detection is opt-in?
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 15:24:38 GMT):<br/>
I would oppose that. I have already fixed dozens of concurrency issues that have been flagged with the race detector. People need to be aware of concurrency issues and address them as they write code.
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 15:25:18 GMT):<br/>
Enabling race in our test builds has been an ongoing effort since early this year.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 15:39:08 GMT):<br/>
I'm up to 6G and it still fails
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 15:39:42 GMT):<br/>
though the time to fail is continuing to fall - now at < 4 mins
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 15:50:00 GMT):<br/>
FWIW, I disabled race detection and it still fails, though within 2 minutes now
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 15:50:07 GMT):<br/>
@sykesm 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 15:55:16 GMT):<br/>
one thing is certain - if we make race detector opt-in and not mandatory - soon enough we'll be swarmed by races again :) 
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 16:05:12 GMT):<br/>
@cbf it doesn't sound like memory (or the race detector) are the source of the problems you're having.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 16:26:20 GMT):<br/>
indeed, but it is still failing in the chaincode package
</p>
<p><strong>sykesm</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 17:02:10 GMT):<br/>
@cbf, I'm happy to try and help but will need more to go on. Are you running in a VM? Docker for X? If you run the package in isolation does it work?
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 15:26:22 GMT):<br/>
by precedent we would switch it back to 'true', but i agree with you, can keep it 'false' for now and then open a CR to remove it in both release and master branches

Will fabric-ca images be added to docker hub at some point, or from now we have to build them "by hand"?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 10:47:51 GMT):<br/>
@gatakka  - we only intend to publish https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/fabric-ca/ from now on

v1.4 on ubuntu requires xenial 18 and go 1.11, correct?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 12:06:41 GMT):<br/>
v1.4 / master is currently using Go 1.11.1  .... we don't really have a prereq on the OS .. although Ubuntu Xenial or later and Debian Stretch or later are typically what people are using

hi, does the version 1.3 ZKP feature cover the Private Asset Transfer capability too or it's limited to providing Anonymous Client Authentication?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 26 Oct 2018 10:32:24 GMT):<br/>
v1.3 has Anonymous Client Authentication. Private Asset Transfer is expected for a future release.

<p><strong>githubcpc</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 01:52:28 GMT):<br/>
If I want to upgrade 1.1 to 1.3 ,I must upgrade to 1.2 according this documents?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 02:10:15 GMT):<br/>
there are detailed instructions for 1.1 to 1.2 and then 1.2 to 1.3.  if you try to do it in a single hop you would have to merge the instructions on your own, use caution.
</p>
<p><strong>githubcpc</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 02:14:29 GMT):<br/>
OK.I will update  to 1.2 first .Thanks.

<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 20:46:01 GMT):<br/>
The culprit was a leftover `build` directory in the project's root. It was importing `github.com/Sirupsen/logrus` and that was messing up the dep solver.

2) Update `SOFTHSM2_CONF` via  `export =$HOME/lib/softhsm/softhsm2.conf` 
3) make unit-test this should work now.

Hi, one quick question, what is the latest release of fabric binaries?

Because i have downloaded for 1.3.0 configtxgen --version shows me 1.2.0
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 24 Dec 2018 13:44:31 GMT):<br/>
@akshay.lawange  latest release is 1.3.0.  there is also a 1.4.0-rc2 (release candidate 2).
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 24 Dec 2018 13:44:55 GMT):<br/>
I have a configtxgen downloaded for 1.3.0 and it's binary shows correct version:
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 24 Dec 2018 13:44:58 GMT):<br/>
```$ ./configtxgen --version

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=iQFKsNMfXvDG5WnDE) @dave.enyeart Thanks. So for fabric v1.3.0, is 1.2.0 binary compatible?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 24 Dec 2018 14:33:25 GMT):<br/>
Back versions of SDK clients are tested for backwards compatibility so that client applications do not break, other tools are not (use back versions at your own risk).

Hello everyone, is there any schedule for 2.0 release? We were waiting for raft implementation, and we'd like to know if there is some sort of release schedule for 2.0 which will supposedly include raft implementation.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Mon, 31 Dec 2018 10:05:50 GMT):<br/>
@puilp0502  - we have been putting out quarterly releases (1.4.0 will ship in early Jan due to the holiday).  So the next release is expected at the end of March.  Ideally it will include Raft

maybe this has been answered many times already, but i've always wondered, why 2.0 instead of 1.5? breaking api?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 07 Jan 2019 15:41:37 GMT):<br/>
@guoger Calling it 2.0 due to major changes to lifecycle, new raft-based ordering service with some different assumptions, and SDKs are evaluating whether APIs need to change/break.

@JayJong v1.4.0 includes fixes since v1.3.0 timeframe and is the long-term support release. Therefore we don't expect a v1.3.1 at this time. As the LTS release, there will be a series of v1.4.x releases throughout the year. Currently targeting end of March for v1.4.1.

Is there any plan to put audit function on fabric? It's kind of pretty useful in some Business scenes......  And I have seen the ibm docs of idemix which had mentioned the auditor with idemix users, but I haven't found any further infos about them.

@luckforzhang  Many solutions have some type of auditor or regulator role, who owns their own peer, is involved in endorsements, and is entitled to chaincode queries to audit data. Can you be more specific about what you are looking for?

We are looking to create Ethereum ERC 20 tokens but within HL Fabric runtime. we have found that we need to use fab proxy to connect to Eth VM in HL Fabric env. And that there is a constraint of one user per fab proxy, This is a issue because we need to move tokens between users, and this means that if we need to create 5k users,  which also implies that we need to create 5K Fab Proxies. is there any way fab proxy constraint can be managed/eliminated?

What and when is the next major release of Fabric? There are rumors about v2.0 being released soon but that just doesnt make sense to me. Any clarification?

Hi All, Can anyone help me as I would want to understand code in Hyperledger Fabric. Since many source folders in golang Please let me know where is the entry point of code where to start. I want first understand code architecture and then contribute. Hope I will get advice.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=tSbKJj69FyvQgH259) @swikar I'm just a beginner, but knowing the general architecture of a fabric network is what helped me start to navigate my way through the code. So, the first-network shows that there are several containers, each performing various jobs, but the key ones are the orderer, and the peer. under fabric/ there are two directories that are named orderer/ and peer/ which each have a main.go which seems like a good place to start.

As you go through that code though, you'll realise that often they're starting servers, which you will then need to grep through fabric/ to find
</p>
<p><strong>swikar</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 04:43:07 GMT):<br/>
Thanks Sah. Will look at it. 
</p>
<p><strong>swikar</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 12:09:11 GMT):<br/>
@sah thanks I found main entry point. I still need to know where to go afterwards? architecture diagram, flow diagram where and how system works..etc. Anyone have any idea, advice. Please tell me. Thanks

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-release?msg=bq5Q3b2LFWjauBkWw) @swikar This may be a case of the blind leading the blind. I'm finding things the hard way, For example, I am trying to debug how a cli container talks to an external network. That's caused me to find github.com/hyperledger/fabric-cli, and reading *that* code has caused me to find github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/chaincode/* which has the chaincode commands that I can call (I'm reluctant to use the word invoke here because that word has special meaning in fabric) from the cli

@swikar WRT architecture/flow diagrams, I've not seen any, but if you find some I'd appreciate it if you shared :)

Having said that, I read https://medium.com/@benbjohnson/standard-package-layout-7cdbc8391fc1 some months back, it, and pages similar to it, gave me a basic understanding how code is laid out on most projects (There's no 'standard' way, it's a matter of each project organically implementing one layout or another (or even a mix) and you as someone new identifying what's been used)

It seems that 'operations|metrics' configuration in core.yaml or orderer.yaml doesn't work in 1.4.1-rc1, I tried several ways (try setting it in docker yaml ENV) but the operation service even didn't start. Do we have any information on this?
(No steps, per core.yaml, it should start as default, right?)

</p>
<p><strong>rameshthoomu</strong> (Wed, 10 Apr 2019 17:05:46 GMT):<br/>
@SaphiraBjartskular yes "latest" tag is associated with 1.4.1-rc1 images.. If you want to try 2.0.0-alpha, please use 2.0.0-alpha image tag.. `curl -sSL http://bit.ly/2ysbOFE | bash -s -- 2.0.0-alpha 2.0.0-alpha 0.4.15` or look here https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/master/install.html#install-samples-binaries-and-docker-images
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 10 Apr 2019 17:11:01 GMT):<br/>
@SaphiraBjartskular If you need stability, use Long-Term Support release v1.4.0 or upcoming v1.4.1.  If you want to try out the new features use v2.0.0-alpha.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 10 Apr 2019 17:11:05 GMT):<br/>
Since the `latest` tag is confusing we will likely retire it when v2.0 goes out mid-year.  When v1.4.1 is released (target later this week) it will get the `latest` tag. 
</p>
<p><strong>SaphiraBjartskular</strong> (Wed, 10 Apr 2019 17:22:29 GMT):<br/>

yes, the steps for a 3rd digit upgrade would be the same, although note that that kafka to raft migration is not yet supported... it is planned for v1.4.2.

you can upgrade and keep using kafka.  if you want to migrate to raft you must wait until planned v1.4.2

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:28:21 GMT):<br/>
@sstone1 @lehors We had not yet tagged fabric-samples with v2.0.0-alpha. I can do that today. Just wanted to double check with you that fabric-samples is in a good state currently, or whether you'd recommend anything else be merged before we tag.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:29:10 GMT):<br/>
well, I wouldn't say it is in good shape unfortunately
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:29:25 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:29:44 GMT):<br/>
I opened a JIRA ticket and @sstone1 said he'd look at it
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:30:31 GMT):<br/>
in the time I was able to spend on it I couldn't quite figure out the root cause
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:30:52 GMT):<br/>
when I tried to run it locally to see if I could reproduce the problem I faced a different problem!?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:31:13 GMT):<br/>
ok, let's get to the bottom of these current problem(s) before tagging
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:31:27 GMT):<br/>
we did already make some change to accommodate for couchdb taking longer to start
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:31:36 GMT):<br/>
but there is something else going on
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:32:05 GMT):<br/>
we can also tag a prior commit if we find some problem that was introduced
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:32:55 GMT):<br/>
yeah but I'm uncertain as to when it really started unfortunately
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:33:11 GMT):<br/>
at first it seemed to just be a timing issue
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:33:29 GMT):<br/>
so people tried to work around it submitting a bunch of reverify
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 07 Jun 2019 13:33:30 GMT):<br/>
e.g. we could tag commit prior to "Use official CouchDB image". but it would be kind of nice to pick up "Make FabCar use BYFN, not basic-network"
</p>

I really don't think we should be doing this at this time; if we decide to do a beta we could attempt to do this.
We really need to allocate some more time on what we are actually going to do with these samples moving forward.

@lucaslep v2.0 is not on the quarterly release schedule - the maintainers are taking the major release step as an opportunity to make some larger changes.

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 01 Jul 2019 23:51:19 GMT):<br/>
We are closing down the next quarterly release, v1.4.2, in the release-1.4 branch for a release in mid-July. While we don't do code freezes per se until release day, we need to be increasingly cautious with merges as we get into July.
There of course are automated tests running all the time and additional release testing going on, but be careful out there!

@dave.enyeart what's the process of including something in release note? https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/fabric/+/32138 makes a small change to config yaml parsing, which probably should be included in release note. thx
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 08:49:08 GMT):<br/>
We hand create the release notes, so if you want to kick things off, create a v1.4.2.txt under release_notes and then add the info under the "Changes,..." section  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 10:54:25 GMT):<br/>
@guoger Yeah, best to draft release notes as we go, but in reality I often look over the entire release content in the final weeks and draft them myself. Tagging the Jira fields "Release Note Required" and "Release Note" at least leaves a breadcrumb trail that helps me pull them together.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 10:55:22 GMT):<br/>
I've tagged this one with some placeholder text in the Jira field. Would be great to replace with better text.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 10:59:31 GMT):<br/>
If this one is v2.0, we can change v2.0.0-alpha.txt to v2.0.0.txt and evolve it for v2.0.0. Many of the alpha release notes will persist into the v2.0.0 release notes.

 v1.4.2 release update - early this week there is some final testing ongoing including testing the updated node OU support and dependency updates to couchdb, kafka, zookeeper (https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/fabric-baseimage/+/32176/). I will also be updating release notes.
If everything goes smoothly we expect to release v1.4.2 midweek.
Please post here if anybody knows of any remaining issues or tasks that need to be addressed before v1.4.2 release.

hi experts, in email list, one security problem is pointed out. only one org can upgrade  a chaincode and change its endorsing policy. This is a very serious security problem. I also notice that more versions like 1.4.x are released.  I suggest in the future version 1.4.x+1 this problem is solved after all it is a long term service version and may be used in production environment.

@qsmen This is how v1.x is designed... in the chaincode instantiation policy you identify which org should control instantiations and upgrades.  v2.0 is nearing development completion and adds support for decentralized chaincode governance where you can define a policy of which orgs need to come to agreement on chaincode definitions and upgrades. You can check out the 2.0 alpha with decentralized chaincode governance and let us know your feedback: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/master/whatsnew.html#fabric-chaincode-lifecycle

It has been a substantial amount of new design and code to support decentralized chaincode governance... if you added it all to v1.4.x you would end up with v2.0 :)

Assuming v2.0.0 to be released is not LTS, can we assume v1.4.x is going to be maintained next year ? I mean, after Jan/10th/2020 ?  I mean this statement ``` the Fabric maintainers are pledging to provide bug fixes for a period of one year from the date of release (Jan 10) ```
</p>

@mastersingh24 @dave.enyeart The fabric-baseimage update breaks the Fabric-CA FVT tests. Postgres 9.5 doesn't exist in the debian repository anymore on that OS level, so the FVT image can't be built. This won't be a problem later this week when I finish the work on making Postgres, MySQL and LDAP standalone containers, but CI will be hung up until I finish that work. Finished MySQL tonight, starting Postgres in the morning. Just an FYI in case you want to force-merge the Fabric-CA update to update baseimage 0.4.16.

Tell me about it. Its been miserable debugging it. I started going in to the run_fvt_tests script, and just limiting it to a test I knew was failing. Also removed the image rebuild from the make Target so I didn't have to wait 10 minutes for the image to build every time

what changes have been added to the release? The only note I can see is FAB-17072 and that you've moved to Azure Pipelines
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 13:40:01 GMT):<br/>
@Coada We We are working on that. For some reason GitHub isn't rendering the release notes properly. 
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 13:40:40 GMT):<br/>
If you want to check it out immediately the release notes are available in the release_notes folder in the repo
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 15:05:40 GMT):<br/>
We fixed it, it should be good now
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 15:46:47 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, release notes are rendering properly here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/releases/tag/v1.4.4
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 19:42:39 GMT):<br/>

@dave.enyeart Could HLF support to deploy on arm64v8 ? 
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Tue, 17 Dec 2019 09:38:03 GMT):<br/>
I believe Fabric should build fine on arm64v8 but we do not plan an providing any prebuilt binaries at this point.
</p>
<p><strong>githubcpc</strong> (Tue, 17 Dec 2019 09:40:40 GMT):<br/>
I find something about this in Jira.They seem to deploy HLF on Raspberry Pi 3.
</p>
<p><strong>githubcpc</strong> (Wed, 18 Dec 2019 08:10:32 GMT):<br/>
I hava already build successfully on ubuntu18.04 arm64v8. Thanks :)

<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Sat, 01 Feb 2020 09:29:26 GMT):<br/>
Is Fabric samples also released? Not getting downloaded & not even available in git repo ===> Checking out v2.0.0 of hyperledger/fabric-samples
error: pathspec 'v2.0.0' did not match any file(s) known to git.
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Sat, 01 Feb 2020 15:04:34 GMT):<br/>
@knagware9 we haven't yet tagged Fabric samples, we are working on some updates yet. But you can ignore that error for now. Since when it fails to checkout v2.0.0 it defaults to the master branch, you are getting what will eventually be the 2.0.0 tag anyway
</p>
<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Sat, 01 Feb 2020 16:44:41 GMT):<br/>
okay...did the same as of now
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Sat, 01 Feb 2020 16:50:14 GMT):<br/>
Again, just ignore the error, it doesn't affect anything. It'll be a few days till we tag samples 
</p>
<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Sat, 01 Feb 2020 16:54:11 GMT):<br/>
yes..Thanks

Hi, when are we likely to see a release with more significant performance improvements such as caching the results of Protocol Buffers unmarshaling of blocks?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 18:19:59 GMT):<br/>
@JohnSColeman you're right that is the next most obvious performance improvement to go after - https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-14645 .  The person that was going to work on it picked up something else instead. It is not scheduled for any release at the moment. I've tagged the issue as `help-wanted` for anybody to pick up.

Yeah, since we no longer keep java chaincode and node.js chaincode on the same 3rd digit releases this will happen, but it is benign because at runtime it will use most recent javaenv:1.4, and pull if needed.  I'm thinking we should simply remove javaenv and nodeenv from the download script and people can pull what they need. Alternatively it could just pull most recent javaenv:1.4. What do you think @davidkhala @BrettLogan ?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkhala</strong> (Thu, 23 Jul 2020 12:24:56 GMT):<br/>
Remove it is OK for me while we should give more hints document about chaincode language dependent image requirement.

I do agree though, there isn't really any good information about what `chaincode.builder` and `chaincode.<language>.runtime` are and the fact they should be set. So unless someone is going through the entire `core.yaml` they wouldn't even know these exist_

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 24 Jul 2020 12:36:16 GMT):<br/>
To document the outcome... fabric-javaenv and fabric-nodeenv have been removed from the download script to avoid this confusion. Those images (with 1.4 tag) will still be pulled from dockerhub if needed at runtime, but we'd expect most deployments to pull down locally if they know they will be needed at runtime.

Hello
Does anybody know when is EOL of 1.4 LTS? 
https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2019/01/10/introducing-hyperledger-fabric-1-4-lts
here it's mentioned that it will be supported for 1 year after the release and 1.4 was released on 10 Jan. 2019, but the most recent update in 1.4 is 1.4.9 (7 days ago)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 14 Oct 2020 14:13:50 GMT):<br/>
@gravity For 1.4 it is April 2021, see https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric#releases and the linked references that describe the LTS strategy

Hi, is there a `fabric-ca-client` binary that was released that can work with `2.2.1` docker images? For example using the `fabric-ca-client:1.4.9` binary an image with `hyperledger/fabric-tools` just says not found and the binary isn't working. I need it to generate certs.

Fabric CA v1.4.9 client and server can be used to generate certs for Fabric v2.2.1, but there is no packaging that ties them together as such. You can see the operations guide https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/operations_guide.html deployment guide https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/deployguide/ca-deploy.html for guidance generating the certs.

<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Fri, 29 Jan 2021 20:27:54 GMT):<br/>
Those deprecations have been around for a long time. We only supported those images in 1.4 Fabric. In 2.x fabric we switched to using publicly available open source images for things like couchdb
</p>
<p><strong>greg2git</strong> (Sat, 30 Jan 2021 13:28:22 GMT):<br/>
sorry, didn't notice the brackets in _Deprecations (existing)_ - should it say 'pre-existing' (since 2.0) ? - whenever i'm pulling >=2.0 images some of them are from a different 'source' than <2.0 ?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Sun, 31 Jan 2021 03:21:33 GMT):<br/>
None of those images were ever required to run fabric, they were convenience images to support fabric-samples. The images on dockerhub are only there to support fabric-samples, they are not meant for any other use case 
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Sun, 31 Jan 2021 03:22:07 GMT):<br/>
And fabric-samples handles pulling all of the required images for you
