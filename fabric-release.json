{"msg":"1) It is naive to believe that we can just keep on merging feature requests at the same time as trying to get to a release / release branch.  Yes - you can continue feature development and you can submit CRs and keep them up to date by rebasing while they are waiting to be merged, but we can't simply merge code which actually changes core files and then attempt to cut a release after that.  We must first get to code complete on the existing set of agreed on features (now how we do a better job of getting the release feature list is part of the release planning document)\n\n2) There may be a mis-use and/or overuse of a specific function when the reality is that perhaps 2 or more features / function are actually needed.  Eventhub is probably the greatest example of that.  So perhaps we need to have clearly defined stories rather than getting into details of implementation and calling that the story / feature.  Let me expand on Eventhub as it is a good example:\n\nAt a high level, there are at least 2 separate use cases / requirements being handled by the eventhub implementation:\n- client submits a transaction and simply wants to know when that transaction has been committed\n- entity who \"owns / runs\" the peer wishes to integrate the peer with its existing systems\n\nThose are 2 very different requirements and should be treated as such\n\n3) As we move forward, I do think having an initial agreed upon set of features for the next release milestones will be very helpful.  BUT - as @cbf points out - we then need to figure out who is going to implement them.  It's hard to control what people will choose to implement.  Now if we see a group of people ignoring major features the community asked for and just doing their own thing, we can try to address it but in many ways the community will address it by simply leaving and moving on to using something else\n\n4) When considering features, we have to make sure that we are not building a multi-headed, unmanageable and unusable monster.  There are some things which simply are not appropriate for the direction of the \"product\"","username":"mastersingh24","ts":"2017-04-13T15:42:08.293Z"}

{"msg":"Hello, I have several questions about the release and performance of hyperledger/fabric.  I started working on v0.6 in october 2016, now migrating the project to v1.0-alpha.  1) when fabric v1.0 will be stable enough to use in production mode ?  2) Should I start a project on v1-alpha and upgrade it after or wait till stable v1.0 is released ?  3) What is the number of maximum peers that fabric can handle ?","username":"aybekbuka","ts":"2017-05-01T17:44:33.763Z"}

{"msg":"Hi @aybekbuka The maintianers need to decide on exit criteria for Hyperledger-fabric v1,0 and are not declaring a date yet. I would start using the alpha, but I think they are planning on cutting a new alpha or potentially calling it Beta.  3) The maximum number of peers is really dependent on the type of chaincode, the number of endorsers.  There is going to be more system type testing happening over next 2 months where I think we will get more details on this aspect of performance. ","username":"weeds","ts":"2017-05-02T13:32:19.990Z"}

I am a Fabric beginner. \n\nIn my case (Getting Started) section was not really useful once I realized that it does not explain how to setup a dev environment and build fabric.  In the appendix I found the sections \"Setting up the dev env\" and \"Building the fabric\".  I continued there.  \nFor Java chaincode developer the prerequisites section may mention Java 8 already here.  \n\nOk, build successful what's next?   Starting a network, jumping back to \"Getting Started\" and searched for how to start a network without docker. No luck.  Ok, by just looking in build/bin I realized there is my orderer and a peer.  I started the orderer and a single peer by trail and error approach.  At some point I also realized that I can configure them using the config files in sampleconfig.  Nothing about that in the documentation.  Ok, orderer and peer are running.    Let's deploy an example chaincode. Back in the \"getting started\" section I followed the description how to install and instantiate some chaincode, in my case example02. At some point it worked.  \n\nNext, writing my own hello world chaincode.  It seems the current documentations has currently no \"getting started writing your own chaincode\" section. But an outdated version is still in the repository (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/Setup /Chaincode-setup.rst).

In the Jira item there will be a detailed test description with details on the artifacts needed for the test (client driver, associated files, etc).  \n\nThis is somewhat in PoC mode as we haven't been able to get CRs merged, so Ramesh created the link in a sandbox and cherry-picked the CRs.   Here is the Jenkins view,\nhttps://jenkins.hyperledger.org/sandbox/job/daily/test_results_analyzer/, now click the 'expand all' button in the top right of the page (we are trying to make this the default).   The results are clearly shown (PASS/FAIL/SKIPPED) and log files will be available (wip).  Let's walk through an example.  Scroll down under the ledger_lte tests and you will see, \"test_FAB_3870_VaryNumParallelTxPerChain\".   The name gives some indiction of the test, but if you want more information you can go to the Jira task, FAB-3870 (https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3870) which uses a test template and describes the test and artifacts associated with the test.   The goal is that the reader can see the test from a high level, or drill down into the code itself.   This is a WIP and all comments are welcome.\n\nGreg Haskins had a thread last week on creating a new repository for fabric integration work.   We are open to what the community decides and could easily port the work to a new repo if necessary.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nBarry Mosakowski (a.k.a bmos299)","username":"bmos299","ts":"2017-05-17T13:58:38.551Z"}

{"msg":"@greg @bur Much agreed with you - fancy having a chat about this in a small working group?  I posted a proposal for a couple of meetings (geo friendly timezones) to see who might be interested in helping to structure, write, draw and review the docs.  It seems like there's agreement that Getting Started needs work, and looking at Key Concepts, that needs some work too.  Personally, I'd like to see Getting Started walk through what is happening better by it being broken into much clearer sections that describe what's happening by gradually introducing the concepts e.g. :(empty fabric), create identities, add orderer, add peer(s), install sample chaincode, instantiate sample chancode, run sample query, run sample transaction etc etc.  As we go through these steps, we could both pictorially represent and show the commands to do it, so that by the end of GS, you understood the basic concepts and had a working system.  If you wanted to learn more, then see fuller descriptions in Key Concepts.  To your point of writing apps, it would be good to look at high level TOC structure, and how we might flesh that out too.

I simply want to avoid repeating those mistakes if it can be helped because it can be damaging to the project if that is a users first exposure.  I can appreciate the sense of urgency here.

{"msg":"So it looks like I was asked for my thoughts on licensing for binaries and JSON files.  All files, regardless of type need to have licensing identified.  This can be done through a LICENSE file in the directory containing files that cannot contain a comment with the license information.  Here is a couple examples of how this can be done:\n* OPNFV Apex: https://github.com/opnfv/apex/blob/master/LICENSE.rst -- this is an example of explicitly calling out Apache 2.0 for source code and CC-BY-4.0 for docs.  \n* containerd: https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/README.md -- see notice at bottom.  This also calls out the separate Apache / CC-BY-4.0 docs, and explicitly references the \"docs\" directory.\n\nThe idea is that we should make sure that all files have a license specified, either by including it in the files where it can be included, or by having a separate file that calls out the license for those where the license cannot be included.","username":"tkuhrt","ts":"2017-06-07T23:08:43.138Z"}

{"msg":"@cbf I’ve run through the complete Build Your First Network. A few minor issues:\n1) The network name issue - already being worked: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/10913 \n2) The byfn.sh assumes /bin is in a peer directory to /first-network, while the manual instructions assume that /bin is in a subdirectory of /first-network. Which one is correct?\n3) The Using CouchDB section uses marbles02 chaincode (JSON based), however the marbles02 chaincode is not available as an example within /first-network. Do we want to copy marbles02 into fabric-samples?  (I don’t like having multiple copies in source, ‘fabric' and 'fabric-samples', due to dual maintenance concerns.  I assume we’ll eventually remove them from ‘fabric’?)\n4) In the doc the manual instructions still reference -p during chaincode instantiate. -p has been removed. This causes an error.\n5) In the doc there are some old section name references, which do not exist after the doc refactor - can be fixed together with (4)","username":"dave.enyeart","ts":"2017-06-21T18:57:36.997Z"}

{"msg":"Two proposals for your consideration:\n*1) Jira enhancements* - With current Jira setup, it is difficult to get a good view into release content.  I would propose enhancing Jira Features as follows - split current Description into Overview/Motivation, Internal Design, and Usage sections.  Then add fields for Status (one line free text summary), Design Reviewed (no, yes (or reviewer names)), SDK Impact (unset, no, yes), Doc Required (unset, no, yes), New System Test Required (unset, no, yes). For any yes, feature must have respective subtasks completed prior to marking Done.\n*2) 1.1 Alpha content* - Without good release visibility in Jira, for now I’ve summarized proposed 1.1 release content and 1.1 alpha highlight areas in a google sheet. An alpha highlight area is a 1.1 feature that is complete enough to warrant requesting early feedback on in the short term. These are focus areas for Doc and System Test leading up to an alpha release sometime in October.  Please take a look  and either comment inline or here with thoughts.

{"msg":"@bh4rtp, I am not sure what you mean by good frontend solution. The web3 support will only work for those use contracts that can be compiled into bytecode. So in those situations we expect people will use web3 to create their frontends, as this is what I have understood as one of the main tools ethereum developers use. How we are doing this is by implementing a limited set of the ethereum json rpc apis, which means the support isn't necessarily specific to web3.
