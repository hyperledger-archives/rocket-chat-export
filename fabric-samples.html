Hi Guys. Stupid question. Can I say the container CLI in the sample means a channel

<p><strong>XingqiangMao</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 20:19:31 GMT):<br/>
After we have a container we create a channel and join the peer
</p>
<p><strong>XingqiangMao</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 20:19:48 GMT):<br/>
one peer can not be joined to 2 channel.

<p><strong>sbaxter</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 12:12:29 GMT):<br/>
For posterity: it turns out the boot process was failing on the peer nodes (revealed by examining logs of the failed docker containers); I solved this error (and a few previous errors by adding `GODEBUG=netdns=go` to the environment for the `cli` and `peer` nodes. Not sure what this does (yet) and not sure why my setup didn't work out of the box.

Hello everybody. We are understanding this sample project: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release-1.1/fabric-ca but its bringing some concerns. Apparently the setup script brings up the orderer and also creates a bootstrap channel, but the run script creates another channel with that same name. It is not really clear what is the flow of those steps, should we create all the channels at orderer and sync them ourselves to the rest of the peers or is the right way to create it again after orderer bootstrapped?

I've just completed the developer tutorial. I understand how to define a network by making up models, assets, participants, and initiate transactions. Here're my questions:  
1. How do I monitor the behavior of the peers, orderers, etc.
2. How do I monitor the blockchain itself instead of the transactions.
3. How do I check the db for the world view?
Appreciated.

Hi everybody, someone can post a sample configtx. yaml for the sample first network  with the ACL lines needed to add a new organization into the channel with only a specified organization member signature? Without a majority of signatures as default. I have tried to put "OR ('Org1MSP. member')" at several levels of configtx. yaml on the first network sample (1.2.0) using hints from https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/sampleconfig/configtx.yaml. The objective is that Org3 can get into the channel with only Org1 approval. Thanks a lot.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-samples?msg=z55Gq6xjhyLBZ7qzG) @david-kim-tpe I'm at the same point! I started looking for options for this.

In the chaincode example, marbles has a gethistoric function but I did not like it.


What I've seen and what really looks cool and hyperledger explorer, it connects a front end to a backend and peer listener, monitoring all the events that happen and showing it in a dashboard.

I'm in the process of implementing it for, using features of it in a new front end.

    TwoOrgsOrdererGenesis:

Hi 
I have couple of queries - 
1. Private Data collections - I could not find private data history , GetHistoryForKey - returns only public data 
Note: i am using public data as normal ledger , whilst only private data as Collections 
2. Is there any way i can find say recent 10 blocks from ledger, i dont see any API for it. The one we have is getBlockByTxID , which become quite tedious , since first we need to invoke transaction history and then invoke for each one of them to get Block . Any simpler way to this ?
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 24 Aug 2018 10:08:13 GMT):<br/>
@nukulsharma The API for getting history of private data is not available yet... it will become available in an upcoming release, you can track it's progress here: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5094.To get the last N blocks, you can use the event service, read about it here: https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/tutorial-channel-events.html

Hi guys, small question: Does anybody know if the exchange between all peers for all messages are encrypted Meaning can they just communicate over a public network/internet without fearing any snooping or interception

i am working on hyperledger fabric, i developed my own smart contract its working fine , did query invoke and added many more functions to it . Now what i want is to integrate it with an android app so that user can directly invoke or query data in hyperledger fabric from the android app. So what will be the best solution for this?

Hello. I've recently begun Blockchain development. I have a doubt regarding the Fabcar chaincode (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release-1.2/chaincode/fabcar/go)... When I try to install and instantiate the chaincode using the cli container, I am facing unmarshalling errors during the instantiation. It is highly likely that I am not passing the arguments in the command line correctly. How do I modify the line "peer chaincode instantiate -n mycc -v 0 -c '{"Args":["a","10"]}' -C myc" to get my Fabcar chaincode to work? Thanks.

i  think i may have find the root cause but i am not able to fix it . Is it because of single chaincode can run in one channel ?

@singhraj You can have multiple chaincodes running in the same channel but they can't have the same name and version. Change the version and it will work.

 Hi to all, I managed to start fabcar examples , just a short question the createCar inside invoke.js should'nt be able to create another item ( Car ) with the same ID ?
if i run multiple times the invoke.js it commit the transaction every time
and also if I change the args it commit changing them

<p><strong>DeepakMP</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 08:24:07 GMT):<br/>
I made some changes to most of my configuration (yaml) files mainly to try to get my orderer container to be able to talk to the peer. Now, I'm not sure what the original files are, and even if I download them again, I'm unable to make my peer talk to my orderer due to the below given error. Can someone share a working yaml document for the correct configuration in regard to this error.

Hi all, Am new to fabric and have gotten started with the fabric-samples directory and have created the first-application and first-network. However, I'm unable to create a private collection (as per section 4.5), something breaks down with orderer-peer communication and channel does not create or can instantiate chaincode. Thus I'm wondering if anyone can point me to a working repo (github or otherwise) where a simple application has been demoed with private collection feature. It is critical for my use-case but its the one thing thats not working. Simplest configuration will suffice- 1 org, 1 peer network.

The private data tutorial uses the first-network docker network.  The private data aspects do nothing to interfere with the CLI-peer-orderer communication.  I'd suggest to re-clone fabric-samples in a new directory and utilize the instructions that are known to work:

<p><strong>sheetal-hlf</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 09:48:47 GMT):<br/>
Couple of questions on Private Data
1. Does requiredPeerCount attribute in Private Data depend on the endorsement policy of chaincode?
  for e.g. if endorsement policy is  -P "AND('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')" then requiredPeerCount=2
  
 if endorsement policy is  -P "OR('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')" then requiredPeerCount=1
  
2. Also if I want multiple orgs to endorse the transaction then they must have access to Private Data
if endorsement policy is  -P "AND('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')" then policy for private data must be  "OR('Org1MSP.member', 'Org2MSP.member')"

Any comments are appreciated.

I'm trying to create or load a marbles private collection example using or that uses the node sdk. I'm not finding any good repositories or examples. The fabric-sdk-node.github.io is not as helpful as fabric documentation. ANyone can help me find a working demo (i need api access thus node sdk and I need private collections working, thus marbles)- anything else similar would also help.

Hello, I am looking into the ENC SHIM located here: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/28887/
and I am wondering if there might be any samples that implement the encryption shim? Even more specifically if there might be any samples that implement Broadcast Encryption?

I have made modifications to the fabcar.js (contract) in the FabCar example, but the changes are not reflected when I query the ledger afterwards. As of now, I have come to know that I need to install & upgrade the chaincode. So how can we do that?
Plus, I have tried running the following command: "docker exec cli peer chaincode install" on the terminal but I get this error "Error: error getting chaincode code fabcar: path to chaincode does not exist: /opt/gopath/..fabric-samples/chaincode/fabcar/javascript/lib"
What am I doing wrong? And if there are any other approaches?
</p>
<p><strong>rthatcher</strong> (Fri, 22 Feb 2019 10:19:00 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-samples?msg=dNRMgegA7ApWh9EFc) @DawoodJehangir You have the correct approach - just an error in the path name ...
The first time you `install` and then `instantiate`, the second time you `install` then `upgrade`
The path name you specify is the pathname *within* the cli docker container, so the path you want is likely to be `/opt/gopath/src/github.com/fabcar/javascript/lib`
You can verify it first by looking at the folder in the container `docker exec cli ls /opt/gopath/src/github.com/fabcar/javascript/lib`

@richzhao and @ngoctai.tnt  - are you still having trouble with another sample?  Which sample/tutorial are you working with?
</p>
<p><strong>DawoodJehangir</strong> (Fri, 22 Feb 2019 10:53:00 GMT):<br/>
@rthatcher 
I initially I ran this command:
"docker exec cli peer chaincode install -n fabcar -v 1.0 -o orderer.example.com:7050 -p ../..fabric-samples/chaincode/fabcar/javascript" 
and got that error. Then I replaced the path with the one that you mentioned above. But the error is still there.

</p>
<p><strong>richzhao</strong> (Fri, 22 Feb 2019 11:23:57 GMT):<br/>
the problem occurs when instantiate the chaincode  @rthatcher   
</p>
<p><strong>DawoodJehangir</strong> (Fri, 22 Feb 2019 11:26:05 GMT):<br/>
@rthatcher 
I have ran this command 
docker exec cli peer chaincode install -n fabcar -v 1.0 -o orderer.example.com:7050 -p /opt/gopath/src/github.com/fabcar/javascript

``` 
```
</p>
<p><strong>DawoodJehangir</strong> (Fri, 22 Feb 2019 11:44:30 GMT):<br/>
@rthatcher 
It seems like the install command has worked correctly because I got this response "2019-02-22 11:41:54.737 UTC [chaincodeCmd] install -> INFO 003 Installed remotely response:<status:200 payload:"OK" > "
So now do I need to run the chaincode upgrade command? if yes, what parameters are generally required?
</p>
<p><strong>rthatcher</strong> (Fri, 22 Feb 2019 11:55:04 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-samples?msg=Y7rT56snuaNtYbqvd) @DawoodJehangir Goods news that the install worked.  The upgrade command will be something like:
`peer chaincode upgrade -n fabcar -v 1.1.0 -l node -c '{"Args":["initLedger"]}' -C mychannel`
Note that you should have changed the version number in the `package.json` before the install and it is this new version number you use on the upgrade command.
</p>
<p><strong>DawoodJehangir</strong> (Fri, 22 Feb 2019 12:10:44 GMT):<br/>
@rthatcher Thanks for your help.
One thing that I'd like to mention is that I didn't change the version number in package.json. I only changed it in the command "-v 1.0 => -v 1.1" and it worked correctly. The modifications in the Init Ledger are being reflected now. 
Is there something wrong if we don't change it in package.json?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-samples?msg=G5BPgy5y8HrsnPyFr) @richzhao I have just worked through the steps up to and including instantiate on my test VM - so it looks OK to me - can you share some information on your environment etc:
1.  What OS are you using (I have Ubuntu 18.04)
2. What version of docker and docker compose?
3. Can you show output of `docker ps -a` command
4. Can you show the output of the peer container (starting with the line "[lscc] executeInstall -> INFO 03b[0m Installed Chaincode [papercontract] Version [0] to peer")
It is possible the problem was a temporary connection problem to dockerhub - have you retried the instantiate command?

@Jamie - the error "/etc/hyperledger/msp/orderer/msp/signcerts: no such file or directory" - suggests there is a problem with the Docker Volume mapping  
This section in the `docker-compose.yml` shows the volume mappings for the Orderer so you might want to check that the folders exist and that you have access to them:
```
    volumes:
        - ./config/:/etc/hyperledger/configtx
        - ./crypto-config/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer.example.com/:/etc/hyperledger/msp/orderer
        - ./crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/:/etc/hyperledger/msp/peerOrg1
```

@Jamie - firstly - if you have not done so, then `docker volume prune` might be a good idea
If you have re-generated the crypto material - then there is at least one change you need to make to the `docker-compose.yml` file:
The value of the environment variable `- FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CA_KEYFILE=/etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server-config/...` needs to match the new private key you have generated.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-samples?msg=Ee6vHLxw9rFAHMuqW) @rthatcher I have done those steps before. I am going to do again as follows
i) Bring up docker service

iii) cryptogen generate using crypto-config.yaml
iv) configtxgen to generate genesis and transaction block
v) update the private key value in ca service
vi) Run teardown.sh

<p><strong>rthatcher</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 12:04:05 GMT):<br/>
@Jamie - so I would suggest completely removing your fabric-samples folder and re-cloning it.  Then you should have the default crypto material and matching docker-compose file, and basic-network should start up ok with the original files.  (maybe do a teardown.sh before trying with the original files)

<p><strong>rthatcher</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 12:51:07 GMT):<br/>
@Jamie - strange.  I wonder if there is some issue with file permissions for the docker processes.  What OS are you using?  Do you have a standard docker install?  Have you logged in/out or rebooted since installing docker?  Are you using sudo, su or root for any of the steps?

I saw the issue about replacing balance sample,  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-12636 , but no update since Nov. can anyone update about this?  is the re-design document available?  @rthatcher @odowdaibm  @dave.enyeart 
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 12:52:18 GMT):<br/>
@richzhao Balance transfer has been replaced by the updated Fabcar sample (for intro-level) and new Commercial Paper sample (for intermediate-level) as the strategic samples in v1.4. There will not be a re-write of balance transfer itself, in fact it may get deleted in favor of the others.  See the new tutorial docs at https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/write_first_app.html and https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developapps/developing_applications.html

Hello Everyone,
Currently I have implemented my own smart contract using fabric-contract-api and have been able to access fabric-shim.Chaincodestub methods by doing like "ctx.stub.AnyMethodFromChaincodestubClass". 
1) So is it possible to access other fabric-shim classes (e.g. ClientIdentity, SignedProposal, etc) from context (ctx) variable similarly?
2) Is there any advantage of using fabric-shim instead of fabric-contract-api for developing smart contracts? 
As I'm working for an organization, I need to be sure if there's significant advantage of using fabric-shim over fabric-contract-api. Because then I will need to change my implementation according to fabric-shim. In my context, "advantage" really means 'more flexibility' and 'added functionality' while developing smart contract.

I have modified the first-network (network with 2 Orgs and 1 peer in each of them) and Installed my own chaincode on it. Additionally I have made a connection.yaml file to interact with the network. But when I run the client side (code given below), I encounter this error:

```
error: [Network]: _initializeInternalChannel: Unable to initialize channel. Attempted to contact 2 Peers. Last error was Error: 2 UNKNOWN: Stream removed
Failed to evaluate transaction: Error: Unable to initialize channel. Attempted to contact 2 Peers. Last error was Error: 2 UNKNOWN: Stream removed
``` 

This is the code on my client side. The error arises when `gateway.getNetwork command` is run:
```
let connectionProfile = yaml.safeLoad(fs.readFileSync('./connection.yaml', 'utf8'));

// Create a new gateway for connecting to our peer node.
const gateway = new Gateway();
await gateway.connect(connectionProfile, { wallet, identity: 'user1', discovery: { enabled: false } });
console.log("here 1");
// Get the network (channel) our contract is deployed to.
const network = await gateway.getNetwork('mychannel');
console.log("here 2");
// Get the contract from the network.
//const contract = network.getContract('fabcar');

const contract = network.getContract('bankpeerContract');
``` 

This is my connection.yaml file:

hey guys, I noticed that "Building Your First Network" doc has been updated to include the latest developments (e.g. Raft orderers), however the bootstrap.sh script is not pulling the latest version of 'first-network'. The v.1.4.0 tag that is used for checkout by the script still features the older version of the files. As a result, there's a deviation in 'first-network' files vs the corresponding doc/tutorial.

Hi, I am trying to setup test network using byfn script in fabric-samples repository (under first-network directory). On ./byfn.sh up with go, everything works fine. If I try to do the same with java (-l java) I am getting the error -
Chaincode installation on peer0.org1 has failed
ERROR !!! FAILED to execute End-2-End Scenario
Can someone please help me with debugging this ?

Hi, I'm looking for this chaincode example https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/release-1.4/chaincode/chaincode_example02/go/chaincode_example02.go so I use git command `git clone -b master https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples.git`in my ubuntu environment but once I listed the files in the directories, this file was not under sub-directory chaincode, so would you help to comment why and where it is available now?

Hi, everyone.
Now I'm working on [FAB-15104](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-15104).
I committed some changes for this JIRA.
Hyperledger Jobbuilder verifeid my changes, but after that nobody is assigned yet for the reviewer.
Could anybody review this JIRA?

Hello. I am not sure this is the right channel to ask this. I am trying to follow along what is described here (https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/write_first_app.html). 
I am at "Launch the Network" step.
My OS is Windows 10.
After launching the command there (I am using git bash) the bash appears stuck (it's not really stuck, because I can abort the process). COuld it be this is just supposed to take very long?

</p>
<p><strong>MatteoPiovanelli</strong> (Mon, 08 Jul 2019 12:59:55 GMT):<br/>
this is the output I got from the script:
```
# don't rewrite paths for Windows Git Bash users
export MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1

docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down
Removing couchdb ... done
Removing network net_basic

docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d ca.example.com orderer.example.com peer0.org1.example.com couchdb
Creating network "net_basic" with the default driver

```
</p>
<p><strong>MatteoPiovanelli</strong> (Mon, 08 Jul 2019 14:39:43 GMT):<br/>
right. After resetting docker "to factory default" the thing worked. I am not sure what had gone wrong

<p><strong>MatteoPiovanelli</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 12:56:15 GMT):<br/>
Hello. I have been following along with the samples/tutorials from https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io (I am going through the commercial paper tutorial right now).

When I get to "Update the anchor peers" the commands there fail.
</p>
<p><strong>MatteoPiovanelli</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 12:57:28 GMT):<br/>
I have been keeping the network logs in a separate bash terminal, and as soon as i try to configure an anchor peer, that starts repeating the same warning over and over

</p>
<p><strong>MatteoPiovanelli</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 13:12:08 GMT):<br/>
I get the following warning;
</p>
<p><strong>MatteoPiovanelli</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 13:12:38 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>MatteoPiovanelli</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 13:49:12 GMT):<br/>
then, on the next step, when creating the channel, I get the following warning for the orderer
</p>
<p><strong>MatteoPiovanelli</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 13:49:44 GMT):<br/>
Error reading from 172.18.0.7:43348: rpc error: code = Canceled desc = context canceled
</p>
<p><strong>MatteoPiovanelli</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 13:57:59 GMT):<br/>
that is followed by INFO:

</p>
<p><strong>MatteoPiovanelli</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 14:30:49 GMT):<br/>
the stuff that keeps repeating at the "Update the anchor peers" step is like:
Authentication failed: failed classifying identity: Unable to extract msp.Identity from peer Identity: Peer Identity [a sequence of bytes] cannot be validated. No MSP found able to do that.
</p>
<p><strong>MatteoPiovanelli</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 14:40:54 GMT):<br/>
among other messages, when I call "peer channel update" from the cli, the second one is
Unmarshal JSON: value cannot be unmarshalled: invalid character 'S' looking for beginning of value
</p>
<p><strong>MatteoPiovanelli</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 14:52:15 GMT):<br/>
I am reading through byfn.sh, and it looks like it is doing some extra steps relating to the keys and certificates
</p>
<p><strong>MatteoPiovanelli</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 15:25:53 GMT):<br/>
but I am looking at the peers created by following the steps and they seem to have the crypto information generated
</p>
<p><strong>MatteoPiovanelli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 07:33:15 GMT):<br/>
Could it be that the issu I am seeing is because the tutorial has me use docker-compose-cli.yaml, that as far as I can tell contains no CA information?
</p>
<p><strong>rthatcher</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 10:59:05 GMT):<br/>
I think that the basic-network used as a Fabric for Commercial Paper does not use TLS, whereas the BYFN network does use TLS.  So you will see a simpler configuration and simpler commands as there is no need to specify the TLS certificates.
</p>
<p><strong>MatteoPiovanelli</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:27:56 GMT):<br/>
I will double check as soon as I can get on this. I am following this tutorial https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_network.html and in the step by step partions it had me use a docker-compose that has no CA in it, and then use tls for stuff

 hi , I just cloned the fabric git directory and ran the bootstrap script. Then I tried running the first network and got the error.
Error: failed to create deliver client: orderer client failed to connect to orderer.example.com:7050: failed to create new connection: context deadline exceeded
The orderer exited right before the end to end script started and logs of orderer show : [channel byfn-sys-channel] config requires unsupported orderer capabilities: Orderer capability V1_4_2 is required but not supported: Orderer capability V1_4_2 is required but not supported
panic: [channel byfn-sys-channel] config requires unsupported orderer capabilities: Orderer capability V1_4_2 is required but not supported: Orderer capability V1_4_2 is required but not supported
Edit: it works If I reverse the changes made to the configtx.yaml in first network folder made 3 days ago.

I was trying to create a new org in balance transfer application 1.4.3 version.

Started the network, I tried to run all the REST API's as per the documentation.

After registering users on all 3 orgs, created a new channel with mychannel. Then I tried to join all the peers to all 3 orgs to mychannel.

I was able to join peers to org1 and org2 to mychannel through REST API, but when send to join peers to org3 to join mychannel it was giving below error.

[ERROR] Join-Channel - Failed to join all peers to channel. cause:Failed to join peer to the channel with error :: Error: 2 UNKNOWN: access denied: channel [] creator org [Org3MSP]

Hi everyone, I've been playing with the `fabcar` sample in https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/write_first_app.html.

I got an error when enrolling the admin.
```
$ node enrollAdmin.js
```

>  Failed to enroll admin, error:%o message=Calling enrollment endpoint failed with error [Error: read ECONNRESET
    at TLSWrap.onStreamRead (internal/stream_base_commons.js:183:27

Before this I was playing around with building your first network. I managed to execute it well.
So when I transitioned to *Writing Your First Application*, I brought down the existing network:
```bash
$ ./byfn.sh down
$ docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
$ docker rmi -f $(docker images | grep fabcar | awk '{print $3}')
```

I checked running dockers after starting fabric
```bash
$ ./startFabric.sh javascript
$ docker ps
```
Out: 
```

Hi everyone, I've been playing with the `fabcar` sample in https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/write_first_app.html.

I got an error when enrolling the admin.
```
$ node enrollAdmin.js
```

>  Failed to enroll admin, error:%o message=Calling enrollment endpoint failed with error [Error: read ECONNRESET
    at TLSWrap.onStreamRead (internal/stream_base_commons.js:183:27

Before this I was playing around with building your first network. I managed to execute it well.
So when I transitioned to *Writing Your First Application*, I brought down the existing network:
```bash
$ ./byfn.sh down
$ docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
$ docker rmi -f $(docker images | grep fabcar | awk '{print $3}')
```

I checked running dockers after starting fabric
```bash
$ ./startFabric.sh javascript
$ docker ps
```

I'm also looking for it. It's not official information but the following revision on master branch of fabric-samples repo works for my local 2.0.0-alpha environment. 
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/commits/fdf88df4c54aad65765dba3485899bb7a5dabc02
There seems not to be `v2.0.0-alpha` tag on hyperledger/fabric-samples repo. In hyperldger/fabric repo, `v2.0.0-alpha` was tagged on `Apr 10, 2019`. So I just picked up the change which was committed to fabric-samples repo at that moment . 
</p>
<p><strong>nekia</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 02:08:10 GMT):<br/>
At least, `fabric-samples/first-network` works on my local with fabric 2.0.0-alpha. FYI

It seems `fabric` repo has v2.0.0-alpha but the `fabric-samples` does not have one.

I have. byfn samples of [this revision](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/commits/fdf88df4c54aad65765dba3485899bb7a5dabc02) works on my local 2.0.0-alpha env at least.

Hey guys on HLF v2.0.0-alpha i encountered this problem while installing & instantiating chaincode
```
Error: bad response: 500 - failed to invoke backing implementation of 'QueryApprovalStatus': 
could not set defaults for chaincode definition in channel mychannel: 
Policy '/Channel/Application/Endorsement' must be defined for channel 'mychannel' before chaincode operations can be attempted

does any one know why?

yes and no.
release-1.4 version works. But not the master branch

set CouchDB and the url is probably `localhost:5984` something like this

not trying 2-alpha, need 2-master. fabric at current master.

2-master? is there such branch?

I am trying balance transfer(1.4.6) application with 2.0.0-beta I had added same policies which are defined in 2.0.0-beta first-network  configtx.yaml file  but at the time of channel creation it showing ``` [2020-03-10 11:38:30.953] [ERROR] Create-Channel - Failed to create the channel. status:FORBIDDEN reason:config update for existing channel did not pass initial checks: implicit policy evaluation failed - 0 sub-policies were satisfied, but this policy requires 1 of the 'Writers' sub-policies to be satisfied: permission denied ```  is it right way to use balance transfer using 2.0.0 -beta? please provide inputs .

hi,I want to know a difference between crypto-wallet users  and users which are created at the time of  crypto-config creation using cryptogen tools . ```artifacts/channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp/keystore/5890f0061619c06fb29dea8cb304edecc020fe63f41a6db109f1e227cc1cb2a8_sk or

using crypto-wallet users we can initiate transaction but it also possible with above mentioned users.so what is actual diffrence? or I am doing it wrong way?

crypto-wallet is for maintaining identities of users of the HLF, what cryptogen does is create kind of a developer friendly set of all the crypto artifacts you need to bootstrap and HLF network
</p>
<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Mon, 16 Mar 2020 16:18:57 GMT):<br/>
cryptogen is not intended for production networks, that's another big point

<p><strong>Antimttr</strong> (Mon, 16 Mar 2020 16:20:06 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>ssk-git</strong> (Tue, 17 Mar 2020 04:07:14 GMT):<br/>

@lehors @charlielin @heatherp I see https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/pull/160 was merged after I tagged fabric samples for v2.1.0. Should I re-tag based on this latest commit? Is there still an issue with commercial paper?

because @heatherp pointed out that the ci pipeline ran that same test successfully

I was unable to talk on the call for some reason - well I could talk all I wanted but evidently you guys couldn't hear me...
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 14:51:20 GMT):<br/>
I wanted to provide a bit of history
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 14:51:54 GMT):<br/>
there wasn't much thinking into the existing directories, it is mostly the result of organic growth
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 14:52:43 GMT):<br/>
but the reason we have a chaincode dir with a bunch of chaincodes is the result of a decision to move the various chaincode samples out of the core fabric repo
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 14:54:08 GMT):<br/>
a lot of these chaincodes were initially written to test the code that was written (by murali)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 14:54:56 GMT):<br/>
and thought of having some value to exhibit certain features
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 14:55:08 GMT):<br/>
but I agree it makes sense to clean these up as part of the revamp
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 14:55:47 GMT):<br/>
I have to say though, that I'm not sure it's a good idea to add another level a la "other" in the dir structure
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 14:56:25 GMT):<br/>
we have a README in which Nik added a description of what each sample is about
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 14:57:15 GMT):<br/>
I'd rather use this approach to direct people towards the main samples than move some of the samples into a sublevel dir
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 14:57:28 GMT):<br/>
my 2c
</p>
<p><strong>mbwhite</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 08:08:21 GMT):<br/>
to pick up on that point @lehors - the key element is that they are marked as samples that are now considered, after mature review, not to be the best. There is still some value, and kept for reference.   (my 2p)
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 14:00:54 GMT):<br/>
makes sense.  my opinion is to keep each distinct sample at the root level, use the readme to highlight the 'main' samples, and retire outdated samples (assuming we get consensus and author agreement on which ones to retire)

Hi All, We should also consider to add fabric sample for decetralised identity with DID/SSI standard implemenation. There are couple of companies build decentralised Identity using fabric for example TrustID (https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2020/04/21/trustid-a-new-approach-to-fabric-user-identity-management) and https://verified.me/

Three questions/comments...

- sudo needed to remove network
- being able to cycle round and update cc
- the keys for getStateByRange end to end..

the script `fabric-samples/test-network/network.sh` can not be run , in the function `checkPrereqs`  do not have `config` dir
</p>
<p><strong>cmgabriel</strong> (Mon, 20 Jul 2020 17:24:10 GMT):<br/>
Did you follow the steps to install the prerequisites in the 'Using the Fabric Test Network" tutorial?
</p>
<p><strong>Ferrymania</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 07:57:28 GMT):<br/>
I also meet this problem and when I git clone fabric I can't checkout v2.2.0 version ,is there something I ignore
</p>
<p><strong>newlife 1</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 13:03:07 GMT):<br/>
I found that in function `checkPrereqs` , there  require a dir called config, which is need
</p>
<p><strong>newlife 1</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 13:06:53 GMT):<br/>
but I did not find where this dir used,
</p>
<p><strong>newlife 1</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 13:07:31 GMT):<br/>
maybe this requirement can be remove.
</p>
<p><strong>newlife 1</strong> (Wed, 22 Jul 2020 13:09:31 GMT):<br/>
so I just add a soft link  to  `fabric/sampleconfig`
</p>
<p><strong>Ferrymania</strong> (Thu, 23 Jul 2020 06:23:17 GMT):<br/>
Thanks a lot I tried ,it seems network start successfully,when I try fabcar example and run  `fabcar.go`,it can query result ,but  it end with `Failed to submit transaction: Failed to submit: CreateAndSendTransaction failed: SendTransaction failed: orderers is nil`,have you meet this problem

Sorry I've been busy with the upcoming releases... Thanks @yuki-kon for your ERC20 sample. I'll also add the remaining ERC20 functions to my Go sample PR https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/pull/318 . You and I can work to make these two PRs functionally identical, with yours on Javascript and mine on Go.
</p>
<p><strong>yuki-kon</strong> (Thu, 01 Oct 2020 01:00:13 GMT):<br/>
@dave.enyeart Thank you for your feedback and congratulations on the new releases!
It's a good idea to have ERC20 sample in both Go and Javascript. I need to improve Javascript implementation to fix the ledger access. After completing it, I will ask a review again.

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 17:17:50 GMT):<br/>
for what it's worth this doesn't seem to be test-network related because I have the same problem with minifabric
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 10:56:46 GMT):<br/>
so, after more time than it should have taken me, I figured that the problem comes from the (new?) fact that /var/run/docker.sock is a symlink to my user's space which is not visible from the peer (because of course it's not mounted):
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 10:56:47 GMT):<br/>
$ ls -l /var/run/docker.sock 
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  daemon  67 Oct  9 12:53 /var/run/docker.sock -> /Users/lehors/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/docker.sock
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 11:01:21 GMT):<br/>
but I tried to mount the /Users just to see and it's still not good enough:
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 11:01:28 GMT):<br/>
Error: chaincode install failed with status: 500 - failed to invoke backing implementation of 'InstallChaincode': could not build chaincode: docker build failed: docker image inspection failed: cannot connect to Docker endpoint
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 11:01:40 GMT):<br/>
so Docker in Docker is broken
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 11:02:02 GMT):<br/>
at least the way we use it I guess
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 11:02:40 GMT):<br/>
because I did some other tests with Docker in Docker that worked fine
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 11:29:08 GMT):<br/>
I confirm Docker 2.4.0.0 breaks Fabric

I'm just starting to read up on Connection Profiles in Fabric.  The [networkConnection.yaml](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/release-2.2/commercial-paper/organization/magnetocorp/gateway/networkConnection.yaml) file linked on the Fabric ReadTheDocs [Connection Profile](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/developapps/connectionprofile.html) page appears to have been removed from the commercial-paper directory (although the "gateway" folder is still there).  Are connection profiles going away, or is there another place the connection profile is used in this sample?

Hi all, I just saw the [token utxo chaincode example](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/master/token-utxo/chaincode-go/chaincode/token_contract.go) and I think in the transfer function a check is needed to avoid "double spents". I think it is possible to add the same key more than once in the inputs array and the chaincode doesn't check for this. 
Can somebody check if I am correct, please? If so, I would be happy to create a pull request with a check against the double spent.

You're right... Fabric protects against double-spend across transactions by verifying the readsets from chaincode execution haven't changed during final validation phase, but the check for double spend within a transaction needs to go into the chaincode, a PR would be appreicated!

</p>
<p><strong>SamYuan1990</strong> (Tue, 24 Nov 2020 14:36:28 GMT):<br/>
so does fabric sample ci cover -i 2.2?

Hello, team members. I have a question about the contribution of a new non-fungible token sample.
Non-fungible tokens are used to track the ownership over digital or physical assets like artworks and real estates.
The popular standard interface is ERC-721. I created a sample Chaincode implementing ERC-721 interfaces.
The code is here. https://github.com/yukiknd/fabric-samples/tree/token-erc721/token-erc-721
Is there any chance to add this sample to fabric-samples to show the functionaries of non-fungible tokens? In that case, I will submit a pull request.

hi guys, may I know do we have osadmin cli in 2.2 release? https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/14dc7e13160ef1b7332bafb01f8ffa865116f9e7/test-network/scripts/createChannel.sh#L40
</p>
<p><strong>SamYuan1990</strong> (Fri, 29 Jan 2021 11:04:37 GMT):<br/>
we may need a tag for fabric-samples, as there no `osadmin` cli in 2.2 release. so if someone use 2.2 release tar file to get binary files, with fabric-samples as latest. there will be reported as command not found.

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 21:15:03 GMT):<br/>
@SamYuan1990 your fabric-samples tag needs to match the fabric version. If you use the documented download instructions and request 2.2.0 or 2.2.1 or 2.2.2, you'll get that version of fabric and it will checkout that tag of fabric-samples, which doesn't use osnadmin
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 21:15:56 GMT):<br/>
osnadmin is available in 2.3.0 and master of fabric and fabric-samples
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 21:16:56 GMT):<br/>
although there was an osnadmin flag change a couple days ago, we'll put out a 2.3.1 and associated tag so that they will be compatible

Hi all! The events in the "token-erc-20" go contract (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/master/token-erc-20) return empty payload but it should actually contain the payload for the "Transfer" event defined in the contract.

*Hi, recently we have upgraded our AKS kubernetes v1.17 to 1.19.7
After that we got to know that docker is deprecated and no loner we can use it.
Instead of that we can use containerD as runtime

- mountPath: /run/containerd/containerd.sock

Is it possible to separate and store CouchDB's DataBase by docType defined in ChainCode?

Example : If docType is defined as "managerUser" in the ChainCode DataModel, the CouchDB Database name is stored where it is defined as managerUser.
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Tue, 23 Mar 2021 14:45:31 GMT):<br/>
no, there is a couchdb database per chaincode. you can however include docType in your JSON and have indexes/queries leverage docType

I found that the default branch of the fabric-samples project has been changed from master to main, but the branch name master is relied on in the bootstrap.sh script, which will make the historical version of bootstrap.sh unusable.

Hello, so I have downloaded Samples for version 2.2.3 using the documented procedure "curl -sSL https://bit.ly/2ysbOFE | bash -s -- 2.2.3". I want to do the commercial-paper sample. I am able to start the network using "./network-starter.sh" at the end it says to execute ```
./organization/magnetocorp/configuration/cli/monitordocker.sh net_test
```  but I get an error. The readme says to execute ```
./organization/magnetocorp/configuration/cli/monitordocker.sh fabric_test
``` which also returns an error. I discovered that the network is actually named "docker_test". Changing that the logspout docker starts. Should I create an issue/pr to fix both things?

The value was recently changed to "fabric_test" in main branch so that should remain. v2.2.3 is tagged prior to that commit so it should be "net_test". Look at https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-18446?focusedCommentId=71742&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-71742 for an explanation and see if that workaround works for you.

Thank you!!! That worked. I added it to the commercialpaper networker-starter.sh file.

Hi. I want to register a network entity (peer/admin/user) using Fabric CA API directly through POSTMAN i.e. /api/v1/register, can anyone please tell me which things are required in the Authorization part of this POST request?
As per my research, authorization requires two things: an enrollment certificate (but of which entity???) and a signature over the certificate & body of request (do we need to put the base64 encoded certificate and JSON request body into a new file e.g. .txt file, and then produce a digital signature using Openssl and finally, convert it into base64 format?).

hey guys.
Can anyone kindly point out a code sample or documentation on how to verify if a user was already registered?
I know we can check the current Wallet for registered users, but what I'm looking for is how to do this in relationship with fabric-ca
it seems its possible to do so with CLI but i can't figure out whats the equivalent for sdk (preferably javscript)

Hello! I am trying the samples on a Apple M1 processor. I was able to start the test network after setting ```
export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64
``` but when I want to try the commercial-paper and install the chaincode I get "hyperledger/fabric-nodeenv:2.2: no matching manifest for linux/arm64/v8 " so even though I defined the docker default platform it is not taking that setting .... what should I do?
</p>
<p><strong>munapower</strong> (Sun, 30 May 2021 19:50:42 GMT):<br/>
the previous happens when running the "peer lifecycle chaincode install cp.tar.gz" from the magnetocorp folder
</p>
<p><strong>munapower</strong> (Mon, 31 May 2021 02:50:37 GMT):<br/>
I was able to move on from the above error doing a ```
docker pull hyperledger/fabric-nodeenv:2.2
```

Hello! So I am running the Commercial Paper sample and when I want to bring down the network I execute the network-clean.sh but I always get this error```
Error response from daemon: You cannot remove a running container 49cbb5176f6438f2e57f22c9c514522fa01e75b5101945b39f09d67fac8bd93d. Stop the container before attempting removal or force remove
```  on all the fabric environment docker containers (peer, orderer, ca, etc) I end up having to stop the containers manually from the docker dashboard.
</p>
<p><strong>munapower</strong> (Fri, 04 Jun 2021 23:36:21 GMT):<br/>
After researching it I found that it is because I am running samples 2.2 and I had to add the COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME="net" as well as DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64 in the network-starter.sh since I am on an Apple M1 environment, I added them to the network-clean.sh and now it does stop and delete the containers.

was that the only command you had to execute? I am also getting a similar error when it reaches line 329 of network.sh ```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/data busybox sh -c 'cd /data && rm -rf system-genesis-block/*.block organizations/peerOrganizations organizations/ordererOrganizations'
```

<p><strong>munapower</strong> (Fri, 18 Jun 2021 14:26:52 GMT):<br/>
so we discovered that the problem is with git bash that by default it uses the windows path format. we added in the commercial paper network-starter.sh the lines to set and un set the environment variables as follows```export MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1
./network.sh down
unset MSYS_NO_PATHCONV

```

Hi, I have submitted a pull request (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/pull/516). It's a backporting commit to release-2.2 from main.
</p>
<p><strong>justiny</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 15:13:20 GMT):<br/>
it seems that the build has been failing on release-2.2 branch so I additionally fixed the build failure by cherry-picking a commit from main.
