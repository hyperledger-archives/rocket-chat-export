@kuangchao It looks like your copy of example_cc.go is in executable format. Installation of executable files on the peer is not permitted.
You can set this back by running: `chmod 644 test/fixtures/src/github.com/example_cc/example_cc.go`

@cbf @jimthematrix @mastersingh24 Chris, re. your comment on commit https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/7891/ - do you have any ideas on how Go SDK can reduce dependencies on Fabric?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 10 Apr 2017 14:41:34 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 10 Apr 2017 14:42:12 GMT):<br/>
I would think this discussion is how to best do dependency management while still reusing the code :).
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 10 Apr 2017 16:06:53 GMT):<br/>
@bstasyszyn the dependency is not my complaint - it is how we are implementing
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 10 Apr 2017 16:07:53 GMT):<br/>
vendoring implies a (fairly) static relationship - I would not want to try to develop the SDK as the vendored code was being evolved.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 10 Apr 2017 16:08:43 GMT):<br/>
I know that some such as @greg.haskins loathe submodules. but there aren't lots of great options.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Mon, 10 Apr 2017 16:08:43 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 10 Apr 2017 16:10:17 GMT):<br/>
we could build the SDK in a container that includes the current dependent code, and have those containers built for a particular build of Fabric - this will get as complicated as submodules
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 10 Apr 2017 16:10:49 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda exactly
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 10 Apr 2017 17:43:42 GMT):<br/>
so, I realize I am not a maintainer on the go SDK, kind of uncool to merge when someone gives a -1 or -2
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 10 Apr 2017 17:44:11 GMT):<br/>
in this case, I can appreciate the need to get the code in, but still
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 10 Apr 2017 17:44:17 GMT):<br/>
I was trying to be helpful
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Mon, 10 Apr 2017 17:44:43 GMT):<br/>
vendoring is not the long or even short term answer
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 10 Apr 2017 18:34:08 GMT):<br/>
@cbf - thanks for this - for sure, need advice on this topic! vendoring is problematic.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 10 Apr 2017 18:34:39 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 00:34:12 GMT):<br/>
@cbf - btw, the current mechanism for CI uses the contents of https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/scripts/fabric_test_commitlevel.sh for determining what version of fabric to test against (by building and deploying that version of the fabric docker containers).
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 00:35:00 GMT):<br/>
(similar to the vendoring a certain version of fabric).
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 00:35:44 GMT):<br/>
I am curious on your docker build idea. (sorry i'm just getting back to this thread)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 01:25:25 GMT):<br/>
yeah, I had different ideas about improving dependencies through pinning build output in images. 
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 02:37:28 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda @cbf  looks like dependency management is something the golang core team have been working on and have proposed a roadmap: https://github.com/golang/dep/wiki/Roadmap, not sure inventing something ourselves for the time being is worth the effort
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 02:39:08 GMT):<br/>
also, what's the concern on using govendor for the time being? things getting out of sync with the source because it had to be done manually and is explicitly managed via checking into source control? note that it is not a unique situation to the golang dependencies, all the SDKs so far had to deal with the same situation for the protos
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 02:41:32 GMT):<br/>
guess what I'm saying is for now manually manage the vendor folder, and it's by and large manageable (although definitely far from being optimal). and utilize whatever the official dependency management tool when it comes out later this year
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 02:41:40 GMT):<br/>
just my 2 cents...

@passkit - i had different issues with Go 1.8 that are now resolved after upgrading to 1.8.1. What versions do you have checked-out, and what commands are you running to build?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 12:40:59 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda my main concern is the coordination and the churn in the codebase
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 11 Apr 2017 12:42:09 GMT):<br/>
if things were more stable, might be an option

In `fabric-client/events/eventhub.go` line 185, the connection timeout is specified as an integer which causes a remote connection to timeout.  Can you change to `time.Second * 5` or fix `.NewEventsClient` to accept and process an integer?
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 07:07:07 GMT):<br/>
Also, in the event of a txCallback error, it would be helpful to pass through the error code to avoid unnecessary processing to determine whether or not to retry the transaction. 
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Thu, 13 Apr 2017 08:34:17 GMT):<br/>
Another helpful change would be to not to write any logging output until the log-level has been set.  Currently`config.InitConfig` logs 3 items before the log level has ben set, making it impossible to suppress.

In the SDK docs for `sendTransaction()` (see here: https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/Chain.html#sendTransaction__anchor)
it states that it returns a `BroadcastResponse`. This raises a couple of questions for me.
- Firstly, can I return an object from my chaincode when *invoking* a method (I'd like to return a status struct which contains a lot of detail about what the chaincode has done)
- Secondly, the returned `BroadcastResponse` looks like this `[ undefined, { status: 'SUCCESS' } ]`. What is the `undefined` part supposed to be?
</p>
<p><strong>fennelD7</strong> (Mon, 24 Apr 2017 09:06:23 GMT):<br/>
Hello, can anybody give me a little help?
In these two functions:
```chain.QueryBlock
chain.QueryBlockByHash```

Response common.block is like:
```type Block struct {
	Header   *BlockHeader   `protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=header" json:"header,omitempty"`
	Data     *BlockData     `protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=data" json:"data,omitempty"`
	Metadata *BlockMetadata `protobuf:"bytes,3,opt,name=metadata" json:"metadata,omitempty"`
}

type BlockHeader struct {
	Number       uint64 `protobuf:"varint,1,opt,name=number" json:"number,omitempty"`
	PreviousHash []byte `protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=previous_hash,json=previousHash,proto3" json:"previous_hash,omitempty"`
	DataHash     []byte `protobuf:"bytes,3,opt,name=data_hash,json=dataHash,proto3" json:"data_hash,omitempty"`
}

type BlockData struct {
	Data [][]byte `protobuf:"bytes,1,rep,name=data,proto3" json:"data,omitempty"`
}

type BlockMetadata struct {
	Metadata [][]byte `protobuf:"bytes,1,rep,name=metadata,proto3" json:"metadata,omitempty"`
}```

But I can't find more, how can I parse BlockData and BlockMetadata, get the informations like `number of transactions in the block`, `date/type/chaincode of the transactions`?

@fennelD7 The BlockData struct contains the transactions. You can unmarshal the transaction envelope protobufs inside BlockData by doing something like this: 
```
	env := &common.Envelope{}
	err = proto.Unmarshal(data, env); 
```

@divyank  Thank you very much!
I traced to ChannelHeader 
```type ChannelHeader struct {
	Type int32 `protobuf:"varint,1,opt,name=type" json:"type,omitempty"`
	Version int32 `protobuf:"varint,2,opt,name=version" json:"version,omitempty"`
	Timestamp *google_protobuf.Timestamp `protobuf:"bytes,3,opt,name=timestamp" json:"timestamp,omitempty"`
	ChannelId string `protobuf:"bytes,4,opt,name=channel_id,json=channelId" json:"channel_id,omitempty"`
	TxId string `protobuf:"bytes,5,opt,name=tx_id,json=txId" json:"tx_id,omitempty"`
	Epoch uint64 `protobuf:"varint,6,opt,name=epoch" json:"epoch,omitempty"`
	Extension []byte `protobuf:"bytes,7,opt,name=extension,proto3" json:"extension,omitempty"`
}```
Seemed like what I was looking for, unmarshaled til it I got:
```type:3 channel_id:"testchannel" tx_id:"adc982638cefbd8661544315c9ec3470846e30e8ec0bcedeeed5135f5c62e2d5" extension:"\022\006\022\004lccc"```
So, a few questions more :)
1. In the data I got, there are no Version and Timestamp, where are these two attributes?
2. The type is defined like:
```enum HeaderType {
    MESSAGE = 0;                   // Used for messages which are signed but opaque
    CONFIG = 1;                    // Used for messages which express the channel config
    CONFIG_UPDATE = 2;             // Used for transactions which update the channel config
    ENDORSER_TRANSACTION = 3;      // Used by the SDK to submit endorser based transactions
    ORDERER_TRANSACTION = 4;       // Used internally by the orderer for management
    DELIVER_SEEK_INFO = 5;         // Used as the type for Envelope messages submitted to instruct the Deliver API to seek
    CHAINCODE_PACKAGE = 6;         // Used for packaging chaincode artifacts for install
}```
how can I parse the type and get to know if the transaction's type is genesis or instantiate?
3. I didn't find date and chaincode name with the transactions, do I need to get them elsewhere or parse deeper into Block.Data.Data.Payload? could you give me some guide?

Ends up i had the wrong certificates in /tmp/enroll_user and /tmp/keystore from previous runs.

@aleksandar.likic Thank you for your reply. I did a fresh install for both fabric and fabric-ca version v1.0.0-alpha. However i still get this error when running the integration tests.

@here hi guys. I'm trying to make a CLI app with fabric-sdk-go and got stuck into some strange issue. Here is my pretty straight-forward code:
```
import (
fabricClient "github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/fabric-client"
bccspFactory "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bccsp/factory"
...
)
...

func main() {
err := bccspFactory.InitFactories(nil)
cryptoSuite := bccspFactory.GetDefault() /* 1 */

client := fabricClient.NewClient()

client.SetCryptoSuite(cryptoSuite) /* 2 */
```
It doesn't even compile! Error in the last line:
```
cannot use cryptoSuite (type "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bccsp".BCCSP) as type "github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/vendor/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bccsp".BCCSP in argument to client.SetCryptoSuite:
	"github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bccsp".BCCSP does not implement "github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/vendor/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bccsp".BCCSP (wrong type for Decrypt method)
		have Decrypt("github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bccsp".Key, []byte, "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bccsp".DecrypterOpts) ([]byte, error)
		want Decrypt("github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/vendor/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bccsp".Key, []byte, "github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/vendor/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bccsp".DecrypterOpts) ([]byte, error)
```
As far as I understand types `BCCSP` in line 1 and line 2 are the same but located in different packages: "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bccsp" and "github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/vendor/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bccsp".
How can I fix that??? Probably I don't understand something important in Go?

Somewhere I need to specify the ChaincodeSpec.Type to be CAR (not GOLANG, which appears to be the default) but I can't find a way to do that using any of the higher level functions of the SDK. Do I need to go down to the lowest level API functions implement my own helpers to interact with CARs?

@lenin.mehedy You can override this with your application configuration while calling NewPeer() or NewOrderer() which support relative paths as well.

<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 13:45:35 GMT):<br/>
Hi @antitoine, your build is failing because your application contains multiple definitions of the pkcs11 library. One used by fabric-sdk-go, and the other comes from your GOPATH when you initialize BCCSP. We handle this by using a tool like `govendor` to flatten these dependencies. After installing the tool, in your application directory, run: `govendor init && govendor add +external`

Hi everyone, I’m  at the crossroad of making a choice between `fabric-sdk-node` or `fabric-sdk-go`. Will `fabric-sdk-go` work with fabric alpha2?  I saw @troyronda ’s response to @zhoupeiwen regarding the status being updated, but … 
Is it worthwhile waiting? I’m a bit under time pressure to set up a pilot and I really would like to do the backend and chaincode in go. Thanks.

Hi @antitoine, I don't believe the SDK is thread safe. In my application, I have a RWMutex lock on the SDK instance to synchronize access from different go routines.

<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Tue, 23 May 2017 16:05:40 GMT):<br/>
@lenin.mehedy The end to end test is a good place to start. It creates a transaction on the blockchain and queries the result of the transaction.

@divyank Thanks! I will add a mutex too. But if I initialise multiple instance of the SDK, contact the same peer is not an issue ?

Hey guys, @troyronda is there a mistake either in the `Makefile` or the `README.md` file on GitHub https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go  ? The command `make check` doesn’t work, because it should be `make checks` looking at  `Makefile`
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 11:01:41 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @habpygo - I added the fix to https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/9743/

Hi, by following E2E tests, I'm trying to install and instantiate another chaincode (not example_cc). The installation works, but the instantiate not. The orderer respond with an error provide by the example_cc chaincode (`SendInstantiateProposal Endorser localhost:7051 return error: Error calling endorser 'localhost:7051':  rpc error: code = 2 desc = Transaction returned with failure: Incorrect number of arguments. Expecting 4`). Why ? Do I need to do some work with orderers ?

<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 16:10:29 GMT):<br/>
@antitoine It looks like that error message is generated by example_cc. Maybe check the arguments to install and instantiate to make sure the correct chaincode is being used?

Hi, I've found that there are no tags in go-sdk. Now I need to use go-sdk in fabric alpha1, which commit should I checkout?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 25 May 2017 14:59:42 GMT):<br/>
@fennelD7 - gosdk master is currently at alpha1
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 25 May 2017 14:59:58 GMT):<br/>
it will be updated to alpha2 targetting next week

@divyank Thanks, my problem was the chaincode version. I tried to instantiate the chaincode version v0.0.1 and I think it was the previous chaincode version number, so the `example_cc` (right ?). I upgraded to v0.0.2 and the instantiation (after the install) works.
</p>
<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 09:20:40 GMT):<br/>
@divyank Thanks, my problem was the chaincode version. The docker image isn't cleaned, so every time the same chaincode was loaded.
</p>
<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 09:21:55 GMT):<br/>
It was not very obvious, maybe an error can help if we instantiate a chaincode with the same version number ?

any one has any idea if there are any resources for writing Blockchain smart contracts for Hyperledger in Go?
books, podcasts, videos, paid premium content, or even private courses
i cannot find anything other than IBM website course which is not that comprehensive
any help from the Golang community will be highly appreciated

@troyronda Hi Troy, has fabric-sdk-go targeted for alpha2 been released?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 22:55:29 GMT):<br/>
(The readme.md doesn't indicate such, but documentation sometimes falls out of date, so I wanted to make sure)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 22:55:47 GMT):<br/>
not yet - still working on it
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 23:05:26 GMT):<br/>
Is it known that the current state of fabric-sdk-go will not work against alpha2?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 01:23:39 GMT):<br/>
Or better yet, when it's estimated that alpha2 will be supported?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 01:24:18 GMT):<br/>
I've been struggling with fabric-sdk-node, and fabric-sdk-go looks much much clearer and simpler (on top of being written in a statically compiled language)
</p>
<p><strong>holocron</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 01:26:45 GMT):<br/>
it helps a bit that fabric's all written in go too :D
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 02 Jun 2017 03:09:41 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 14:57:03 GMT):<br/>
BTW (and I know you know it @troyronda ) we are about to have another release/tag. So if it is easier to work against the *master* branch of fabric, which we are freezing, it may save you a full "cycle".
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 14:57:50 GMT):<br/>
The Node SDK has been updated between alpha2 and master ( <--- the upcoming *v1.0.0-beta* )
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 15:10:28 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanLevi  - Yes we were chatting about this possibility this morning.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 15:11:07 GMT):<br/>
The plan is to wrap up the existing work on alpha2 ... do a quick smoke test against master. if it works then we plan to just go against beta; otherwise push what we have.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 15:11:48 GMT):<br/>
In the latter case, then quickly work on the beta changes :)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 15:11:52 GMT):<br/>
Yes, this makes sense too. In a way there is a larger "diff" between beta and alpha, compared to alpha2 and alpha.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 15:12:08 GMT):<br/>
Yes... alpha1 -> alpha2 turned out to be bigger than expected.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 15:12:15 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I understand. Just thought I should the 2 lines above. Makes sense.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 15:12:24 GMT):<br/>
Oh yeah. Tell me about it ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 15:12:30 GMT):<br/>
haha.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 15:12:42 GMT):<br/>
Hopefully we will know soon.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 15:13:26 GMT):<br/>
Really a lot got into alpha2, which is also a Good Thing (tm), but it carries/carried a lot more other changes that are/were required along with it.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 15:13:29 GMT):<br/>
btw - partially this is due to not starting on the alpha2 work until it was tagged.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 15:13:51 GMT):<br/>
we will need to figure out a flow for the future where we don't have this impediment.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 15:14:18 GMT):<br/>
(aka Go SDK against master vs latested tagged)
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 15:14:36 GMT):<br/>
Trying to make these converge better, going forward. I am/we are blocking a LOT of stuff from getting into the master branch these days.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 15:14:51 GMT):<br/>
Hopefully from *beta* to *GA* things will go smoother.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 15:15:01 GMT):<br/>
I'm sure it will :)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 15:15:28 GMT):<br/>

</p>

@guruce Yes, we do support chaincode events in alpha2. See eventhub.RegisterChaincodeEvent() https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/v1.0.0-alpha2/fabric-client/events/eventhub.go#L387

If I'm not THAT bat, perhaps the make has to get some changes too ?

hi @dolanor - head is currently compatible with 1.0.0-beta. We wanted to apply the next tag once we settle down on some outstanding tickets.

</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Fri, 23 Jun 2017 14:34:19 GMT):<br/>
@jmcnevin the build is failing because your application contains multiple definitions of BCCSP. One used by fabric-sdk-go, and the other comes from your GOPATH. We handle this by using a tool like `govendor` to flatten these dependencies. After installing the tool, in your application directory, run: `govendor init && govendor add +external`

@here the Go SDK has been updated to support 1.0.0 RC1 (and still works with beta).
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 15:12:56 GMT):<br/>
Great.  Noticed a potential bug in pkg/fabric-client/events/eventhub.go (259).  The regTimeout for the event hub is hardcoded as an int of 5, not a time.Duration.  This short timeout may work when testing locally, but over a network, the connection is terminated prematurely.  Ideally, this should be configurable, or set to a higher value (E.g. time.Duration(time.Second*5)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 19:43:00 GMT):<br/>
yup - in general, I think there should be configurable timeouts (there are other places as well).

I checked the test/integration and they all use the enrollement system (if I'm not wrong). Is there an example of use without a live fabric CA, and only using certs and private locally stored?
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Wed, 28 Jun 2017 12:35:15 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr Yes, that is the sample configuration provided.

<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Wed, 28 Jun 2017 12:35:53 GMT):<br/>
@dolanor We have utility methods to load pre-enrolled users. Example here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/85fa3101eb4694d464003c3a900672d632f17833/test/integration/utils.go#L32

Looking at `pkg/util/chain_util.go` I see:

```
func SendInstallCC(client api.FabricClient, channel api.Channel, chainCodeID string, chainCodePath string, chainCodeVersion string, chaincodePackage []byte, targets []api.Peer, deployPath string) error {
```

But the `channel` parameter is unused, presumably because chaincode installs to a peer not to a channel.  But I see the integration test trying to pass in a channel.  This seems like a mild bug to me?
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Wed, 28 Jun 2017 15:34:42 GMT):<br/>
@jyellick Thanks for pointing that out. We are refactoring those utils and will remove the unused parameter.

dumb question from a golang rookie... I've been able to get as far as calling `channel.QueryInfo()`.  I notice that `currentBlockHash` and `previousBlockHash` come back as byte arrays.  What would be the best way to cast those values as strings?
</p>
<p><strong>jmcnevin</strong> (Fri, 30 Jun 2017 14:22:55 GMT):<br/>
simply doing something like string(bytes) gives me back something not very pretty

<p><strong>jmcnevin</strong> (Fri, 30 Jun 2017 14:25:45 GMT):<br/>
nvm, that seems to do the trick: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/core/chaincode/platforms/java/hash.go#L88

@jmcnevin If you are looking for a slightly more compact encoding, you could also do base64: https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/base64/

Hi guys !
I'm attempting to adapt the go sdk for one of my project, and I'm stuck at something. Here's my function :
```
func getChannels(url string) ([]string, error) {                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
    chaincodes := make([]string, 0, 5)         
                                      
    sunchainconfig, err := config.InitConfig("./config.yaml")
    if err != nil {                            
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("Error while initializing config : %v", err)
    }                                          
                                      
    client := fabricclient.NewClient(sunchainconfig)
                                               
    cert := "./certificates/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/peers/peer0.org1.example.com/msp/cacerts/ca.org1.example.com-cert.pem"
    hostname := "sunchain_peer0.1.0fc2hscyyhrtwzescfnp8qltj"
                                               
    peer, err := peer.NewPeerTLSFromCert(url, cert, hostname, sunchainconfig)
    if err != nil {                            
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("Couldn't create peer : %v", err)
    }                                          
                                      
    response, err := client.QueryChannels(peer)
    if err != nil {                           
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("Couldn't query the chaincode : %v", err)
    }                                         
                                      
    chaincodes = append(chaincodes, response.String())
                                              
    return chaincodes, nil            
}           
```
When I try to call it in my tests, I get the following error :
` client_test.go:22: Error querying the blockchain:  Couldn't query the chaincode : QueryByChaincode return error: CreateTransactionProposal return error: Error getting creator: User is nil `
Thing is, the functions I call don't permit me to specify any user. Any idea on how I could get this through ?

<p><strong>rishabh1102</strong> (Mon, 03 Jul 2017 14:19:32 GMT):<br/>
How can I do that

<p><strong>rishabh1102</strong> (Mon, 03 Jul 2017 14:21:00 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Mon, 03 Jul 2017 14:25:37 GMT):<br/>
@rishabh1102 the best demonstration for now is the integration test (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/base_test_setup.go#L218) and the CLI app (https://github.com/securekey/fabric-examples/tree/master/fabric-cli/)

By multiple invokes, I mean, that they should be issued in parallel, at a frequency of 60Hz
At least 60Hz*

I got : `	client_test.go:13: Error quering the blockchain  couldn't get the channel: Not implemented yet` while trying to use fabric-sdk-go.
But I'm wondering, how are the e2e tests pass then? I guess it is implemented, no?
</p>
<p><strong>dolanor</strong> (Tue, 04 Jul 2017 16:37:22 GMT):<br/>
Found it, in fact, GetChannelInfo is not implemented. You're not using it in the tests…
</p>

@dolanor Can you point me to the method that returns Not implemented? We have channel info at api/Channel.QueryInfo(). That might be what you're looking for.

Hi,

Sorry if this has already been ask but couldn't find it in the search.

Is is currently better advised to start from the Base and E2E unit test implementations or I could start from the CLI demo app as well?  While going through the code I noticed that while the CLI app targets the rc version, the vendor dependencies are out of sync as a lot of things changed it seems. No more fabric-sdk-go/pkg/util, differentiation between the api folders (before just /api now apifabclient etc).

I guess the unit tests have the more up to date implementations?

Thanks

@passkit I believe this is by design. `internal` is a reserved golang package that cannot be accessed from outside. More info here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e8kOo3r51b2BWtTs_1uADIA5djfXhPT36s6eHVRIvaU/edit

Hi, I finished a very simple tutorial that explain bases of the Fabric SDK Go. Because of the lack of documentation, I experienced a lot of difficulties when I started a new project with this SDK. I'm not a Go expert and even less with Hyeperledger Fabric. So I hope this tutorial will help someone: https://github.com/chainHero/heroes-service
</p>
<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 14:10:36 GMT):<br/>
The SDK Go is really great, thanks for your work. If you have any suggestions about this tutorial, I'm really open.
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 14:25:58 GMT):<br/>
I have a quick question on the use of multiple peers.  I see `setup.Channel.PrimaryPeer()` is used exclusively in the examples to select a peer.  What if that peer is unavailable? How to fallback and retry with other peers?
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 14:29:12 GMT):<br/>
@antitoine Just taken a quick look at your tutorial.  Having felt similar pain getting started, I am sure it will be very welcome.  You might want to check it with the latest version though, as the last few commits have made some radical breaking changes.
</p>
<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 14:38:06 GMT):<br/>
@passkit look at this part https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/3a54d75a9d4734133c41cad3f0198800d25717ac/pkg/fabric-client/channel/txnproposer.go#L127
Like you see, you can provide an array of peer and for each peer given, a request is made. So I think that if a peer doesn't answer, this is not an issue.
Thanks for the feedback, I will try to update the tutorial.
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 14:40:20 GMT):<br/>
@antitoine - I'm not sure that is ideal though, in that it generates extra and unnecessary traffic by sending to all peers each time.
</p>
<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 14:42:56 GMT):<br/>
@passkit You can choose to just give one peer (array of size one) when you send the proposal and switch to another peer if there is a timeout or an error. But by sending to every peers given, It's the best way to get a quick response.
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 14:44:48 GMT):<br/>
That was my conclusion - although, I was hoping that the SDK would be able to automate that, given that the peers are readily available.
</p>
<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 14:55:42 GMT):<br/>
Maybe the SDK already implements a kind of failure detector? I don't know. But I think it's possible to keep a list of available peers and remove one during a period of time if it doesn't answer. The SDK can ask randomly to two or three peers from this list. I think that this is the best compromise.
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 15:02:24 GMT):<br/>
I see that for queries, the primary peer is hardcoded into `fabrixtxn.QueryChaincode`
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 15:05:47 GMT):<br/>
With `CreateAndSendTransactionProposal` now being contained within the internal package, the only option to specify a different peer for queries seems to be to build custom `CreateAndSendTransactionProposal` function

@troyronda - any reason why the TransactionID is not returned from fabtictxn InvokeChaincode?  When integrating with 3rd party systems, this would be useful info for audit purposes.

Also just found that for CA Enrollment it is impossible to set the CSR.  This makes it impossible to set an OU and means that the certificate cannot be used as fabric now validates the OU

<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Sun, 09 Jul 2017 11:15:40 GMT):<br/>
For now, I'm getting by by modifying the function to accept a CSR.  I can think of several reasons why I would like full control over the CSR, as the subject parameters can vary greatly.
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Sun, 09 Jul 2017 11:18:54 GMT):<br/>
As a general rule, if the Hyperledger Fabric APIs allow a parameter, it should be accessible via the SDK.  I keep stumbling across omissions which is making the SDK a little painful to use.

Hi @troyronda, you were right! There was a version problem with Go. Strange though, because running `go version` it gave me 1.8, but running `which go ` and then looking at the resulting directory `cat VERSION` gave me 1.7.

The `TransactionProposalError` error type is extremely verbose.  Currently I need to implement a parser to get the raw response from fabric.  These messages are great for debugging, but in a production environment, it is expected that not all transactions will be endorsed, and it should be easier to access the rejection reason.
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Mon, 17 Jul 2017 03:13:47 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 I think that it has already been implemented.  I am using the SDK with multiple CAs and I can configure the individual CA name in the config file.

`InvokeChaincode` currently only returns a txID and an error.  The proposal response is dropped.  Is there a reason for this?  Currently, I need to invoke chaincode, then query the chain to determine the new asset value.  This is inefficient and not reliable since the block may not have yet propagated to the peer.

<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Fri, 21 Jul 2017 08:15:44 GMT):<br/>
Hi @paul.sitoh, I think you should turn the question around. 

Since Hyperledger Fabric uses the Go programming language for many of its components (https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prereqs.html#go-programming-language) and Chaincode is written in Go as well, one wonders why one should develop in other languages than Go. I don’t have an answer for this other than guessing that more people are using, for example, Node.js instead of Golang.

@paul.sitoh we’re entering the concept of subjectivity here, but I’ll give it a try … 

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine or, otherwise stated, Node.js combined Google's V8 JavaScript engine, an event loop and a low-level I/O API. Golang was created by Google; I guess not because they were so madly in love with Node.js. 

Yes Go is super fast, and no as I stated before, I do not know why Golang is not pushed more in/by the Hyperledger Fabric community.

I don’t think Golang is difficult to learn; however,  if you search for an answer re- Go programming there is a little bit more effort involved since the user base is less. Having said this, if you go to the site https://forum.golangbridge.org/ your question will be answered quickly.

If you want to try the Fabric-SDK-Go, why don’t you have a look at @antitoine ’s tutorial at https://github.com/chainHero/heroes-service and see for yourself how efficient it is doing all the work in just one Go (yeah, yeah pun intended).

@paul.sitoh My sense is that the people who think "golang is hard" are javascript-only developers who aren't used to statically-typed languages.  And because the JS ecosystem is so huge, it makes golang seem small, which it really isn't.  In the grand scheme of things, golang is a very simple and easy language to use (compare to C, C++, Java, Haskell, etc), and is designed that way even at the expense of some programming language constructs that were deemed "too complicated for many people" (for example, exceptions and generics).
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Sun, 23 Jul 2017 21:52:52 GMT):<br/>
Furthermore, the fact that golang is statically type checked means that the compiler is doing more work for you -- disallowing malformed operations, as well as producing faster code.

Ah, this appears to be a result of the differences between go 1.6 and 1.7.. in 1.7 "context" is a standard lib.  Is it intentional that fabric-sdk-go requires go 1.7?

@rohitrocket Search for framework for the Web environment in Go (like Revel), but maybe in your case the Node SDK is more appropriate if you are not familiar using Go.
For now, I have only build simple web application with Go, so I'm not an expert

Even outside of fabric-sdk-go govendor has not been a good experience, but we are somewhat forced to used it because the fabric sdk requires that `vendor/` directories be flattened/merged afaik.

<p><strong>bmatsuo</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 17:57:08 GMT):<br/>
you need to use the `govendor` tool to vendor the fabric-sdk-go because it "flattens" all nested vendor directories
</p>
<p><strong>bmatsuo</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 17:57:39 GMT):<br/>
so the github.com/hyperledger/fabric/... packages your codes uses will become the same as the one used by fabric-sdk-go

I'm having trouble adapting the fabric-sdk-go integration test configuration (`test/fixtures/config/config_test.yaml`) to my own project. When I call the event hub `Connect()`method I get the following error back

> Error from eventsClient.Start (rpc error: code = Unknown desc = event message must be properly signed by an identity from the same organization as the peer: [failed deserializing event creator: [Expected MSP ID Org1MSP, received peerorg1]]

<p><strong>bmatsuo</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 22:37:39 GMT):<br/>
As far as I can tell the peer containers for the integration tests are configured to have MSP ID Org1MSP, but somehow they do not reject the event message on `Connect()`

<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 00:00:46 GMT):<br/>
@bmatsuo `EventHub.Connect()` uses `client.UserContext.Identity` to sign requests. You can check to make sure that your `User.MSPID` is set to what the peer expects

your key store is read only
</p>

@rohitrocket Read the error, in general this give you the problem that you can try to solve
</p>
<p><strong>rohitrocket</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 08:12:07 GMT):<br/>
@AlexanderEx123 so how do I change it from read only to something else ?
</p>
<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 08:16:03 GMT):<br/>
@rohitrocket `sudo chown -R rocket:rocket <path to your KeyStore>` to own the directory/file 
</p>
<p><strong>rohitrocket</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 08:16:33 GMT):<br/>
ok let me do it
</p>
<p><strong>rohitrocket</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 08:21:50 GMT):<br/>
@antitoine Actually I am using the API provided by fabric-sdk-go itself... unable to figure out the exact directory of keystore file they are using.
</p>
<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 08:24:55 GMT):<br/>
If you have used example provide in Fabric SDK Go, the KeyStore is in `/tmp/msp` see: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/config/config_test.yaml#L23
</p>
<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 08:26:06 GMT):<br/>
You can also re-initialise your environment by removing the directory
</p>
<p><strong>rohitrocket</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 08:30:52 GMT):<br/>
I think its somewhere other than /tmp/msp place.
</p>
<p><strong>rohitrocket</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 08:31:00 GMT):<br/>
Still getiing the error @antitoine 
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 09:06:26 GMT):<br/>
First, try to call `InitFactories()` like in test integration (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/fabric_ca_test.go#L67) to avoid warning
</p>
<p><strong>rohitrocket</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 09:28:07 GMT):<br/>
Warning won't cause any problems. That can be ignored. 
</p>
<p><strong>rohitrocket</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 09:28:44 GMT):<br/>
@here does anyone have any idea ?
</p>
<p><strong>zhasni</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 09:29:31 GMT):<br/>
yes ! stop using @ here ^^
</p>
<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 09:35:50 GMT):<br/>
@rohitrocket A good practice is to avoid any warning and error in your program. If you call `InitFactories()` you will maybe set correctly the KeyStore and avoid the next error. You also can post your issue on stackoverflow.
</p>
<p><strong>rohitrocket</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 10:50:54 GMT):<br/>
@antitoine how do I make sure that the myconfiguration is good enough to run initfactories().
</p>
<p><strong>rohitrocket</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 10:50:56 GMT):<br/>
?
</p>
<p><strong>rohitrocket</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 10:52:03 GMT):<br/>
I mean how do I set the proper keystore. The link which you provided there was a function.... CSPConfig() "what exactly should be returned by this function ?

The only place "peerorg1" shows up in my project is in the sdk's yaml configuration as an item `network.organizations`. But, `network.organizations.peerorg1.mspID` is set to "Org1MSP". So why is the client using "peer1org" as its MspID?

<p><strong>bmatsuo</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 19:53:37 GMT):<br/>
@AlexanderEx123 afaik the open file limit affects your entire process. the way to increase the limit for a process is os dependent so you can probably google that info for your situation.
</p>
<p><strong>bmatsuo</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 19:54:59 GMT):<br/>
On linux the default limit on open files in one process is 1024, which is low
</p>
<p><strong>bmatsuo</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 19:56:27 GMT):<br/>
But without a lot of other open file or network connections I would say it sounds suspiciously like a resource leak

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 20:55:14 GMT):<br/>
the code within fabric-txn and fabapi is still in flux. 
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 20:55:44 GMT):<br/>
directory structure is basically pkg/* low-level but mainly independent packages that could logically have been there own repo

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 20:55:44 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 20:56:11 GMT):<br/>
def/* intended to be default implementations of pkg where the sdk user could swap out packages if they wish
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 20:56:18 GMT):<br/>
and higher-level SDK functions
</p>
<p><strong>bmatsuo</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 20:56:44 GMT):<br/>
Ah. That helps a lot
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 20:56:45 GMT):<br/>
api/* intended to be interfaces being used between the contents of pkg & def to keep things decoupled
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 20:59:47 GMT):<br/>
The problem in the interim is that the examples mostly point out the code within pkg/* (which is okay since this is more stablized), but the intention is to eventually point people to def/*
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 21:00:11 GMT):<br/>
def = default
</p>
<p><strong>bmatsuo</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 21:00:41 GMT):<br/>
Right. That makes sense
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 21:00:41 GMT):<br/>
so expanded out: default/fabricapi (aka fabricsdk)
</p>
<p><strong>bmatsuo</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 21:01:20 GMT):<br/>
I was thinking that def was "definition" or something
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 21:01:22 GMT):<br/>
We actually tried to find a recommend package structure for this :)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 21:01:29 GMT):<br/>
yeh sometimes I say definition or define
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 21:01:34 GMT):<br/>
partly why I liked def heh.
</p>
<p><strong>bmatsuo</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 21:01:44 GMT):<br/>
Default makes a little more sense to me
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 21:02:00 GMT):<br/>
so we saw the pkg/* convention somewhere and picked that up
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 21:02:20 GMT):<br/>
normally these directory structure have a cmd/<binary>
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 21:02:37 GMT):<br/>
but an SDK doesn't have that so you can basically see "def" as corresponding to "cmd"
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 21:03:19 GMT):<br/>
and api is a bit of an oddity but didn't want folders at the same level depending on each other basically.
</p>
<p><strong>bmatsuo</strong> (Fri, 28 Jul 2017 21:03:41 GMT):<br/>
Yea. I supposed that makes enough sense :)

</p>
<p><strong>bmatsuo</strong> (Sat, 29 Jul 2017 22:52:45 GMT):<br/>
If it didn't force all my repos depending on the SDK to use it for flattening purposes that would be OK too.

<p><strong>bmatsuo</strong> (Sat, 29 Jul 2017 22:55:05 GMT):<br/>
grpc uses a magic variable to ensure API compatibility between generated code and the grpc library -- when the grpc library changes the magic variable has its name changed to break old clients. Could fabric and fabric-sdk-go do something similar to ensure that the fabric repo is checked out at a revision compatible with version of fabric-sdk-go that is in use?

@passkit indeed. Tiered vendor directories could be more manageable if govendor behaved in a way that was a little easier to reason about and work with. At the same time, disregarding bugs and strange semantic differences between the various govendor commands, by flattening vendored dependencies govendor is trying to solve a problem that does not have a solution given the constraints Go development presents (that is, without required semantic versioning or forced backward compatibility you cannot correctly resolve the diamond dependency problem).

Can someone explain why the eventhub connection is disconnected after each invoke, and precisely what is happening in the eventHub.grpcClient.UnregisterAsync call?
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 16:31:21 GMT):<br/>
This call appears to be terminating the connection prematurely (I.e. before the event message has been received).
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 17:24:43 GMT):<br/>
@vinitesh that method returns a protobuf. You can use proto.Unmarshal()
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 17:28:47 GMT):<br/>
@passkit eventHub.Disconnect will unregister for all registered events and close the grpc stream.
It should only be called after the expected event is received. Can you provide some more info on your usage?
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 17:30:33 GMT):<br/>
But in the SDK, during invoke, you check it eventhub is connected (and connect if not), then immediately defer a disconnect
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 17:30:50 GMT):<br/>
I fear that this disconnect is firing before the event is returnd
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 17:32:29 GMT):<br/>
Can you point me to the method you are using?
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 17:32:51 GMT):<br/>
`fabricTxn.InvokeChaincode`
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 17:33:21 GMT):<br/>
Contains this:
```
if eventHub.IsConnected() == false {
		err = eventHub.Connect()
		if err != nil {
			return nil, apitxn.TransactionID{}, fmt.Errorf("Error connecting to eventhub: %v", err)
		}
		defer eventHub.Disconnect()
	}
```
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 17:35:39 GMT):<br/>
That helper method blocks for 30 seconds before disconnecting. It is very unlikely that the commit event would take that long
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 17:36:34 GMT):<br/>
Agree - but if I remove `defer eventHub.Disconnect()` the method is rock solid.  If I keep it, then it is intermittently failing

</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 17:41:14 GMT):<br/>
I don't see a relation to disconnect. Deferred statements are only called after the method returns. So that would happen regardless of a timeout.

These two transactions were initiated from separate pods in the same kubernetes application
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 18:39:48 GMT):<br/>
As mentioned - when removing the disconnect, all events are caught.  However that gives me another problem in that my pods quickly run out of network resources.
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 18:55:50 GMT):<br/>
Would someone be able to explain the background (problem and how this change fixed it) to commit 1e9e2f0?  Before this commit, events would arrive, but would take a very long time (~15 seconds), but would consistently arrive.  After this commit, then events either arrive instantly, or not at all.
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 18:58:38 GMT):<br/>
The Jira issue and the commit message have literally no information
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 19:30:15 GMT):<br/>
@passkit This was done for consistency. We register and unregister asynchronously at all other places in the event hub. Additionally, this was more of a courtesy message to the peer to unregister events before closing the stream and it doesn't really make sense to synchronously wait for a response.
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 19:31:56 GMT):<br/>
Can you add a test case that demonstrates the issue you describe? We use the event hub is several of our test cases and have not noticed this behaviour
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 19:35:46 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure that I can.  As it sometimes works and sometimes fails.  If it were consistently replicatable, then a test case would be possible.
</p>
<p><strong>passkit</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 19:37:10 GMT):<br/>
The problem (and relates to the main Fabric project also), is that these test cases all run locally - I've yet to see proper testing against a remote network.

Also, would it be possible to return the result from `fabricTxn.QueryChaincode` as a raw byte array (as with theInvoke function).  When the result of a query contains JSON data, casting it as a string escapes the quotes which causes marshalling of the result string to fail.  Are you modelling your data as JSON in your tests?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=NyyQvcvbhEYefwTtB) @divyank Thanks Divyank. I am able to unmarshal Payload but how to decode the actual data from it?
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 13:13:01 GMT):<br/>
@vinitesh The `ProcessedTransaction` contains an `Envelope` object which contains all the transaction information. You can take a look at the fabric transaction validation as an example on how to interpret these objects: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/v1.0.0/core/common/validation/msgvalidation.go#L357
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 13:17:46 GMT):<br/>
@passkit You can use `channel.SendTransactionProposal` to access the raw byte response. The helper methods in the fabric-txn package are mostly for beginners or simple use cases and make a lot of assumptions about usage. We anticipate that most users will use the fabric-client interfaces which provide more control.

@divyank I'm also trying to extract the data from the Payload returned from `QueryTransaction(txID)`.  The raw `ProcessedTransaction` payload contains the transaction data, but the envelope object inside does not.  The validation method you refer too returns an invalid signature and empty payload when given a `ProcessedTransaction` protobuf.

I just checked the code in the test/integration/end_to_end_test.go.

There are some errors, which are worth mentioning, to avoid any other going through the same issue:
Line 21: it should be &BaseSetupImpl instead of BaseSetupImpl
Line 49: it should be err = moveFunds(testSetup), there is an extra '&' before 'testSetup' in the original code.

Does anybody have experience with setting up functionality to register new users with the fabric-go-sdk? All the example codes that I can find (and the ones that the repo refers to) use PreEnrolled users.. If anybody knows of any resource would be very happy to hear about it! :)

@rohitrocket .. at version 0, but got version 1 - this tells you that configuration changed (from version 0 to version 1) since you last read it, so you are not allowed to change it (as you would overwrite the changes that happened since your last read). What that exactly mean in your context is hard to tell without understanding what you want to do / what you are doing on the client side.

@jellevdp go-sdk doesn't support registration, only enrollment. Users have to be registered out of band (from the sdk point of view). I think other sdks do the same.
</p>
<p><strong>jellevdp</strong> (Thu, 03 Aug 2017 22:30:53 GMT):<br/>
Ok, got it - thanks @aleksandar.likic 
</p>
<p><strong>aneb</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 01:18:56 GMT):<br/>
@aleksandar.likic Isn't that what is happening in the unit test fabric_ca_test.go?  Registering and enrolling a new user by sending a RegistrationRequest through the caClient?  Or you mean it doesn't support registration in the sense that you need to store your user's details like password etc somewhere else? 
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 02:12:49 GMT):<br/>
@aneb @jellevdp My apologies, it seems that my mind wandered back in time when I was writing my answer:) Yes, dynamic registration is supported.
</p>
<p><strong>aneb</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 02:17:29 GMT):<br/>
@aleksandar.likic no problem. I am actually trying to implement that code as we speak so that's why I was a bit confused :)  
</p>
<p><strong>aneb</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 02:41:14 GMT):<br/>
Speaking of which, should I be able to use the generated preEnrolled Admin certs  for registering/enrolling new users when connecting to localhost:7054 but using a pem/cert CN of ca.org1.example.org... etc 　    I keep getting "certificate signed by unknown authority errors".   The strange thing is that the cert is working for all other actions like installing chaincode etc.   So it seems like the cert passes the fabric client authorization but not the fabric caClient.   

I noticed that the fabric-sdk-go unit tests are using the generated certs as well ,with a CN set to ca.org1.example instead of localhost and the only thing I need to do (like the unit tests) is to set the FABRIC_CA_SERVER_TLS_CERTFILE and FABRIC_CA_SERVER_TLS_KEYFILE vars to use the server_localhost certificate.  But that only fixed the client authorization, not the caClient.

Anyone else ran into this problem?

@jimthematrix @bretharrison For the log message `Failed to send transaction and get notifications within the timeout period.` out of Node.  Does this mean either the orderer rejected, or the event hub didn't send? Or does it strictly mean that the event hum didn't send?

I think it is not SDK you need a help with, you need to get familiar with operational aspects first, by following https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. The docs will tell you how to set up a network using fabric CLI tools. Once you understand all the concepts and how to do it using CLI, you can go back to SDK (node, go, ...) and ask "OK now, how do I do THIS with this SDK?" It seems to me you jumped into a bigger thing without covering the basics first. Maybe that's not true, just my feeling. Does this make sense?
</p>
<p><strong>rohitrocket</strong> (Sat, 05 Aug 2017 13:32:14 GMT):<br/>
No I covered the basics.
</p>
<p><strong>rohitrocket</strong> (Sat, 05 Aug 2017 13:32:28 GMT):<br/>
I spend a good amount of time exploring such functionalities using cli

<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Sat, 05 Aug 2017 13:33:50 GMT):<br/>
@rohitrocket regarding the roles, our sdk example uses orderer user, org admin, and org user, all in different roles, who can do different things.

<p><strong>rohitrocket</strong> (Sat, 05 Aug 2017 13:34:22 GMT):<br/>

@qqbxclboy looks like you are using sdk-java. This is sdk-go channel, cannot help you much. One thing I can say is that your client receives UNAVAILABLE from the peer (see gRPC status code).

@troyronda can you take a look at https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5675 for adding idmixer MSP to GO SDK? @manu will be contributing the code but would need your help with planning it out (hopefully this can be part of the 1.1 release), and if this is something you agree should be pursued for 1.1, how to plug it in

Hi,

I’m running my chain code successfully via de `Fabric-SDK-Go` and persist my data on `couchdb`; however, when I fiddle around in the chaincode (even as simple as just adding a comment) it gives me the error
```
Unable to install and instantiate the chaincode: SendInstantiateProposal Endorser localhost:7051 return error: Error calling endorser 'localhost:7051':  rpc error: code = Unknown desc = chaincode error (status: 500, message: chaincode exists mychaincode)
```
The only way to get it back to work again is
- to do a `git checkout mychaincode` and then everything runs as normal with my data intact, but without the changes in `mychaincode`.
- or  delete the `couchdb` directory, but then I lose all my data.

Any one with an idea to upgrade the chaicode when using persistence with couchdb?
Is there perhaps  `Fabric-sdk-go` functionality to do a chaincode `upgrade` (I haven’t found it)?


Thanks.

Hi,

I’m running my chain code successfully via de `Fabric-SDK-Go` and persist my data on couchdb; however, when I fiddle around in the chaincode (even as simple as just adding a comment) it gives me the error
```
Unable to install and instantiate the chaincode: SendInstantiateProposal Endorser localhost:7051 return error: Error calling endorser 'localhost:7051':  rpc error: code = Unknown desc = chaincode error (status: 500, message: chaincode exists mychaincode)
```
The only way to get it back to work again is
- to do a `git checkout mychaincode` and then everything runs as normal with my data intact. 
- or  delete the `couchdb` directory, but then I lose all my data.

Any one with an idea to upgrade the chaicode when using persistence with couchdb?
Is there perhaps  `Fabric-sdk-go` functionality to do a chaincode `upgrade` (I haven’t found it)?


Thanks.

Hi @habpygo when you update your chaincode, do you also upgrade the version of the chaincode ?
</p>
<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 10:48:33 GMT):<br/>
Hi @antitoine, yes but I also have to change the ChaincodeID — something that I don’t understand — and thus also change the CLEAN section of the `Makefile`.

By the way, I forgot to comment out all the goodies in the `Init` function in the chaincode, as is mentioned in the docs,  which resulted in my database from the old chaincode being wiped out. 

Any way, as usual, thanks for the pointers.
</p>
<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 14:00:21 GMT):<br/>
@habpygo I don't think that you need to change the chaincode ID, it is the only way for the SDK to know that there is already a chaincode installed with this ID.
You have no issue when you don't use CouchDB ?
</p>
<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Mon, 14 Aug 2017 15:49:05 GMT):<br/>
@antitoine no, without using CouchDB I don't have any issues at all except of course that I need to plug in the data for the `struct` every time I start. After that I can query the blockchain for all the keys or select the output for a specific key, or a range of keys. In any case for now I just leave the chaincode as is and focus on to transacting the struct (basically a personnel file instead of marbles) from a -> b -> c picking up attributes along the way.

I am actually running into the exact same problem. My chaincode installs,instantiates  and runs fine through the SDK but I am also getting the same error when trying to update the chaincode.  If I don't change any settings then I get the chaincode /var/hyperledger/production/chaincodes/myChaincode.v1.0.0 exists error which is normal.  However if I update my version number  and try to update(install) the chaincode I get the following error: chaincode exists myChaincode.  For me the problem is not couchdb related though as I am not using couchdb at the moment.  

At first I thought it was just something that is wrong with my chaincode so I did the same with the marbles02 demo chaincode and the exact same thing is happening.   I must be doing something wrong though as I am pretty sure at the very start of my project it worked a few times, although this problem started occurring pretty fast without any real change to the deploy/setup code. Using the fabric-txn/admin installCC and instantiateCC functions.

<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Tue, 15 Aug 2017 07:23:40 GMT):<br/>
@aneb perhaps some food for thought, although I myself have not tried it as I focus on other things now.
1. Check if the containers are all gone when you start anew. With me I have the problem that one container remains even after the `make clean` command thus forcing me to manually get rid of it.
2. When updating, comment everything in the `Init` function. I forgot to do this (stupidly) and thus my data were gone. So try
```
func (t *YourChaincode) Init(stub shim.ChaincodeStubInterface) pb.Response {
#
#
#
return shim.Success(nil) // otherwise just nil
```

As I said I haven’t tried it but perhaps it will work, meaning that you can update the chaincode just giving it another version number without losing your data in the process.

Does anyone know where I could start to help out developing this project? I looked for things to do regarding the fabric go SDK, but couldn't find anything on Jira. So I don't know if the project administration is done elsewhere, or if I'm just searching in the wrong way.
</p>
<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 13:56:24 GMT):<br/>
@arjanvaneersel I'm not a contributor, but I saw some functions with the "Not implemented yet" error. So, I think there is work to do. Nobody has talked about another project administration, except JIRA. Maybe open a JIRA to ask?
</p>
<p><strong>arjanvaneersel</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 14:00:12 GMT):<br/>
Must be doing something wrong in Jira then. Will browse there again.
</p>
<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 14:03:59 GMT):<br/>
Try with this search query: `project = FAB AND status = "To Do" AND text ~ "sdk go"`
</p>
<p><strong>arjanvaneersel</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 14:09:05 GMT):<br/>
@antitoine Yes, that actually returned some results. And at least enough of results to understand what I did wrong. Seems that fabric-sdk-go is the component. So I changed the query to: "project = FAB AND component = fabric-sdk-go" and now I get everything

</p>
<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 14:48:21 GMT):<br/>
@naumenkog Try with the integration tests (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/end_to_end_test.go) and the CLI example (https://github.com/securekey/fabric-examples/tree/master/fabric-cli/). But now, there are two tutorials:

- And this one: https://github.com/alexcrownus/fabcar
</p>
<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 14:49:23 GMT):<br/>

@antitoine although it's true that you can see how you can use the sdk, the current setup looks more than awful. If I'm not mistaken, in order to invoke chaincode to `func InvokeChaincode(client fab.FabricClient, channel fab.Channel, targets []apitxn.ProposalProcessor,
	eventHub fab.EventHub, chaincodeID string, fcn string, args []string, transientData map[string][]byte)`

<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 19:57:50 GMT):<br/>
I have a question about the tests/fixtures folder in the go sdk.

inside the docker-compose.yaml, for the ca1 service, there are two volumes:
      - ./channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/ca/:/etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server-config
      - ./tls/fabricca/certs/server:/etc/hyperledger/fabric-ca-server-config

And both of them map to the same path inside the container, but when I run docker-compose up, only one of those volumes gets copied inside the container.
Additionally, both external paths contain a file with the name ca.org1.example.com-cert.pem, but the two of them have different contents.

My question is, does anyone know what this is supposed to do?

@ivaylopivanov Yes, this is the one to use. I'm also surprise of the complexity. But it's really easy to abstract them if you use the same client, channel, peer... for every invokes.

I have created a new user using fabric-sdk-go and trying to access the chaincode methods but its giving error signed by unknown authority and also when creating users separately will it generate all the relevant user certificates required for interaction itself or will have to do it separately? 
</p>
<p><strong>alexcrownus</strong> (Fri, 18 Aug 2017 07:59:49 GMT):<br/>
@ivaylopivanov I can understand your point. Please note that the SDK is still in development and not released yet. But I can assure you it is getting better and better
</p>
<p><strong>alexcrownus</strong> (Fri, 18 Aug 2017 08:03:45 GMT):<br/>
For example, there was no fabrictxn.InvokeChaincode abstraction. Also, fabric-txn/admin package has been added to simplify chaincode and channel administration
</p>
<p><strong>alexcrownus</strong> (Fri, 18 Aug 2017 08:09:29 GMT):<br/>
@antitoine You can actually have any number of channels, peers, orderers etc, just manage them in your application and then call the invoke function with the right combination 
</p>
<p><strong>ivaylopivanov</strong> (Fri, 18 Aug 2017 18:01:19 GMT):<br/>

Hi,

Is it currently actually possible to upgrade chaincode through the SDK by way of only updating the version number?  I am a bit confused as I still keep running into the same problem of not being able to successfully do this.  Then it hit me though that currently all I am doing is running the install/instantiate code while the upgrade mechanism is supposed to be done via "peer chaincode upgrade".  Currently in the sdk source code I can't find any trace of an "upgrade" proptype being sent and he fabric source file proputils function CreateUpgradeProposalFromCDS doesn't have any usages.  Are other people just updating their chaincode by CLI and is this a WIP item or is it really supposed to work with install/instantiate and am I just looking at deprecated code? 

Thanks for any feedback or confirmation.

Quoting this unanswered question as I am running into the exact same problem.  After  I successfully register a new user, save user to the client state store, retrieve the user again from the state store, set the client user context to that retrieved user ,I invoke the chaincode and the "signed by unknown authority" is thrown.  Just feels like I am missing a step or should this supposed to be all the required steps for registering a new user to invoke chaincode with?

Hi,

I have a problem initializing the Fabric SDK. After creating and opening the KeyStore I get the following error message:
```
…
…
10:57:44.926 [bccsp_sw] DEBU :  KeyStore created at [/tmp/msp/keystore].
10:57:44.926 [bccsp_sw] DEBU :  KeyStore opened at [/tmp/msp/keystore]...done
10:57:44.926 [bccsp_p11] DEBU :  Loading pkcs11 library []
Unable to initialize the Fabric SDK: Error initializing SDK: Failed to initialize crypto suite [Could not initialize BCCSP PKCS11 [Failed initializing PKCS11 library  ForFabric [No PKCS11 library default]]]
panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
[signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x1 addr=0x98 pc=0x45e8d00]
```

I’ve tried to comment out the `BCCSP` part in the `config.yaml` file, but that gives this error message:
```
Environnement up
Start app ...
2017-08-25 11:28:15.504 CEST [fabric_sdk_go] InitConfigWithCmdRoot -> INFO 001 Using config file: config.yaml

panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
[signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x1 addr=0x0 pc=0x44157e7]
```

I’m using OS X and I see that I do not have the `/usr/local/Cellar/softhsm/2.1.0/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so` file (or path for that matter; it stops after the `Cellar` dir).

Any suggestions? 

Thanks.

<p><strong>biljana_lukovic</strong> (Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:16:48 GMT):<br/>
The transient data field of a proposal is a key-value store (Map).
It allows the client side to set various fields in it, and the chaincode side to easily retrieve one or more fields.
The transient data map is not saved in the ledger.

Hi, thanks for the solution; “SW” indeed did the job!

I have another problem that I can’t figure out. When I try to install the chaincode it gives me the error.
```
SendInstallProposal return error: InstallChaincode Endorser  returned error: Transaction processor (peer0.org1.example.com:7051) returned error 'context deadline exceeded' for txID '16314a6d5d6bb6becb145adad395a39a7e77beb08ca46b386878788cff2b8c0e'

```
I think the error can be traced back to the function
```
func SendInstallCC(client fab.FabricClient, chainCodeID string, chainCodePath string,
	chainCodeVersion string, chaincodePackage []byte, targets []fab.Peer, deployPath string) error {

…
…
for _, v := range transactionProposalResponse {
		if v.Err != nil {
			fmt.Println(“Error is probably here in line 47; endorser is: ", v.Endorser) // This returns an empty string
			return fmt.Errorf("InstallChaincode Endorser %s returned error: %v", v.Endorser, v.Err)
		}
```

Do you have any idea where I should look to resolve this? The tests all worked fine — exited with 0

Quoting this unanswered question as I am running into the exact same problem.  I can register and enroll new users without any issues whatsoever. However if I set this user as client context before invoke the chaincode the signed by unknown authority error is thrown.   Just feels like I am missing a step or should this work with no additional steps?

SendInstallProposal return error: InstallChaincode Endorser  returned error: Transaction processor (localhost:7051) returned error 'rpc error: code = ResourceExhausted desc = grpc: trying to send message larger than max (5035506 vs. 4194304)' for txID '6492e437113035a5b988d44ab9b072785d82fdfcd660136ad4778bafcbf9d51a'
```

The problem is that I can’t see any other ERROR messages, for example,  in the docker logs. Any idea what could be the problem?
Thanks.

@habpygo I ran into the same problem a while ago.  Are you vendoring in external packages by any chance into your chaincode that are quite large?  The chaincode gets packaged and sent to the orderer and there is a size limit.

why there is no release v1.0.0 ? 
</p>
<p><strong>baoyangc</strong> (Mon, 04 Sep 2017 03:25:47 GMT):<br/>
compared with fabric-sdk-java,is there any feature not completed in fabric-sdk-go ?
</p>
<p><strong>aneb</strong> (Mon, 04 Sep 2017 04:19:01 GMT):<br/>
@baoyangc  From my experience so far only one I know of is not being able to upgrade chain code with the sdk out of the box.    
</p>
<p><strong>baoyangc</strong> (Mon, 04 Sep 2017 06:10:40 GMT):<br/>
you mean: with fabric-sdk-java ,we can upgrade chaincode ?
</p>
<p><strong>aneb</strong> (Mon, 04 Sep 2017 06:25:22 GMT):<br/>
I haven't used the java sdk yet but it does have the UpgradeProposalRequest request class so I assume its possible. Also, the jira ticket for "sdk java upgrade chaincode support" is closed/completed. https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java/blob/master/src/main/java/org/hyperledger/fabric/sdk/UpgradeProposalRequest.java

@habpygo I am not sure if the actual message size limit can be altered. Probably its possible but would have to look into that.  What exactly are you adding to the chaincode? For example I ran into the same problems when I moved my chaincode to a standalone project and had to do govendor add +external to make my chaincode unit tests work.  However this created  a big sized vendor folder because of the hyperledger/fabric dependencies.  

The sdk basically just tars  your chaincode src folder and sends it so for me that was a no no.   For now I just moved my chaincode back into my main project (the one that uses the sdk) and I use the deployPath setting when installing the chaincode.   By doing that my unit tests just use the vendor folder of my main project and for the actual chaincode external packages I have a separate vendor folder inside my chaincode src folder.    So when installing the chaincode only the vendor folder in the chaincode src folder is included and all the rest is ignored.  For example to include ffjson.    

Of course that was my situation. If you actually have a really big vendor folder with non related fabric stuff then there is not much you can do except for changing the message size limit or try to make your vendor folder small.

@aneb, yes that ''…when I moved my chaincode to a standalone project and had to do govendor add +external to make my chaincode unit tests work. However this created a big sized vendor folder because of the hyperledger/fabric dependencies.'' is exactly my problem! The size of the `vendor` folder is about 18MB, almost four times the allowed size.
I’ll try some of your suggestions and see if it works. Thanks a million so far @aneb; this whole issue was driving me nuts! ... and it still is!

Hi @aneb, sorry to bother you again, but just for me to clarify.
I have a dir structure as follows `$GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger` in the `hyperledger folder` reside the `fabric` , `fabric-ca` and `fabric-sdk-go` folders. Would you suggest to move `myproject` in the `hyperledger` folder without `govendor`ing?
</p>
<p><strong>aneb</strong> (Mon, 04 Sep 2017 09:13:24 GMT):<br/>
My dir structure is actually as follows   $GOPATH/src/local-gitbucket-ip/myProject/server       inside myProject/server i have my go server code that uses the sdk.  so inside this folder I do govendor add +external to prepare for fabric sdk usage. This fills up the vendor folder for my server project so I can use the sdk.   Inside my myProject root folder I have a sub folder  fixtures/src/myProject/chaincode. Inside this folder I put my chaincode and unit tests and a vendor folder with in my case ffjson only.    When you use the sdk helper functions to install chaincode you can use the "deployPath" setting.  Basically what this does is set a new ,temporary, GOPATH setting.  So my new deployPath setting is ./fixtures which makes the sdk copy and install the path  ./fixtures/src/myProject/chaincode folder.    I actually prefer a separate folder/project for my chaincode but because of the dependency misery I put that on hold for a while and just do it like this. I am pretty sure there is a better way to handle this.

<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Mon, 04 Sep 2017 10:37:07 GMT):<br/>
So, this would mean that you have a file structure like this, right?
```
└── local-gitbucket-ip
    └── myProject
        ├── fixtures
        │   └── src
        │       └── myProject
        │           └── chaincode
        │               ├── myProjectChainCode.go
        │               └── vendor
        └── server
            ├── gofile1.go
            ├── gofile2.go
            └── vendor
```
Two questions:
1. I assume that you have all the other `fixtures` stuff (like the `channel` folder and the `docker-compose.yaml` file in the fixtures folder as depicted above as well?
2. You would then run the `go build` command from the `myProject` root folder just below the `local-gitbucket-ip` folder right?
</p>
<p><strong>aneb</strong> (Mon, 04 Sep 2017 13:18:38 GMT):<br/>
actually in my project the fixtures folder is inside the server folder.

How to update a instantiated chaincode in fabric doe we have to install and instantiate again or just installing the chaincode will work ? 
</p>
<p><strong>aneb</strong> (Wed, 06 Sep 2017 11:46:09 GMT):<br/>
@ranjan008 you update chaincode by running the peer chaincode upgrade command. Currently not supported by the go sdk though. Need to do this manually with the CLI or use the java or node sdk.

I might take a shot at it myself though because while there isn't really a helper function for it right now in the sdk, you can sort of follow the install and instantiate request and just copy/modify it to create the upgrade request.  Haven't gotten around it yet though.

@ranjan008 I take back what I said about not being able to send upgrade cc request with the go sdk. Like I said the helper functions aren't there but fixing this only requires a bit of copy pasting.  In txsender.go (fabric-sdk-go code) you just copy the SendInstantiateProposal function and rename it to SendUpgradeProposal function. Inside this function you call protos_utils.CreateUpgradeProposalFromCDS instead of protos_utils.CreateDeployUpgradeProposalFromCDS and that is it.   You just have to have to work your way up to transactionconfig.go to provide all the necessary helper/wrapper functions to the top.  Of course you are editing your vendoring in package this way. You might also be able to just copy all this code to your own project.

Hi @aneb,  coming back to the discussion on the ERROR message below:
```
SendInstallProposal return error: InstallChaincode Endorser  returned error: Transaction processor (localhost:7051) returned error 'rpc error: code = ResourceExhausted desc = grpc: trying to send message larger than max (5035506 vs. 4194304)' for txID '6492e437113035a5b988d44ab9b072785d82fdfcd660136ad4778bafcbf9d51a'
```
The size of the file didn’t matter in the end! The problem is the `PATH` to the chaincode. I was having problems with finding the right path to the `chaincode.go` file  due to the code snippet `deployPath` which plunks a `src` dir at the end of the path. So it had nothing to do with the size of the chaincode or `vendor` dir.

How on earth does a developer debug his code when error messages set him/her on the wrong path (pun intended), you may ask. Answer: I can’t remember, but there was a whole lot of #!*(%$# going on behind my desk I can assure you that.

@habpygo  I am glad you were able to fix the problem.  I finally moved my chaincode to a separate project/folder as well.  In my case the message larger than max ... error was correct though. A too big vendor folder because of the fabric dependencies. Now I just do go/src/myproject/chaincode-go/vendor -> contains fabric hyperledger  and go/src/myproject/chaincode-go/src/chaincode is where the actual code resides (including another vendor folder for dependencies like ffjson or basically anything). When deploying I then just set my gopath temporarily to go/src/myproject/chaincode-go so the main vendor folder will be skipped.  Another solution would be to just move all my unit test code to a separate project folder like src/myproject/chaincode-go-test to avoid all of these dependency issues. However soon you will be required to vendor in the shim package as well, was in 1.0.2 release notes, so from then I think you will see a "recommended" way of doing it because  I can guarantee that will cause the same dependency issues.　　It is also possible I am just doing something wrong and you just need to find the correct directory structure/paths to avoid any dependency issues as you mentioned.

Hi @aneb, I’m not sure which is the right answer to this problem. Both solutions seem to work; however, I’m still a bit confused by this particular error message and it was by debugging line by line (with `fmt.Println(—)` statements) that I saw that the `PATH`  to the `chaincode` contained a `src/src` directory. By pruning one of them it finally worked.  In any case let’s keep ourselves, and this channel of course, informed on this issue as we move on. 
Anyway, as always, thanks for your help. Much appreciated!

Hi guys ! 
I'm wondering if a transaction storage has been implemented, let me explain :
The client tries to send data to a peer. Unfortunately, it has some connection problem so these transaction haven't been sent until the timeout expires.
A week later, the connection problem is resolved and I would like all transaction that failed within the week to be sent again (the transactions are automated).
Is there currently an easy way in that sdk that enables me to do that, or should I have to find some other way?
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 15:24:26 GMT):<br/>
@ArvsIndrarys Sorry, the SDK cannot queue and retry transactions later. For this scenario, you would normally use some messaging provider and configure a persistent queue that would hold the messages and redeliver (to a consumer that transacts with fabric) periodically until messages are consumed.
</p>
<p><strong>ArvsIndrarys</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 16:29:00 GMT):<br/>
Too bad, that would have avoided me some code.
Thanks @aleksandar.likic !

I have another question, trying to run integration tests of the sdk with latest sources results in:

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=9JRDZQqEDMkWgWHyZ) @enigma send a tx in chaincodes.
</p>
<p><strong>aneb</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 07:23:50 GMT):<br/>
After making progress and understanding the whole TLS setup more I am still unable to get newly enrolled users to invoke chaincode. and the following error is thrown : 'rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Failed to deserialize creator identity, err The supplied identity is not valid, Verify() returned x509: certificate signed by unknown authority' for proposal:`

I must note that I am not working with the default peerOrg1 ... example.com setup anymore and created my own network. Especially for trying to figure out all of the different CA and TLS settings. 


Steps I have taken:
```
- created my own ca_root.pem and ca_root-key.pem
- created my wildcard CA(for localhost testing) and client-fabric-client(-key).pem signed with my own ca_root.pem
- use this wildcard CA in docker-compose as the FABRIC_CA_SERVER_TLS_CERT(KEY)FILE settings
- have all the necessary /etc/host mappings to 127.0.0.1
- until this part everything works fine. I can register, enroll, revoke users when using the CA connection URL"https://ca_Peer###:7054"
- before invoking chaincode I run `setup.Client.SetUserContext(user)` with user being the enrolledUser
- after  sender.SendTransaction(tx) is called the earlier metioned error is thrown.
```

It really feels that I am missing something here. When using pre enrolled peer users everything works fine (admin and normal user) so I decided to check what is different between the two.  The Issuer for the pregenerated certs is set to ca.<org>.<domain>.com while the generated issuer is set to fabric-ca-user (because of the ca server config CSR settings). Shouldn't these generated certs contain an ORG reference?


Anyone that has any idea what I might be missing here or what might be going wrong?

It is the only remaining issue I need to figure out before I can start with AWS/Bluemix.

Thank you.

@enigma did you add 127.0.0.1 ca_peerOrg1  to your host file?  Before this wasn't necessary as the used localhost:7054 as a connection string including a server certifcate with a DNS for localhost. However now they use ca_peerOrg1 in the connection url so you need to redirect it.

would I also have to make a redirect for each chaincode container that gets deployed as one of the few tests that still fails on the integration test calls

and the integration test itself is able to invoke the chaincode
</p>

just fine with my hosts file

probably because the one is called docker internally and the other is called outside as the port mapping suggests

If I create a user like so:

	// Register a user
	registerRequest := ca.RegistrationRequest{
		Name:        userName,
		Type:        "user",
		Affiliation: "org1.department1",
		CAName:      caConfig.Name,
	}
	enrolmentSecret, err := caClient.Register(adminUser, &registerRequest)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Errorf("Error from Register: %s", err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("Registered User: %s, Secret: %s\n", userName, enrolmentSecret)

and if I set and  load it to/from statestore subsequently and try to invoke the example_cc chaincode on mychannel with that user it fails silently (no error but also no invocation) I assume that my user does not have the appriate role/policy to invoke the chaincode on that channel or do anything else on the peer. How can I add a role to this type user so it will be able to interact with the channel and chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>enigma</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 16:33:48 GMT):<br/>
it works with the utils.go user1 getDefaultImplPreEnrolledUser

	org1User, err := GetUser(sc, "org1", setup.OrgID)
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("Error getting org user: %v", err)
	}

	sc.SetUserContext(org1User)

fetching the signcerts from the pre-enrolled user test/fixtures/channel/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/User1@org1.example.com
but why not with my created user?
</p>
<p><strong>aneb</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 16:35:03 GMT):<br/>
@enigma  if there really is no error or it fails silently then something else must be wrong. I am actually running into the exact same problem at the moment but in my case it clearly throws an error saying that the identity couldn't be validated.

<p><strong>enigma</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 16:39:47 GMT):<br/>

func GetUser(c fab.FabricClient, orgPath string, orgName string) (ca.User, error) {

it clearly consumes a signcert next ti the msp/keystore aka tmp/enrolled_user (I guess)

@vdods I don't think there is any at the moment.   The code is commented  pretty well so for example you could run `godoc -http=:6060` , access localhost:6060 and go through the docs like that.  Although to be honest you might as well just go through the code as it will feel exactly the same.  Example code on how to use the Fabric CA client can be found here though https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/fabric_ca_test.go.

@ganbold I just tried with the latest and it worked. I started fresh, to avoid problems with environment: go get -u github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go, then cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/, then make depend-install, then make - and it all worked fine. I am using mac with go version go1.8.3 darwin/amd64

The Problem is that the `context, err := sdk.NewContext("org1msp")` call has to use a lower case key `org1msp`. I used `Org1MSP` as in my yaml file, but after a lot of debugging, the map only contains lower case keys

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 20 Sep 2017 13:57:59 GMT):<br/>
(github.com/op/go-logging needs upstream patching due to data races - so either the SDK switches to a new logging solution or needs to internalize this library)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 20 Sep 2017 13:58:36 GMT):<br/>
cfssl isn't expected to be vendoring by downstream applications, so it might be better to internalize than vendor

Hi guys do you have any suggestions how to solve this.
I want to iterate over all the transaction id’s (TxID) on the blockchain and extract the Key/Value pairs belonging to the different TxID’s. I can iterate over all the Keys and get the Value and TxID for each Key, but that’s not what I want.

Looking at the marbles example, we can query “a” and extract the Value; so if “a” starts out at 100, buys 100 and then sells 50, we only see the Value for “a” (150) and the TxID for the last transaction, while I would like to see this:
```
TxID		Key 		Value
1607f… 		a		100
967f2…		a		200
e03bc…		a		150

```

Any idea which function/method to use?

@alexcrownus @Hundredwz  I'm guessing the issue is that the SDK is currently assuming $GOPATH/bin is in your path
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 22 Sep 2017 13:44:20 GMT):<br/>
make depend-install does attempt to install the tools, and then checks if it can find them

make depend only does the check

Dear all, I am working on fabric1.0 release version in the corporate proxy network, may I know if it is possible to run the fabric-sdk-go inside a container instead of the host machine? This is because my corporate network does not allow me to successfully configure the fabric environment in the host machine. So I plan to use an official docker container (eg., hyperledger/fabric-peer) from fabric to accommodate the sdk. Thanks for any hints provided !

would anybody know how I can forward requests to my peer and orderer hostnames as defined in config-test.yaml if it is running on the docker host of a remote ip address: it defines the hostnames like so:
    host: "orderer.example.com"
    port: 7050

I asked in the chat why I initially got a bad tls handshake and somebody told me I have to put this into the /etc/hosts file

127.0.0.1       ca_peerOrg1
127.0.0.1       ca_peerOrg2
127.0.1.1       peer0.org1.example.com
127.0.1.1       orderer.example.com

now the config.yaml can digest those, however my follow-up situation seems different now as I have the ares server ip in that sdk-go config.yaml file to reach the remote hfc from my local go-sdk I define it like so:

  orderer0:
    host: "78.162.115.298"
    port: 7050

but that gives me bad tls handshake on like in this example:

which is from the coreos machine.
Would you potentially know how I can call that ip and have it interpreted as done with the /etc/hosts file locally or any suggestions of the same?
how to have the hostname match the common name of the certificate that is signed to orderer.example.com and not 78.162.115.298

would anybody know how I can forward requests to my peer and orderer hostnames as defined in config-test.yaml if it is running on the docker host of a remote ip address: it defines the hostnames like so:
    host: "orderer.example.com"
    port: 7050

I asked in the chat why I initially got a bad tls handshake running everything locally and somebody told me I have to put this into the /etc/hosts file

127.0.0.1       ca_peerOrg1
127.0.0.1       ca_peerOrg2
127.0.1.1       peer0.org1.example.com
127.0.1.1       orderer.example.com

now the config.yaml can digest those, however my follow-up situation seems different now as I need the hyperledger docker host ip to be reachable from my local go-sdk : sth like:

  orderer0:
    host: "78.162.115.298"
    port: 7050

but that gives me bad tls handshake on like in this example:
ca_peerOrg1               | 2017/09/25 16:02:28 http: TLS handshake error from 78.162.115.298:51724: remote error: tls: bad certificate.
Would anybody potentially know how I can call that ip and have it interpreted as done with the /etc/hosts file locally or any suggestions of the same?
how to have the hostname match the common name of the certificate that is signed to orderer.example.com and not 78.162.115.298.

Hello guys, in case of latest update and vendoring fabric packages I have a problem with using function called IsConfigBlock() from fabric/protos/utils/commonutils.go
Because it placed in "internal" folder I cant import it, and i can't use utils package without vendoring because Block struct is vendored
Any advices? Thanks
</p>

@AlexanderEx123 - @bstasyszyn was looking into a similar issue today - let me check with him tomorrow
</p>

(he is updating the CLI example to use the updated SDK and was making a list of what needs to be outside internal)
</p>
<p><strong>aneb</strong> (Tue, 26 Sep 2017 01:07:12 GMT):<br/>
@enigma Maybe it is a tls mismatch for your CA server.  Which FABRIC_CA_SERVER_TLS_CERTFILE setting are you using at the moment?

Hi guys, I'm testing the balance-transfer example on ubuntu machine. I docerized node.js API in order to interact with fabric from remote app. I have exposed port 4000 on node.js and made a bridge with outside port to access node. Node.js uses JWS tokens for security. Yesterday I could execute sample REST API requests (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/master/balance-transfer#sample-rest-apis-requests) locally from command line. For example I could register/enroll user in the network, create channel, etc. However with the Postman toll I was getting errors like: Error: ECONNREFUSED localhost:8054, ECONNREFUSED localhost:7054, depends what user token I was using for request. That is my first problem.

The second problem came today, when jwt token was expired and it is normal, since it is configured that way (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/master/balance-transfer/config.json). But what I couldn't understand is that I even can not authenticate new user from localhost with cli. For instance, this login request doesn't return anything, it's not executing: curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4000/users -H "content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d 'username=Jim&orgName=org1'

If any of you already faced the same issue please guide me. Thank you in advance!

func NewSDK(options Options) (*FabricSDK, error) {
	// Construct SDK opts from the quick access options in setup
	sdkOpts := opt.SDKOpts{

The `NewSDK` function ALWAYS includes a config File. Previously it was possible to configure it by implementing the `apiconfig.Config` interface and not using the configFile.
How to do this in the current master version?

<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 17:37:12 GMT):<br/>
@enigma Transient data is data that your chaincode needs for endorsement (e.g. as computational parameters), but you don't want it to end up in the ledger. Unlike non-transient data, it's seen only by the endorsers of that transaction - it's not saved anywhere by fabric.

@AlexanderEx123 I had similar error messages in the past (even though I wasn't using the fabric-sdk-go). In my case it meant that I didn't send a properly setup update transaction to the Orderer. Did you send the whole Envelope object or just the actual Config? If you sent the whole Envelope as the Config field of the `CreateChannelRequest`, that could explain your problem.

this is how i get ConfigUpdate
</p>
<p><strong>LeoKotschenreuther</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 22:11:43 GMT):<br/>
@AlexanderEx123 yes, I just realized that asking about the `CreateChannelRequest` doesn't make much sense :D
Are you getting that error when you try to get the ConfigUpdate or when you send the ConfigUpdate to the Orderer?
</p>
<p><strong>AlexanderEx123</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 22:12:36 GMT):<br/>
after calling CreateChannel method
</p>
<p><strong>AlexanderEx123</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 22:12:55 GMT):<br/>
getting ConfigUpdate seems ok
</p>
<p><strong>LeoKotschenreuther</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 22:14:58 GMT):<br/>
Since you're trying to update a channel, is calling the CreateChannel method really the right one to call? Again, I haven't used the go-sdk much.
</p>
<p><strong>AlexanderEx123</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 22:17:59 GMT):<br/>
yep, inside method if Config is passed where is no create, but update action perfom
</p>
<p><strong>LeoKotschenreuther</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 22:18:19 GMT):<br/>
Hi everybody, I have a question about creating channels:
In the [definition of the `CreateChannelStruct`](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/2fb94846c7d69325ab682c7568bb8bcad69b94d8/api/apifabclient/fabricclient.go#L56) there is a comment about the `Config` attribute that says that one could also use a `buildChannelConfig()` method which is supposedly in the same package.

I couldn't find that method at all in the fabric-go-sdk with the Github Search, does this method exist?
</p>
<p><strong>AlexanderEx123</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 22:19:06 GMT):<br/>
no
</p>
<p><strong>AlexanderEx123</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 22:19:18 GMT):<br/>
i think it was copy paste from node sdk
</p>
<p><strong>LeoKotschenreuther</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 22:26:32 GMT):<br/>
@AlexanderEx123 So far I have only used the configtxlator and the cli to perform channel updates (following [these instructions](http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configtxlator.html). One thing you could try is to make sure that your ConfigUpdate looks good. After you get it back from the Configtxlator, you could decode the ConfigUpdate to a JSON with the Configtxlator again.
</p>
<p><strong>LeoKotschenreuther</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 22:26:56 GMT):<br/>
You will see the difference between a proper ConfigUpdate and one that didn't work out.
</p>
<p><strong>LeoKotschenreuther</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 22:27:52 GMT):<br/>
Unfortunatley the Configtxlator doesn't tell you right away if the ConfigUpdate didn't work. It only encodes an error message in the ConfigUpdate which you will only see if you decode the ConfigUpdate to JSON again.
</p>
<p><strong>AlexanderEx123</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 22:46:48 GMT):<br/>
thanks, so configtxlator can not decode my ConfigUpdate
</p>
<p><strong>AlexanderEx123</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 23:38:00 GMT):<br/>
okay, i fix my problem, but now i see this:
</p>

@aleksandar.likic I have read that. if I have one v1.0.0 fabric network and one v1.0.2 fabric network. could I set a version in code, such that I can switch in v1.0.0 and v1.0.2
</p>
<p><strong>enigma</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 10:46:10 GMT):<br/>
fabric-sdk uses an internal package in its integration base-setup.go for defining chaincodePolicy (	"github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/internal/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/common/cauthdsl"
) passing it as argument to admin.SendInstantiateCC(setup.Channel, chainCodeID, args, chainCodePath, chainCodeVersion, chaincodePolicy, []apitxn.ProposalProcessor{setup.Channel.PrimaryPeer()}, setup.EventHub). How am I supposed to make use of internal package to call SendInstantiateCC???

Hi @troyronda @aleksandar.likic  - we're using the sdk to register and enroll new users and consequently invoking transactions with these newly generated users. However, we experience issues with the validity of the new identities when connecting to the eventHub with these new users. 
```Initialize return error: Failed eventHub.Connect() [Error from eventsClient.Start (rpc error: code = Unknown desc = event message must be properly signed by an identity from the same organization as the peer: [failed deserializing event creator: [The supplied identity is not valid, Verify() returned x509: certificate signed by unknown authority]])]```
Any idea where we should be looking? Invocations with the pre-enrolled user work fine against the same peer.

@troyronda from the example you just posted, the user1 is hardcoded in. If I would want to replace that with a user that I register and enroll and put in the StateStore, it should work right? (cq, that functionality is currently supported in the SDK?)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 02 Oct 2017 18:35:27 GMT):<br/>
the example is part of the e2e tests - you can use whatever usernames you need.
</p>
<p><strong>jellevdp</strong> (Mon, 02 Oct 2017 18:37:10 GMT):<br/>
Ok, we're trying this for some time now but must not get something right with the certs and the signing of them because we get the following error:  ```Initialize return error: Failed eventHub.Connect() [Error from eventsClient.Start (rpc error: code = Unknown desc = event message must be properly signed by an identity from the same organization as the peer: [failed deserializing event creator: [The supplied identity is not valid, Verify() returned x509: certificate signed by unknown authority]])]```

</p>
<p><strong>jellevdp</strong> (Mon, 02 Oct 2017 18:40:05 GMT):<br/>
this is best interpreted then as a mismatch in certs from our implementation? Or are we still dependent on development of functionality in the SDK for this?

@troyronda thanks, but what I am missing is the output of the methods, i.e. you call the methods but don’t use the return. Could you please let me know how to get readable/usable output. I can query for the Height of the blockchain, but the data gives me gibberish. For example could you show me how I can use
```
// Test Query Block - retrieve block by number
	block, err = channel.QueryBlock(1)
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("QueryBlock return error: %v", err)
	}

// show block.data  if possible or show me how to do that.

@habpygo @troyronda Take a look the example fabric-cli: https://github.com/securekey/fabric-examples/tree/master/fabric-cli/. There are query commands that print out the block in a readable way (or in JSON format). For example: $ ./fabric-events-cli query block --num 2
</p>
<p><strong>bstasyszyn</strong> (Mon, 02 Oct 2017 19:54:12 GMT):<br/>
.. gives you output that looks like this:

@bstasyszyn @troyronda I have been trying to fiddle around with the packages from the https://github.com/securekey/fabric-examples/tree/master/fabric-cli link, but I’m getting errors during building like “can’t use three variables for two parameters…” or something along those lines — can’t remember exactly what it was. This smells like version differences. Just to make sure, what versions are you guys using. I’m using:
```
Fabric v1.0.1
Fabric-ca v1.0.0
Fabric-sdk-go (latest clone — master) 
go version go1.9 darwin/amd64
```

Could this be a problem?

By the way @bstasyszyn , the packages in your repository are awesome! Is there a possibility that @troyronda is going/allowed to incorporate this in the sdk as well?
</p>
<p><strong>bstasyszyn</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:31:08 GMT):<br/>
@habpygo The example is currently compatible fabric 1.0.0, fabric-ca 1.0.0 and fabric-sdk-go at master:110bf21bf3ab0a9a084f46d9698e1daeeda68a59. I'm actively working on making it compatible with the latest SDK - should be done in a few days.
</p>
<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:56:00 GMT):<br/>
@bstasyszyn super! By the way, perhaps you could immediately fix it for the latest commit, because I see that @troyronda has changed the `args` from `[]string` to `[][]byte` 
Again, thanks a lot.

@troyronda I am able to create new users using sdk and the keys files are being generated inside msp directory which is again under tmp directory of the system. the problem is whenever I am restarting my system the msp directory is getting deleted and the setup throws ski error where can i change the location for the msp directory.

Hey, one question. when using the cryptogen tool. How to set the ca client key and certificate in the go sdk?
</p>
<p><strong>samwood</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 00:44:55 GMT):<br/>
is it possible to retrieve all the peers via the go sdk? I imagine this requires interfacing with the gossip protocol ?

@troyronda  - can we close https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5917  ?
</p>
<p><strong>ranjan008</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 06:43:55 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda  is there any method in sdk which is being called everytime a block is inserted into the network?

<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 09:41:22 GMT):<br/>
how to invoke a special chaincode by its version?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 10:29:06 GMT):<br/>
As far as I can see, The Version field is not used in ```// create invocation spec to target a chaincode with arguments
	ccis := &pb.ChaincodeInvocationSpec{ChaincodeSpec: &pb.ChaincodeSpec{
		Type: pb.ChaincodeSpec_GOLANG, ChaincodeId: &pb.ChaincodeID{Name: request.ChaincodeID},
		Input: &pb.ChaincodeInput{Args: argsArray}}}``` (`ChaincodeId: &pb.ChaincodeID{Name: request.ChaincodeID},`)

Is there an open Pull Request or is this planned in the near future?

Could someone take a look at my 3 questions above? (ca cert, chaincode version, QueryBySystemChaincode)
</p>
<p><strong>ScottMoynes</strong> (Thu, 19 Oct 2017 21:08:40 GMT):<br/>
I wonder if it is possible to get the chaincode error from a client of the SDK, ie. if a chaincode calls `shim.Error("CHAINCODE ERROR)` can a caller of, say, `ChannelClient.QueryWithOpts()` retrieve the error message?
unwrapping the error gives a `TransactionProposalError` with an go error field `Err` and a value of type `status.statusError`. 
calling `Error()` on that gives something like "rpc error: code = Unknown desc = chaincode error (status: 500, message: CHAINCODE ERROR)". but `gprc/status` package is vendored and that type is not exported so i'm a bit stuck.
if it isnt possible, is it an enhancement that would be considered if i volunteered the effort?
Thanks! :smiley_cat:

</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 23 Oct 2017 08:33:45 GMT):<br/>
So - I changed my path variable to look into the default bin directory of $GOPATH in my case /tts/official/bin then atleast the `make depend-install` completed without errors.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 23 Oct 2017 09:32:55 GMT):<br/>
So - another change i had to do was to map my fabric-go-sdk directory in the docker prefereces - shared folders. 
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 23 Oct 2017 09:33:03 GMT):<br/>
After that all tests passed successfully.
</p>
<p><strong>Amjadnz</strong> (Mon, 23 Oct 2017 09:33:31 GMT):<br/>
So minor change in documentation can make this process more smooth for Mac Users.

hi, anyone know what version of fabric is the sdk-go supporting now? from the doc, master branch already supports fabric 1.0.1?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 01:38:44 GMT):<br/>
@baohua the CI is testing against 1.0.3.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 01:39:06 GMT):<br/>
so the master branch should support 1.0.3 now?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 01:39:12 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 01:39:20 GMT):<br/>
thanks, troyronda!
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 01:39:33 GMT):<br/>
No problem :)
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 01:40:18 GMT):<br/>
And do u think it should work with 1.0.2, too?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 01:40:29 GMT):<br/>
It should

great, thanks

<p><strong>warm3snow</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 02:26:32 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda I think `dep` can't import packages from GOPATH.  Why change `govendor` to `dep`? 
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 02:27:55 GMT):<br/>
Dep downloads packages and places them into vendor
</p>
<p><strong>warm3snow</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 02:28:09 GMT):<br/>
I have all the necessary pkgs locally, but the `dep` still fetch from the Internet.  Actually, i can not visit some pkg sites.

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 02:37:23 GMT):<br/>
The SDK is using vendor as normal so as long as the packages are in gopath or vendor folder, it should work

</p>
<p><strong>biljana_lukovic</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 13:22:48 GMT):<br/>
Depends on library and architecture; ‘Fabric-sdk-go’ was tested with ‘softhsm2’. The library path was set as: 
library: "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so, /usr/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so ,/usr/lib/s390x-linux-gnu/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so, /usr/lib/powerpc64le-linux-gnu/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so, /usr/local/Cellar/softhsm/2.1.0/lib/softhsm/libsofthsm2.so"

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 31 Oct 2017 20:12:00 GMT):<br/>
@jgiron This is only needed if you are using a PKCS11 provider - see https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/config/config_pkcs11_test.yaml#L92 for the example that @biljana_lukovic mentioned.

<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 18:11:18 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda Regarding the vendor/thrid_party topic. Why do you copy fabric code in your repo and not use fabric as a dep? Currently it is not possible to include the fabric-sdk-go and fabric at the same time because of diplicate initialize issues of protobuf
Additionally there would be a lot of type problems because you "redefine" them (by copy&paste)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 18:25:00 GMT):<br/>
Fabric cannot be directly vendored in an SDK because it brings in too many dependencies
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 18:25:46 GMT):<br/>
The SDK is intended to be used at the same time of fabric - the proto inits were modified in a previous commit btw 
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 18:26:04 GMT):<br/>
(For that reason)

Hi @Kyroy, the duplicate protos issue is fixed by: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/commit/22e666e7dcc59ad690c6d2fb72a008bfb97dc35e
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 18:37:35 GMT):<br/>
Types returned by the SDK are distinct from fabric types and must be treated as such by applications.

<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Sat, 04 Nov 2017 11:46:35 GMT):<br/>
@Kyroy The core issue is current structure of the Fabric code, which doesn't have separation between the server code and the client API/libs. So if a client SDK wants to re-use zillions of lines of tested code from Fabric, straightforward vendoring brings in server packages that could conflict with the dependencies of the app using the SDK. See also https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-6317

When executing a transaction via ChannelClient.ExecuteTx(apitxn.ExecuteTxRequest{ChaincodeID: setup.ChainCodeID, Fcn: fcn, Args: args}), on 2 of my development machines it always succeeds even if I dramatically limit the memory of the docker container that contains the program. But if I run this on our hosting provider, only 10% of the transactions go through, while the other 90% fail with the following error:

@ranjan008 Looks like you have already installed a chaincode called 'ledger' on some channel, and you are trying again. The error is telling you that the chaincode has been already installed (on that channel).
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 12:40:14 GMT):<br/>
Org2 shares the channel with Org1 (I assume), no need to do it again for Org2 on the same channel

<p><strong>ranjan008</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 12:43:34 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 12:48:44 GMT):<br/>
Sorry, I should have said 'instantiate' instead of 'install'. See http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release/install_instantiate.html - you need to install to each peer but instantiate only once on any peer
</p>
<p><strong>ranjan008</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 12:52:01 GMT):<br/>
I initialized the chaincode for a peer in organization 1 and got the chaincode container up but I am not able to get the data when I am initializing my application for another peer in another organization.
</p>
<p><strong>ranjan008</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 12:53:05 GMT):<br/>
and also the chaincode container is running in only single peer not others.
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 12:55:00 GMT):<br/>
Instantiation goes against the ledger, and you do it only once on some peer that is on the channel you are targeting. To have it working on another peer (on the same channel), just install the chaincode on the second peer and you'll be able to invoke it
</p>
<p><strong>ranjan008</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 12:55:58 GMT):<br/>
I will try again and will check

@Mrsteven Thanks for looking into it. I aborted the steps which I was following and made a fresh start with steps provided at location http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release/build_network.html . Upto this page I was able to successfully load/configure most of the details on my Windows machine. Now when I tried to setup/test the sample network as mentioned in the link. I get following error

Hey Keshav, look like your folder structure is missing some folders. Can you check if the `crypto-config\peerOrganizations\org1.example.com\peers\peer0.org1.example.com\

<p><strong>BrechtDerwael</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 12:16:18 GMT):<br/>
Hey guys, I'm trying to build my go chaincode, but the pluginfactory.go keeps giving me this error:
```
$ go test
# github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bccsp/factory
/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bccsp/factory/pluginfactory.go:56: undefined: plugin in plugin.Open
/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bccsp/factory/pluginfactory.go:73: not enough arguments to return
```

Go versions 1.7.5 and 1.8 generate this error and I downloaded the SDK some weeks ago. Anyone got any pointers?
Thank you in advance!
</p>
<p><strong>BrechtDerwael</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 12:17:33 GMT):<br/>
Oh the code causing the error is:
```
// attempt to load the library as a plugin
plug, err := plugin.Open(config.PluginOpts.Library)
```
and
```
return new(config.PluginOpts.Config)
```
</p>
<p><strong>BrechtDerwael</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 12:30:31 GMT):<br/>
1.8.5 won't cut it either
</p>
<p><strong>BrechtDerwael</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 12:39:08 GMT):<br/>
Solved by upgrading to 1.8.5 which ad more descriptive error messages and setting my $GOROOT to the new directory, thanks for being my rubber duck :)

Any suggestions what could be the issue ?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 17 Nov 2017 02:29:26 GMT):<br/>
Hi all, is it known which git commit was intended to work against fabric and fabric-ca v1.0.3?  There are no tags in the repo past the alpha tags :-/
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 17 Nov 2017 03:38:33 GMT):<br/>
Also, will there ever be SDK docs?  There's no explicit explanation of which APIs are public/meant to be used by app developers.
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 17 Nov 2017 03:39:25 GMT):<br/>
Reading the unit test source code and figuring it out works, but it's making everyone do that work redundantly
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Fri, 17 Nov 2017 03:44:00 GMT):<br/>
In particular, I'd like to understand the high-level relationships between all the publicly-visible interfaces and structs.
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 17 Nov 2017 15:37:00 GMT):<br/>
@vdods The latest *should* work with 1.0.3, but we test against 1.0.4 so we cannot say for sure. Commit 5c79a681e479b69105b88c67313f180f7ee9a2ef was the last before we moved CI to 1.0.4, so that one works for sure.
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 17 Nov 2017 15:46:12 GMT):<br/>
As fort the Client API, all interfaces are under the api directory, and factories that create default implementations of the interfaces are under def/fabapi. SDK allows supplying custom implementation of many interfaces defined under api.
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 17 Nov 2017 15:50:05 GMT):<br/>
Agree, we need better docs. Still, the definitive reference to the relationships among interfaces and structs is the code under /api and /def/fabapi.
</p>

Why do you make the `channel.channelConfig` method private? You need this to get the configuration of the `testchainid` channel from the orderer. Or is there another way?

<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 23:15:17 GMT):<br/>
Perhaps increasing the test coverage would be the easiest way to get familiar with the internals of the SDK. It looks like we don't have a JIRA ticket for this task. I'll create one, and split it into many sub-tasks (by packages?) so anyone interested can pick them up. We need to increase the coverage to over 85%.
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 22:36:41 GMT):<br/>
@arjanvaneersel I created a bunch of subtasks under https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-4694, which is a blanket ticket for test coverage. I created one subtask for every package that has coverage below 85% (the Fabric standard). You can take a look and pick some package you are comfortable with. This ticket is very important, as we cannot declare 1.0 without bringing the coverage above 85%.
</p>
<p><strong>arjanvaneersel</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 06:50:14 GMT):<br/>
@aleksandar.likic I can definitely help out with writing tests. I'll take a look at it.

<p><strong>ysim</strong> (Fri, 01 Dec 2017 17:10:40 GMT):<br/>
Oops, sorry, could have been clearer. We're building out an API that makes use of fabric-sdk-go. Right now we're keeping track of the various fabric clients (resource management client, channel management client) in our own manager. Since a separate instance of the ChannelClient has to be created for each channel, do you suggest that we keep track of the various ChannelClient instantiations or to re-instantiate every time?

@ysim We intended the new SDK clients to be relatively cheap to create (so that you could have a different client for each channel / config / opt that was needed). We also have placeholder contexts to be useable to share some more expensive data (eg. dynamic discovery information) - contexts are still TBD/TODO though.  That said, not sure that we considered recreating every time ourselves. ( @bstasyszyn / @aleksandar.likic - thoughts?)

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 18:17:31 GMT):<br/>
The current style is that peer shouldn't be in the signature of functions
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 18:17:56 GMT):<br/>
rather the peer list should be determined from config/discovery
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 18:18:19 GMT):<br/>
and a WithOpts fn should be provided that allows override of the target peer
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 18:18:46 GMT):<br/>
(of course, this isn't due to your change but a previous change that should be enhanced to match the style)
</p>
<p><strong>nchangfong</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 18:39:47 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda sounds good. should I update the PR by limiting the changes to the package name and create a different one to make the function private?

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 06 Dec 2017 18:40:22 GMT):<br/>

What's the process for vendoring packages to import in chaincode? I did govendor add [package name] but when i do govendor list its listed as unused and im still getting build errors when i try to instantiate

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 07 Dec 2017 17:10:29 GMT):<br/>
@habpygo the tests are currently running against stable by default. I am rerunning tests of sdk head against 1.1-preview here: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/15095 (just kicked it off)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 07 Dec 2017 17:11:42 GMT):<br/>
@habpygo are you using def/fabapi or the lower level packages directly?
</p>
<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Thu, 07 Dec 2017 17:29:48 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda I'm using `deffab "github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/def/fabapi"` ,i.e. via de Go sdk and not fabric sdk. 
I was running the test with the 1.1-preview and didn't have any problems.

<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Thu, 07 Dec 2017 17:31:06 GMT):<br/>
Often it's a `path` issue, but this time I don't know.

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 07 Dec 2017 17:31:45 GMT):<br/>

@Antonio_M The error is not about ecert, it's about tls cert. It seems that the CA tls cert doesn't match the CA host name.
</p>
<p><strong>Antonio_M</strong> (Sun, 10 Dec 2017 17:45:22 GMT):<br/>
@aleksandar.likic you are right, I fixed the name and now I'm getting signed by unknown authority issues. 
So I should have signed all the CA certs with a common root cert? If so, where do I specify the location of the root cert?

Indeed SDK-Go runs with HLF-v1.1.0-preview. :thumbsup:

For CouchDB users, note that they have removed/forgotten(?) the tag `latest`. So you may have to set this to the preview tag like `x86_64-1.1.0-preview` as in my case. You can check for the existing tags here https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/fabric-couchdb/tags/

@yacovm  I have  a query regarding signconfigtx .   Do we have node APIs for the same and update the config . I searched was not able to find that .  IF we have to write node APIs could you please let me know which GRPC interfaces to be used . I have  a use case to create an app to reconfigure the network .

<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 04:46:52 GMT):<br/>
I feel that being able to load the config from bytes and having support for embedded pem files rather than paths is great, but it would be even more useful if those could be passed in as a golang structure to the sdk. This way people (such as myself) could have their own config file format that they use for the rest of their application, which then embeds the sdk config. Right now in order to achieve this, I would have to either write my own provider factory with a custom config provider, or read my own config, then serialize the fabric sdk relevant parts to a byte array and then pass it on to the sdk.

@troyronda @aleksandar.likic @Baha-sk we're considering writing a PR for having more files embedded in a config struct as @e-nikolov outlines above, but before we jump into this we'd like to discuss it with you to make sure it can be merged with fabric-sdk-go over time as successfully as possible. 
</p>
<p><strong>jellevdp</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 11:15:43 GMT):<br/>
so basically, the common connection profile as golang struct with files embedded. How can we best approach this in such a way that the chance of it being merged in with the fabric-sdk-go as high as possible? (considering impact on API etc)

@e-nikolov @jellevdp yes we recently added config bytes capability as you noticed (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/def/fabapi/fabapi.go#L32), but haven't put much thought into a golang struct version. It seems like a reasonable idea. @Baha-sk @aleksandar.likic  any thoughts?

<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 19:34:35 GMT):<br/>
currently we're following Fabric's config setup which is loading the configs from a file and as Troy said, we added the loading configs from a byte array well.. wrapping the config maintenance around an API is a good idea, but not sure if it's worth the effort.. usually the fabric client loads the config once, any change requires a client restart, just like the peers
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 19:39:16 GMT):<br/>
@e-nikolov as for embedding the pems in the config, it was added to support configs without having to access files from the mapped volumes (ie: no access file access rights).. if there's a need to embed other files, it can be done the same way
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 20:11:07 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk the cryptoconfig path still needs a volume to be mapped
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 20:20:09 GMT):<br/>
which is what we are trying to find a way around
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 20:20:23 GMT):<br/>
I'll have a deeper look to see how this can be changed
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 20:23:32 GMT):<br/>
It seems that there is one config inside the client section, which sets the path to the cryptoconfig and then each organization has its own cryptoPath config which is relative to the cryptoconfig path
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 20:48:55 GMT):<br/>
cryptoConfig isn't a mapped volume in the configs, it's a local path to the cryptoConfig generated folder by the cryptogen tool
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 20:50:00 GMT):<br/>
if you look at the path in the sample config.yaml, it is as follows: 
path: $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/test/fixtures/channel/crypto-config
assuming the one using the sdk go has the dev environment properly setup
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 20:50:15 GMT):<br/>
this can be changed to any local path for the client
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 20:51:03 GMT):<br/>
as long as they have the proper certs structure under their crypto-config folder
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 21:44:35 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk I don't think I understand the difference in the need for embedding the pems into the config and embedding the cryptoconfig. To me it seems that they should both support the same mechanisms
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 21:53:21 GMT):<br/>
Maybe you have a different use case to us. In our case, we are building a sort of a blockchain connectivity application, which should be able to connect to any hyperledger fabric based on a provided config. And it would make our lives much easier if we could upload a single config file that contains all the necessary information (e.g. pems and cryptoconfig), rather than having to supply multiple files and then having to match the paths in the config file to the path where we save the referred files.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 21:53:31 GMT):<br/>
@aleksandar.likic - @e-nikolov raises a good point about cryptoconfig 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 13 Dec 2017 22:33:30 GMT):<br/>
probably makes sense..

Hey guys, I've got a question about how the SDK handles the different kinds of events to listen for.  The protos define 4 types -- Register (notification of registration of interest in event), Block (notification that a block has been committed), Chaincode (presumably for when a transaction is committed in which stub.SetEvent is called), and Rejection (presumably when a transaction is rejected -- but in what context?).  I'm writing my own event-listening code (not using fabric-sdk-go), and even though I'm registering my interest in getting Chaincode and Rejection events, I'm not seeing any.  I am seeing Block events.  Is there some fact I'm missing?
</p>
<p><strong>vdods</strong> (Mon, 18 Dec 2017 20:18:58 GMT):<br/>
I've heard that Fabric 1.1 will only have Block events and no others -- is this maybe already true of Fabric 1.0.3 (or 1.0.x)?

@ranjan008 the ordering service creates blocks from transactions. Blocks are created based on receiving sufficient transactions for a block or timeout. I think ~2 seconds was the default on the ordering service so your number isn't too surprising.

@ranjan008 Fabric creates blocks from transactions. Blocks are created based on receiving sufficient transactions for a block or timeout. I think ~2 seconds was the default timeout so your number isn't too surprising.

Hi @troyronda does fabric-sdk-go supports chaincode upgrade? where is the API, thanks
</p>
<p><strong>Chalex</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 10:01:56 GMT):<br/>
I used fabric-sdk-go in my golang code. But then I compiled my go gode, it reported multiple definition of many functions.
</p>
<p><strong>Chalex</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 10:02:24 GMT):<br/>
Does anyone have any idea about this error?

<p><strong>Chalex</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 11:37:30 GMT):<br/>
I found the reason. It's because i imported fabric-sdk-go and fabric source together like bellow:

and then if i compile with `go build`
</p>
<p><strong>Chalex</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 11:38:09 GMT):<br/>
it will report errors like above

<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Sun, 24 Dec 2017 10:47:30 GMT):<br/>
Why is it necessary to use the substPathVars function on many paths coming from the config? Doesn't whatever go function is used for loading the file from the path already support dealing with environment variables?
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Sun, 24 Dec 2017 10:52:21 GMT):<br/>
I think os.ExpandEnv does this
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sun, 24 Dec 2017 13:01:08 GMT):<br/>
@e-nikolov probably should have been os.Expand with a custom mapping function
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sun, 24 Dec 2017 13:01:56 GMT):<br/>
re: ExpandEnv: GOPATH is no longer required to be an environment variable so need to use the GoPath from the build package
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sun, 24 Dec 2017 13:03:05 GMT):<br/>
Also it is desired to have defaults when env isn't set for test cases (so go test can work without ENV variable being required)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sun, 24 Dec 2017 13:03:38 GMT):<br/>
probably would make sense to have os.Expand custom mapping function try the environment first and then fall back to defaults for the above
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 15:18:31 GMT):<br/>
fabric-sdk-go has its own vendor dependencies
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 15:18:39 GMT):<br/>
so you need to make sure those dependencies are also in your vendor
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 15:18:52 GMT):<br/>
then you call fabapi, yes
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 15:19:26 GMT):<br/>
soon we will split fabapi into two packages and I'll post an update about that

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 15:19:42 GMT):<br/>
with the hope that it will be less confusing and more flexible

:sweat_smile: OK, then how  to install that? Can I simply do `go get fabric-sdk-go`?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 15:21:17 GMT):<br/>
if you use dep then you can just use dep to setup your vendoring - the SDK supports dep the best
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 15:21:30 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/golang/dep
</p>
<p><strong>xuchenhao001</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 15:22:10 GMT):<br/>
ok! I just finished `go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep`, what should I do then? 
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 15:22:17 GMT):<br/>
(SDK includes the constraint definitions for dep)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 15:22:32 GMT):<br/>
in your application, run dep init
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 15:22:58 GMT):<br/>
it should generate you a .toml and .lock file
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 15:23:04 GMT):<br/>
and populate your vendor directory
</p>
<p><strong>xuchenhao001</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 15:23:58 GMT):<br/>
ok I'll try!
</p>
<p><strong>xuchenhao001</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 15:24:34 GMT):<br/>
before `dep init` should I put `fabric-sdk-go` into `vendor` dir?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 18:23:45 GMT):<br/>
@xuchenhao001 the dep tool analyzes your code to figure out what should be in vendor
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 18:24:07 GMT):<br/>
so no need to manually put sdk in vendor if you are using dep
</p>
<p><strong>xuchenhao001</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 01:21:46 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda yes, but I just want to install `fabric-sdk-go` package first, and then write down my code based on that. Any idea about that?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 01:23:32 GMT):<br/>
sure .. you can run dep init
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 01:25:06 GMT):<br/>
and then dep ensure -add github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go
</p>
<p><strong>xuchenhao001</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 01:26:03 GMT):<br/>
ok! I'll try it. thanks again!
</p>
<p><strong>xuchenhao001</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 01:28:24 GMT):<br/>
```
dep ensure -add github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go
no dirs contained any Go code
```
</p>
<p><strong>xuchenhao001</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 01:28:59 GMT):<br/>
:worried: I run this in an empty dir
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 01:29:02 GMT):<br/>
you need at least one go file in your dir :)
</p>
<p><strong>xuchenhao001</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 01:29:09 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>xuchenhao001</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 01:31:24 GMT):<br/>
```# dep ensure -add github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go
Fetching sources...

"github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go" is not imported by your project, and has been temporarily added to Gopkg.lock and vendor/.
If you run "dep ensure" again before actually importing it, it will disappear from Gopkg.lock and vendor/.
```
</p>
<p><strong>xuchenhao001</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 01:31:55 GMT):<br/>
I checked my vendor dir and the `fabric-sdk-go` is in there!
</p>
<p><strong>xuchenhao001</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 01:33:01 GMT):<br/>
So I can write my code now? after that, can i simply build my project by `go build`?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 01:34:51 GMT):<br/>
once you have some real code, you should run dep ensure to pull down depenencies
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 01:34:56 GMT):<br/>
and then go build
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 01:35:15 GMT):<br/>
real code meaning code that imports SDK
</p>
<p><strong>xuchenhao001</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 01:35:37 GMT):<br/>
I mean, I don't need to build any dependencies of `fabric-sdk-go`?
</p>
<p><strong>xuchenhao001</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 01:35:46 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I got it.
</p>
<p><strong>xuchenhao001</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 12:30:58 GMT):<br/>
:sob: Any one can help me? I got an error when I run `dep init -v`: ```No versions of golang.org/x/exp met constraints:

In https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/fabric-client/orderer/orderer.go#L34

Does the orderer.NewOrderer(url string, certificate string, serverHostOverride string, config apiconfig.Config) work with the new embedded Pems or does it only work with paths?

Judging by the NewOrdererFromConfig below it, ordererCfg.TLSCACerts.Path is passed into the `certificate` parameter.

Does the orderer.NewOrderer(url string, certificate string, serverHostOverride string, config apiconfig.Config) work with the new embedded Pems or does it only work with paths?

I see that in the NewOrdererFromConfig() below it, ordererCfg.TLSCACerts.Path is passed into the `certificate` parameter.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 21:52:06 GMT):<br/>
@e-nikolov anything that accesses TLSClientCerts should be able to access certs through embedded Pem or through paths
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 21:53:05 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk How do I call orderer.NewOrderer with an embedded cert?
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 21:54:14 GMT):<br/>
If I pass the pem of the certificate to NewOrderer, it tries to open a file with that name and fails instead of using the pem directly
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 21:55:11 GMT):<br/>
under Orderer in the config.yaml.. there should be a tlsCACerts group with path value
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 21:55:26 GMT):<br/>
you can replace it with pem: | ....
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 21:55:30 GMT):<br/>
i know
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 21:55:31 GMT):<br/>
i did that
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 21:55:50 GMT):<br/>
ok, and?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 21:56:09 GMT):<br/>
did it work?
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 21:56:09 GMT):<br/>
doesn't work
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 21:56:29 GMT):<br/>
what error do you get?
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 21:56:29 GMT):<br/>
because NewOrderer seems to expect a path
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 21:57:09 GMT):<br/>
When I look at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/fabric-client/orderer/orderer.go#L34
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 21:57:33 GMT):<br/>
I really think it doesn't support pems
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 21:57:52 GMT):<br/>
maybe I'm not supposed to use that function directly?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 21:57:56 GMT):<br/>
TLSCACertPool doesn't support pems yet
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:00:22 GMT):<br/>
currently NewOrderer's signature expects a path as an argument
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:00:35 GMT):<br/>
yes, that was my feeling as well
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:00:48 GMT):<br/>
func NewOrderer(url string, *certificate string*, serverHostOverride string, config apiconfig.Config) (*Orderer, error)
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:02:28 GMT):<br/>
also, it is preferable to use NewOrdererFromConfig function to take advantage of overriding the ssl hostname (useful in dev mode)
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:02:54 GMT):<br/>
that's where I saw that the path was being sent directly
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:03:13 GMT):<br/>
but if you like to add support for an embedded []byte argument, you can create a second function
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:03:48 GMT):<br/>
currently, the sdk doesn't support NewOrderer with []byte argument
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:04:11 GMT):<br/>
NewOrdererFromBytes?
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:05:02 GMT):<br/>
NewOrdererWithByteCertificate?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:05:03 GMT):<br/>
add Cert maybe.. NewOrdrererFromBytesCert
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:05:15 GMT):<br/>
yeah, that's more like it
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:06:07 GMT):<br/>
but if you want to support serverhost override, then you need to duplicate NewOrdererFromConfig as well
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:07:24 GMT):<br/>
it's optional.. 
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:07:39 GMT):<br/>
what if we first tried to use the certificate parameter as a file path and if that failed, try using it as a pem?
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:07:48 GMT):<br/>
sounds a bit dirty though
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:08:04 GMT):<br/>
usually pem should take precedence over path
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:08:18 GMT):<br/>
try pem first, then if it doesn't exist, then use path
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:09:26 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, actually NewOrdererFromConfig already has access to both the path and the pem
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:10:10 GMT):<br/>
so it can do the checking and then invoke the appropriate method for bytes or path
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:10:28 GMT):<br/>
we don't need 2 new methods
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:10:29 GMT):<br/>
just one
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:10:30 GMT):<br/>
ordererCfg.TLSCACerts.Path is hardcoded in NewOrdererFromConfig... then yeah... you can refactor this code to check for Pem first
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:10:37 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:10:47 GMT):<br/>
so we're in agreement
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:11:44 GMT):<br/>
Do I need to create a new jira issue for this, or do I link the commit to something existing?
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:11:50 GMT):<br/>
not sure what the protocol is
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:12:23 GMT):<br/>
but you'll have to change pkg/config/comm/comm.go, the function TLSConfig(...) must also support []byte argument as well
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:13:06 GMT):<br/>
yes, you can create a lira issue for fabric-sdk-go component
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:13:06 GMT):<br/>

No problem, I need those things myself, that's why I work on them :)
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:18:40 GMT):<br/>
By the way in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/config/comm/comm.go#L20, the error that is returned is ignored
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:18:43 GMT):<br/>
is that intentional?
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:18:43 GMT):<br/>
do you know if that is intentional?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:25:36 GMT):<br/>
it's ignored as the condition right after will check the cert.. and if it's missing or empty, then it returns an error right away
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 22:26:46 GMT):<br/>
personally I would check for the error, not sure why it's not checked

Would it be acceptable to change the 
  TLSCACertPool(tlsCertificate string) (*x509.CertPool, error) into 
  TLSCACertPool(certConfig TLSConfig) (*x509.CertPool, error)

in order for it to support both Path and Pem, or would it be preferable to leave it as it is and add a separate method to the interface (e.g. TLSCACertPoolFromTLSConfig)?

</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 15:40:41 GMT):<br/>
NewTLSConfig()?
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 15:41:26 GMT):<br/>
TLSConfig2()?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:24:37 GMT):<br/>
actually there's a better way in refactoring this..
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:27:32 GMT):<br/>
instead of creating new functions we can pass in variadic configs or functional options as mentioned in this link: https://dave.cheney.net/2014/10/17/functional-options-for-friendly-apis
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:28:29 GMT):<br/>
I've read that article I'll see if I can implement it that way
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:28:52 GMT):<br/>
but that would still require a new method I think
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:29:14 GMT):<br/>
since the current one already requires the path as a string
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:29:32 GMT):<br/>
I think NewOrderer should not have the cert path as an argument.. it should be loaded from the config directly
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:30:34 GMT):<br/>
NewOrdererFromConfig is kind of doing the functional options thing but it's calling NewOrderer directly
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:30:38 GMT):<br/>
if we remove it, it breaks backwards compatibility though?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:31:18 GMT):<br/>
and I also noticed NewPeer as the cert path as argument.. which needs to change as well
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:31:29 GMT):<br/>
yeah, there are a bunch of those
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:31:57 GMT):<br/>
I think all of them should have a way of accepting a TLSConfig struct
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:32:08 GMT):<br/>
most probably it will break backward compatibility
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:32:47 GMT):<br/>
no just TLSConfig... the functions are already passing ing the config.. NewOrderer/NewPeer should load the certs from the config reference instead of passing them
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:33:28 GMT):<br/>
But the config contains the pems of all orderers
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:33:43 GMT):<br/>
while NewOrderer() needs to create a single orderer from 1 pem
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:33:53 GMT):<br/>
that's why the path to the pem is given directly
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:33:59 GMT):<br/>
I don't think it will work just from the config
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:35:13 GMT):<br/>
I've seen NewOrderer() be used in combination with config.RandomOrdererConfig()
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:35:14 GMT):<br/>
I think only the url is the mandatory field to identify the orderer.. NewOrderer should fetch the corresponding cert from the config directly
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:37:31 GMT):<br/>
I see, the config argument passed to NewOrderer is supposed to be the client config, not the orderer config
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:42:40 GMT):<br/>
what makes more sense is hide NewOrderer function then rename NewOrdererFromConfig into NewOrderer and add the path/pem logic in there
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:43:26 GMT):<br/>
what do you mean by hide?
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:46:01 GMT):<br/>
If you mean to replace it, then I agree that it makes the most sense code base wise, but we might break other people's code
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:46:12 GMT):<br/>
hide is making the function private (function with first letter being lowercase)
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:47:52 GMT):<br/>
that's the same as removing it from outside people's perspective
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:47:58 GMT):<br/>
but we should also make use of the variadic argument in the function signature..
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:47:59 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:48:28 GMT):<br/>
the list of orderers is already in the client config if I remember well
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:50:20 GMT):<br/>
the function should have only the url as first argument (mandatory field) and the variadic config (config ...Config) and inside the function there should be logic to retrieve the ordererConfig  from config (including orderer cert from pem/path)
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:53:40 GMT):<br/>
this will break backward compatibility, but it will be a more cleaner way of calling the function
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:53:48 GMT):<br/>
how do you obtain the orderer config if you don't supply the variadic config?
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:54:06 GMT):<br/>
isn't it always necessary to supply it?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:55:23 GMT):<br/>
OrdererConfig is embedded in the SDK's client config..
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:55:49 GMT):<br/>
What should be variadic then?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:55:50 GMT):<br/>
look at the sample sdk config.yaml in fabric-sdk-go/test/fixtures/config/config_test.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:56:36 GMT):<br/>
that's what I'm trying to figure out... according to the doc.. one can set the config on the fly when calling NewOrdrerer....
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:58:12 GMT):<br/>
orderer, err := NewOrdrerer(url, apiconfig.Config{
actual config entries here line by line
})
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 18:01:32 GMT):<br/>
then NewOrderer can access Config the way it is right now.. and to retrieve OrdererConfig, you can get it with config.OrdererConfig(name string)
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 18:09:30 GMT):<br/>
aren't the url and the name different things?
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 18:13:50 GMT):<br/>
I already have one implementation that doesn't break backwards compatibility and creates new methods for the new functionality.
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 18:14:19 GMT):<br/>
I'll submit a change request so you can have a look if you want
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 18:18:23 GMT):<br/>
we shouldn't be creating new methods
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 18:19:03 GMT):<br/>
too many functions to do the same thing is not recommended and will confuse users of the sdk
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 18:19:38 GMT):<br/>
we should have 1 main function for NewOrderer and NewPeer.. that does the whole logic
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 18:19:54 GMT):<br/>
I think these functions were not properly created initially
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 18:21:08 GMT):<br/>
we can either pass the orderer name (as per the config to make it follow the config names) or the url, but we need a way to map the url to the name in the config
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 18:22:19 GMT):<br/>
and the second argument should be the variadic config argument or optional function 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 18:24:14 GMT):<br/>
I'll bb after lunch..
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 18:24:24 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 18:24:42 GMT):<br/>
I am still not completely clear on what you envision the variadic configs to be
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 18:24:55 GMT):<br/>
apiconfig.Config is an interface
</p>

docker-compose up -d won't load the entire docker-compose file set
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 12 Jan 2018 14:57:35 GMT):<br/>
you can use (for example):
make dockerenv-stable-up
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 12 Jan 2018 14:57:55 GMT):<br/>
(in the Fabric SDK Go directory)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 12 Jan 2018 14:58:23 GMT):<br/>
and you can substitute "stable" for another target (prev, prerelease)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 12 Jan 2018 14:58:49 GMT):<br/>
We should probably allow passing a -d option there...

and 
in another terminal I did
1.cd /Users/pt/MY_universe/WS/go_ws/GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/test/integration/e2e

--force-recreate is just to keep a clean slate for the SDK's tests

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=BhjfT3oYcLZ9PbGYZ) @troyronda if I am not wrong docker-compose up --force-recreate -d
shouldn't lose data if the volume is external like
volumes:
path:host path


my yaml has the following in docker-compose.yaml
peer0.org1.example.com:
volumes:
/var/run/:/host/var/run/

<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Sat, 13 Jan 2018 14:44:18 GMT):<br/>
In https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/fabric-client/peer/peerendorser.go#L38

Is there a good reason why newPeerEndorser() returns a struct rather than pointer to struct?
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Sat, 13 Jan 2018 14:47:11 GMT):<br/>
Because of this there are things like

return peerEndorser{}, errors.New("target is required")
instead of 
return nil, errors.New("target is required")
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Sat, 13 Jan 2018 14:48:55 GMT):<br/>
and it gets converted to pointer anyway in all callers of newPeerEndorser()
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 13 Jan 2018 16:43:11 GMT):<br/>
@e-nikolov not really
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 13 Jan 2018 16:43:29 GMT):<br/>
Probably at the time it was just a small amount of data
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Sat, 13 Jan 2018 16:43:45 GMT):<br/>
it makes me write one extra line of code and I hate that :D
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 13 Jan 2018 16:43:47 GMT):<br/>
But it’s awkward if it’s converted to a pointer later anyways
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 13 Jan 2018 16:44:11 GMT):<br/>
So might as well be a pointer returned
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Sat, 13 Jan 2018 16:44:19 GMT):<br/>
I changed it in my refactor around the NewPeer()
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 13 Jan 2018 16:44:53 GMT):<br/>
Btw - I wonder if func signatures are changing anyways, perhaps those constructors should simply be named New
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 13 Jan 2018 16:45:17 GMT):<br/>
peer.NewPeer is a bit repetitive:)
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Sat, 13 Jan 2018 16:45:21 GMT):<br/>
true
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Sat, 13 Jan 2018 16:45:39 GMT):<br/>

Could you give me an example about how to list channels or communicate with fabric network with `fabric-sdk-go`? Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>xuchenhao001</strong> (Sun, 14 Jan 2018 13:37:07 GMT):<br/>
I have read about the example of https://github.com/chainHero/heroes-service, but it's `fabric-sdk-go` is too old for now
</p>
<p><strong>xuchenhao001</strong> (Sun, 14 Jan 2018 13:39:09 GMT):<br/>
Just several lines about how to use `client`, `peer` or `sdk` is ok, thank you!

<p><strong>xuchenhao001</strong> (Sun, 14 Jan 2018 13:46:52 GMT):<br/>

Ok. is there any article or sample explaining how to get explicit approval from a remote peer manually by clicking a UI button or something before adding the transaction to chain ? I want to write an Android/iOS client app which will push notification to admin who will approve a transaction to be added on chain by clicking some button. isn't it is the main purpose of grpc ?

Hey @ga25waq  not sure if I follow you correctly, but have a look at https://github.com/securekey/fabric-examples/tree/master/fabric-cli where you will find many Query commands that you run from the CLI. Perhaps you could also use `$ go run fabric-cli.go event listenblock --format json` that listens for events and spits out the results if something happens.

Hi everyone, I am trying to connect the e2e.go example from the fabric-sdk-go repository to my own HF-netowork but there are some certs that i can not figure out how the have been generated. 
```

we have an item in the SDK backlog to have an SDK API that enrolls users/identities and produce PEMs. right now that SDK functionality is very old - stores enrolled users into a JSON file-based state store.

Can some one answer a question
Chaincode allows for rich queries if I use a storage option of CouchDB.
What if some of my peers have couchdb and other use a world-state default for their own peer (non CouchDB).
Obviously the rich queries are bound to fail or give inconsistent result.

So how can we ensure that all give conisistent results?

<p><strong>ga25waq</strong> (Sat, 27 Jan 2018 13:03:25 GMT):<br/>
Hi, I've got a question regarding the channel management client: I've written a bootstrapper that creates a channel (by sending a SaveChannelRequest to the orderer), joins peers to that channel, installs & instantiates chaincode etc. I want to make my bootstrapper idempotent, i.e. when it is executed on a network that has already been bootstrapped, the bootstrapper should not fail und just do nothing. I've managed to make the join channel / installl & instantiate chaincode parts idempotent, but I haven't found a way to make the channel creation via the orderer idempotent. When I send the same SaveChannelRequest (with the same channel configuration transaction) to the orderer, the SDK just return an generic error (without specifying the error's cause exactly). In the orderer logs, there is an entry that says that the request failed as the channel already exists. But I don't get that information via the SDK. How can I find out before sending the SaveChannelRequest that the channel has already been created? Is the only possibility to query a peer for a list of channels it has joined?
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Sat, 27 Jan 2018 15:25:27 GMT):<br/>
Hi @ga25waq, we ran into the same issue in our tests. Unfortunately, the orderer returns a generic 'BAD_REQUEST' status code for duplicate SaveChannel requests. As you've observed, we work around this by grouping SaveChannel and JoinChannel operations together and query the peer's joined channels to achieve idempotence.
</p>
<p><strong>ga25waq</strong> (Sat, 27 Jan 2018 15:32:26 GMT):<br/>
Hi @divyank, thanks for your quick reply! OK, then I guess we'll have to live with that workaround for a while. Hopefully, the Fabric developers return a more specific error soon.

Hi all,

Maybe a weird problem but has anyone had the problem before that the CA server says it can't register a new identity because it has already been registered? Obviously the problem is that ... it is already registered. However the very strange thing is that I can't for the life of me find where my CA server could be keeping these settings because I refresh/delete all before restarting my project.  Delete all docker images, containers, remove the /tmp/enroll_user folder, /tmp/msp etc   And still, even after doing all those things when restarting everthing, which should be a complete reset of everything, when I start all and try to register an identity through the SDK I get the following:

It really feels as if I am missing something so very obvious but as far as I know deleting /tmp/msg /tmp/enroll_user, the actual CA container and in worst case the docker image should be more enough for a clean restart.  Unless my setup is somehow magically using a fabric-ca-server.db that is on my host but that would be strange.

Could it be docker that is caching something?

Hi all,

Maybe a weird problem but has anyone had the problem before that the CA server says it can't register a new identity because it has already been registered? Obviously the problem is that ... it is already registered. However the very strange thing is that I can't for the life of me find where my CA server could be keeping these settings because I refresh/delete all before restarting my project.  Delete all docker images, containers, remove the /tmp/enroll_user folder, /tmp/msp etc   And still, even after doing all those things when restarting everthing, which should be a complete reset of everything, when I start all and try to register an identity through the SDK I get the following:



```

@iamdm gopackager creates an in-memory package from a CC source code, required for creating InstallChaincodeRequest, for installing the CC. See InstallCC() in test/integration/base_test_setup.go. Only GOLANG CCs are currently supported.
</p>
<p><strong>iamdm</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 10:12:09 GMT):<br/>
@aleksandar.likic can i distribute ccpackage output to another peers for installing chaincode on them?
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 10:13:58 GMT):<br/>
This is what the SDK does when Client.InstallChaincode(..) is called.
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 10:16:42 GMT):<br/>
... passing the package to the peer in a grpc call, not as a file, if that's your question.
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 10:19:21 GMT):<br/>
You can check https://github.com/securekey/fabric-examples/tree/master/fabric-cli, it supports chaincode install/deploy.

Hi all,
I am wondering if the data sent from the client to the peers are encrypted?
I see that in the config file we need to use a user's private key but I think my peers don't have the associated public key... Does the client send it too?
How does it work?

A recent commit changed the default file extension of the filekeyvaluestore. It affects clients who use client.SaveUserToStateStore() and client.LoadUserFromStateStore() to save/load user JSON files, as the default file extension is not .json any more. If you are affected, please take a look at https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17625/ to see how to modify client code to have .json file extension with the new key store implementation and keep compatibility with previously created stores.

<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 16:32:43 GMT):<br/>
OK, I think I see the problem.
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 16:52:01 GMT):<br/>
When a new non-ephemeral key is generated by the sdk, it is stored automatically by the underlying crypto provider in its key store (defined by client.credentialStore.cryptoStore.path in configuration). On the client side, upon enrollment, you need to store the SKI (publicKey.SKI()), which later you can use to lookup the private key from the crypto provider using GetKey(ski). 
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 16:54:39 GMT):<br/>
Now, here is the problem: I've been working on refactoring how the sdk storage works (in support for enrollment), and it seems I introduced a bug with commit e50cd2550d267b125eee6c584f048713b1357618. Whether you are affected by this or not, it depends what api you are using. The high level API (loading identities using .WithUser(username)) is affected. I'll create a JIRA bug and fix this asap.

<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 20:30:22 GMT):<br/>
@baoyangc Looks like I was wrong, newly generated keys are currently NOT stored anywhere on the client side. They are stored on the server (Fabric CA) side, but the client has to looks after them itself on the client side. This means storing the enrolled users' certs and private keys (SW crypto provider only). So nothing is actually broken, there won't be any fix at the moment. However, we are working on a high-level API for enrollment, it will be ready in a week or so. We are planning to have some key/cert management included in the sdk so the app doesn't have do it. Stay tuned!

@aleksandar.likic @e-nikolov that message sounds like: either the cert weren't loaded properly (or wasn't sent properly to the peer). I'd think the former is more likely as tests are passing though.

Hey guys, Maybe this one is off topic. I'm trying to implement the Fabric Go SDK but I'm stuck at a point. I wanted to get block info, Like block height, Hash and all. Is there any way to get that info?

Hi! I've created a new instance of ChannelClient and now I want to subscribe to a chaincode event via the ChannelClient's RegisterChaincodeEvent method. Unfortunately, it seems that the underlying event hub never gets connected (dumping the ChannelClient shows a 'connected: (bool) false' for its event hub). Do I have to connect the event hub manually? How can I do that for a ChannelClient? I had a look at base_test_setup.go where a new event hub is created and connected manually. But that way, I cannot use the ChannelClient's convenience method RegisterChaincodeEvent that writes the events to a channel.

@baoyangc See https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17775/ and https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-8212 . I added https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/17775/5/pkg/fabric-client/credentialmgr/enrollment_test.go to ensure that GetSigningIdentity() works correctly on enrollment. Application still needs to manage the enrollment cert (to save it upon enrollment), we will have the SDK doing this soon.

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 10:25:50 GMT):<br/>
@e-nikolov some interfaces like chclient figure out the peers from config and discovery. Others will simply have a targets slice on the methods. See ChannelLedger for example.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 10:26:37 GMT):<br/>
At the end, there will not be a need to mutate the object via adders/getters.

</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 10:33:05 GMT):<br/>
Yes, but I would probably mark it as deprecated in the godoc once it's fully deprecated, and put a note or something before that

</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 16:12:36 GMT):<br/>
it doesn't seem to be used in anything other than setupEventHub(t *testing.T, client *fabsdk.FabricSDK, identity fab.IdentityContext) error, which in turn doesn't use it for anything
</p>
<p><strong>ga25waq</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 18:18:44 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda Thanks for the fix! I did not have a look at every single line of code regarding the event management, but an EventHub is linked to a single peer. That is why the question arised if the SDK considers the validity of a transaction that leads to a chaincode event. In other words: If I require peers of two different organizations to endorse a transaction on a chaincode, is it guaranteed that the chaincode event (and its payload) received via a ChannelClient belongs to a validated and committed transaction (that fulfills the endorsement policy etc.)? Or can the peer(s) serving as an event hub manipulate the event at will (in that case the client would have to perform a separate query that gets validated after having received the event)?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 18:19:56 GMT):<br/>
we usually use a separate query for events where they client needs to know the validation status.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 18:20:07 GMT):<br/>
particularly with Fabric 1.1's filtered events
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 18:20:27 GMT):<br/>
(which are are currently implementing into the Go SDK)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 18:22:01 GMT):<br/>
@e-nikolov yes (I was also removing unnecessary receivers when I saw them)
</p>
<p><strong>ga25waq</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 18:23:22 GMT):<br/>
So the client would have to revalidate the information of the event and its payload, e.g. by performing a separate query?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 18:24:16 GMT):<br/>
that's one mechanism to to do, yes

I guess you are also thinking about receiving events from multiple peers as another idea
</p>
<p><strong>ga25waq</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 18:26:37 GMT):<br/>
Yes, but then I would have to coordinate the various event hubs and compare the (possibly varying) results on my own, right?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 18:28:47 GMT):<br/>
yes - the SDK doesn't have this mechanism at the moment.

<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 13:11:23 GMT):<br/>
The warning came from golang's protobufs, which seemed pretty strange
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 13:11:47 GMT):<br/>
from the access of a map that was surrounded by mutexes

Hello, is there any example code of how to register user and save to storage. I try to modify fabric-sdk-go/test/integration/fab/fabric_ca_test.go and successfully registered, enrolled, and saved a new user. But from what I understand, github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pkg/fabric-client is already deplecated and shouldn't be used anymore. So I try to explore github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pkg/fabsdk, but found only method to read user from an existing state but not how to save a new one. Where should I look for next?

@e-nikolov on Go 1.10, i'm getting the same error as is reported here: https://github.com/google/certificate-transparency-go/issues/153
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 17 Feb 2018 20:26:24 GMT):<br/>
interestingly go tool fix -r cftype vendor/github.com/google/certificate-transparency-go/x509/root_cgo_darwin.go fixes it
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 17 Feb 2018 20:41:12 GMT):<br/>
@e-nikolov to use Go 1.10, you need these changes: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/18015/
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 17 Feb 2018 20:41:40 GMT):<br/>

Hi guys! I have question on dev process of subj which affects project I run. What's release policy of fabric-sdk-go ? As I see, almost every commit in master affects backward compatibility with my private code. Also, there are only two tags (v1.0.0-alpha & v1.0.0-alpha2) in git. Both of them are quite outdated. 
</p>
<p><strong>olegvg</strong> (Sun, 18 Feb 2018 16:38:10 GMT):<br/>
So... which branch should I use in time between tags?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sun, 18 Feb 2018 17:10:47 GMT):<br/>
@olegvg aiming for next tag end of month - we are in the midst of a refactor preparing for the tag
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sun, 18 Feb 2018 17:11:53 GMT):<br/>
And also updating to 1.1 features - particularly delivery service
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sun, 18 Feb 2018 17:12:48 GMT):<br/>
It is also important for our projects to get to a stabilized API soon - hence the rapid work over the last month

Hi, @troyronda, in fabric-sdk-go in shell-script for linting - test/scripts/check_lint.sh used goimports. goimports is not a linter! it may change a source files - https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/1f2274d16a42925afb7abf60deeeca8f4581965e/test/scripts/check_lint.sh#L50 . I do not think its a good idea, if you want check missing imports, error about it is enough. 
</p>
<p><strong>sg3des</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 07:29:16 GMT):<br/>
goimports has a conflict with global variables declared in another file of same package, and may add third-party package to imports. 
</p>
<p><strong>sg3des</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 07:36:01 GMT):<br/>
example: in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/1f2274d16a42925afb7abf60deeeca8f4581965e/pkg/fabric-client/events/eventhub.go#L36 declared logger variable.
but in another file - https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/1f2274d16a42925afb7abf60deeeca8f4581965e/pkg/fabric-client/events/eventmocks.go#L281 is called `logger.Debug`. 
if i have third-party package with name *logger* and func *Debug* - goimports add it to imports list of this file. 

</p>
<p><strong>sg3des</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 07:38:13 GMT):<br/>
goimports have issue about it - https://github.com/golang/go/issues/7463 - closed, but not fixed.

package "config" - https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/config/subst.go  - why do not use environment variables?
</p>
<p><strong>sg3des</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 17:18:34 GMT):<br/>
CRYPTOCONFIG_FIXTURES_PATH - hardcoded from test packages?? what for?
</p>
<p><strong>sg3des</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 18:46:54 GMT):<br/>
instead of https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/config/subst.go - i suggest https://gist.github.com/sg3des/ff430e927ce08ac49afb0058dba8be9b, what do you think?  it replaces variables ${NAME} anywhere in the path-line.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 00:09:40 GMT):<br/>
@sg3des what change are you referring to?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 00:10:48 GMT):<br/>
@sg3des If I recall some paths are being used in unit tests, and it is not desired to use an environment variable for unit tests
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 00:11:34 GMT):<br/>
@sg3des there has been discussion about enabling variable substitution from environment but I keep forgetting about that item.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 00:12:12 GMT):<br/>
(and yes - using LookupEnv would be the way to do so)
</p>
<p><strong>sg3des</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 07:47:48 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda i want to have a possibility to use environment variable in config.

now the function substPathVars has unobvious/unexpected behavior:
1st problem  - environment variables can not be used (only GOPATH);
2nd problem - it is necessary that the variable was at the beginning of the line;

for unit tests environment variables can be declared in testing functions, ex: filename_test.go > func init(){os.Setenv(key,val)}
unit tests should prove for that package is a stable in the "real world" - but you use hardcoded values, useless for real products...

if you do not want to change the current logic, at least, replace line L92 - https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/config/subst.go#L92 - to os.LookupEnv() - that solves the 1st problem.

or so - https://gist.github.com/sg3des/e553b39066990e5aab6279534bf0ce47 - that solves the 2nd problem too, and do not break backward compatibility.
</p>
<p><strong>sg3des</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 08:01:37 GMT):<br/>
If a look more globally, i would suggest that make substitute all variables on initialize a config stage, no matter what field. That will also reduce the amount of code in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/config/config.go
</p>
<p><strong>sg3des</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 09:25:24 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda what are the third-party packages(https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/tree/master/third_party/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/) used for? why not to use vendoring if they differ from originals?

Try changing options for timeout:
</p>
<p><strong>biljana.lukovic</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 17:37:33 GMT):<br/>
  orderer:
    timeout:
      connection: 3s
      response: 5s
</p>
<p><strong>biljana.lukovic</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 17:37:55 GMT):<br/>
These should be in your config file
</p>
<p><strong>biljana.lukovic</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 17:39:21 GMT):<br/>
GRPC options for orderer should be set as:
</p>
<p><strong>biljana.lukovic</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 17:39:22 GMT):<br/>
      keep-alive-time: 0s
      keep-alive-timeout: 20s
      keep-alive-permit: false
      fail-fast: true
</p>
<p><strong>biljana.lukovic</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 17:39:59 GMT):<br/>
Zero 0 in keep-alive-time means it will not be used. The default GRPC (infinite)will be used

@sg3des we welcome contributions via gerrit (https://gerrit.hyperledger.org)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 17:42:27 GMT):<br/>
@sg3des most packages are imported from vendor with the exception of the fabric and fabric-ca projects.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 17:42:51 GMT):<br/>
(and we provide the Go dep constraints for vendored packages).
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 17:43:29 GMT):<br/>
fabric and fabric-ca are modified to be more friendly for vendoring (so they do not pull in more dependencies than are needed, for example)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 17:43:50 GMT):<br/>
those projects are treated more like internal SDK code than vendored code and are split between the internal folder and the third_party folder
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 17:43:50 GMT):<br/>
those projects are treated more like internal SDK code than vendored code and are split between the internal folder and the third_party folder (eg, the version of fabric and fabric-ca commits are locked and not intended to be changed by the application)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 17:44:32 GMT):<br/>
only code that might need to be imported by an application using the SDK is placed into third_party (like proto and proto utils)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 17:45:34 GMT):<br/>
(note: we do not check vendored code into the SDK repo for other packages)

@biljana.lukovic Thank you for the pointer, but I checked I have the same configuration as the one proposed in the tests of the SDK (with the parameters for the gRPC)

@antitoine @sg3des what are you prefixing your URLs with (grpcs://, grpc://, or nothing)? have you set allow-insecure to something?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 12:56:46 GMT):<br/>
and are your target hosts using TLS or not?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 12:57:52 GMT):<br/>
(although I don't think that should cause the error you got)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 12:57:59 GMT):<br/>
the error you have is a timeout

<p><strong>sg3des</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 12:58:13 GMT):<br/>
grpcs://
allow-insecure: true
TLS is used
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 12:58:24 GMT):<br/>
turn off allow-insecure
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 12:58:24 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 16:32:00 GMT):<br/>
the problem is happening because the channel config in the network has a different URL than the config file
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 16:32:14 GMT):<br/>
the SDK is currently obeying the channel config for URLs
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 16:32:47 GMT):<br/>
channel config has orderer.hf.chainhero.io and the config file has localhost

as a more permanent fix, either the channel config needs to be updated to match OR we need a new feature in the SDK that overrides the channel config URL

After a little while, the connection to the eventhub is cut off with this error : `[fabric_sdk_go] 2018/02/21 16:48:08 UTC - events.(*EventHub).Disconnected -> WARN EventHub was disconnected unexpectedly: rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = transport is closing`.

@troyronda you say - "your channel config needs to be updated" - whats you mean?

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 17:52:37 GMT):<br/>
The Tx file holds the config that initialized the channel
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 17:53:08 GMT):<br/>
It’s held in a ledger block that the client fetches
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 17:53:30 GMT):<br/>
One of the config items is the orderer addresses

Hi all !
Is there a way for the Hyperledger Client to delegate the data signature and/or encryption to a "ThirdParty" ?
I am asking this because I try to implement its interaction with the Secure Element and Trusted Execution Environment of an Artik..
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 17:26:14 GMT):<br/>
@ArvsIndrarys the Go SDK allows this
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 17:26:14 GMT):<br/>
@ArvsIndrarys yes - the Go SDK allows this. you need to provide a custom cryptosuite implementation.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 17:26:14 GMT):<br/>
@ArvsIndrarys yes - the Go SDK allows this. you need to provide a PKCS11 module or implement a custom cryptosuite.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 17:28:24 GMT):<br/>
the PKCS11 integration tests show an example of using PKCS11: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/pkcs11/e2e_test.go

LoggerProvider is currently used in many places,

you have to use logging.InitLogger to pass your logger provider

Hello All, This is Govinda here..I am working to use Hyperledger Fabric based solutions within enterprises. For good reasons we would like to fabric-sdk-go .. The network is set with practices mentioned on byfn.sh (boot your first network)..  The client application a go implementation using fabric-go-sdk is configured to use a configuration file... Based on this file it is able to query the network, but invoke operations which result in endorsing and require interaction with orderer internally are failing.
</p>
<p><strong>govinda-attal</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 23:23:58 GMT):<br/>
Let me share the config file.
</p>
<p><strong>govinda-attal</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 23:25:32 GMT):<br/>
A note that network is run with within docker so relevant services ports are exposed and available on host machine... but the client app which I am working on is running locally so connecting to hyperledger services via exposed ports
</p>
<p><strong>govinda-attal</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 23:32:47 GMT):<br/>

@govinda-attal sounds like the client isn't able to connect to the host
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 01:43:12 GMT):<br/>
are you running inside docker environment or against localhost
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 01:43:12 GMT):<br/>
are you running inside docker environment or against localhost?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 01:43:23 GMT):<br/>
if localhost, make sure you have set hosts entries
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 01:43:23 GMT):<br/>
if localhost, make sure you have set hosts entries (/etc/hosts to point names at 127.0.0.1)

<p><strong>govinda-attal</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 01:43:59 GMT):<br/>
The client is running outside the docker network of blockchain... So I have changed the url in config.yaml which is used by client to point to localhost:7050 for orderer
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 01:44:30 GMT):<br/>
With GRPCS or GRPC
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 01:44:56 GMT):<br/>
(i.e., TLS or not TLS)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 01:45:33 GMT):<br/>
the error usually indicates that either the client cannot find the host or that TLS is failing
</p>
<p><strong>govinda-attal</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 01:46:20 GMT):<br/>
With GRPCS, I tried that too ... having entries in /etc/hosts/ ... then it simply doesn't respond... I don't know where exactly the client is waiting for, I don't receive any events on the event listener.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 01:46:50 GMT):<br/>
@tittuvarghese 1.0.0-rc1 is very old. you could ask in other channels about configuring fabric or fabric-ca.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 01:47:20 GMT):<br/>
@govinda-attal did you set hostname override in config.yaml?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 01:47:43 GMT):<br/>
TLS will fail if you set URL to localhost but certificate has a name in it
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 01:47:43 GMT):<br/>
TLS will fail if you set URL to localhost but server's TLS certificate has a name in it
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 01:48:12 GMT):<br/>
there is a setting in config.yaml for each host where you can override the hostname.

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 01:49:10 GMT):<br/>
Also another potential problem is that the channel config is incorrect
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 01:49:34 GMT):<br/>
the client downloads the channel config from the network including ordererer addresses.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 01:50:10 GMT):<br/>
if those addresses are wrong then the client will fail to connect (and will NewAtomicBroadcastClient will specifically fail as you have above)

i recommend reviewing your channel config to see what orderer addresses you have in there

orderers:

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 02:05:11 GMT):<br/>
so do url: grpc://orderer.example.com:7050
</p>
<p><strong>govinda-attal</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 02:05:59 GMT):<br/>
this is blurb from the config.yaml... So if I understand well... I should change the url property in orderes section to grpc://orderer.example.com:7050

any success?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 02:07:51 GMT):<br/>

If I understand well... also make the orderer within the docker run with GPRC

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 02:09:41 GMT):<br/>
you need to match the client and orderer settings

in the end_to_end, we need invoke  `SaveChannel`, this will create a channel. but in production env, we do not create a new channel, just invoke chaincode in current channel. I didn't find an api to invoke chaincode without creating channel

@troyronda  ... Even when running entire solution with GRPC (not secured) still has the same problem... Query works fine... But invoke is like get an error  "context deadline exceeded"
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 02:42:46 GMT):<br/>
@govinda-attal that means client is connecting to peers but not orderer

Hi @troyronda  ,,, I think now execute' operation is working... It is coming back with results... Have a question... I am registering the ChaineCodeEvent against the channel prior to calling execute and after execute using 'select' clause trying to receive chaincode event. ... But no event is received ... Why is this registration of event and receipt of event back important
</p>
<p><strong>govinda-attal</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 03:15:29 GMT):<br/>
Question, if the client is not really interested in these events... can they be ignored ???

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 12:30:02 GMT):<br/>
@baoyangc we will probably rename NewClient to Context to make this more clear
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 12:30:58 GMT):<br/>
in any case, we are looking at adding connection caching and those connections would be shared between Contexts

@e-nikolov Not directly (although we do use the built-in context). Golang's built-in context package is a per-request context that we use for GRPC timeouts. The SDK has other scopes of context - SDK object scope (where providers, config and cache has been loaded), Identity/User Context (representing a loaded credential), Context provided to a client (eg, channel client) - largely SDK context + Identity context + channel context (if applicable). Finally we have transaction context (called TransactionHeader) containing TransactionID and other header parameters needed for a transaction.

@antitoine does that mean that the config section for orderers in the config isn't used anymore?
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 15:25:10 GMT):<br/>
it would make sense to still be able to override the genesis block config if necessary
</p>
<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 15:25:26 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that why @troyronda create this: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-8442
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 15:25:27 GMT):<br/>

@sudeshrshetty and @troyronda thanks for the LoggerProvider, it works! But I would like to come back to you because I find it a shame to have to call the InitLogging method when it is possible to give a parameter to the SDK (`WithLoggerPkg`). I mean, I don't see the point of this parameter at all.

<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 16:10:39 GMT):<br/>
 `InitLogging` will be helpful if you are using these loggers outside SDK. For example an external application which depends on SDK, want to use the SDK logger, but doesn't want to wait for SDK.New to initialize loggers.
</p>
<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 16:13:55 GMT):<br/>
All right, fine for `InitLogging`. But then `WithLoggerPkg` should call the function `InitLogging` ? Because with or without `WithLoggerPkg` , the result is the same.

Ledger queries now have a client similar to channel client
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 16:35:00 GMT):<br/>
example: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/sdk/ledger_queries_test.go
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 16:35:28 GMT):<br/>
package: github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pkg/client/ledger
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 16:36:01 GMT):<br/>
@sudeshrshetty @antitoine makes sense
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 16:37:08 GMT):<br/>
@e-nikolov @antitoine there is actually a WIP on matching the hostnames to the config (which effectively allows for override) https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/18543/
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 16:37:57 GMT):<br/>
so even if your channel config block has orderer.example.com:7050, you will be able to override the connection endpoint that using the statuc config.

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 16:38:27 GMT):<br/>
for example, see https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/18543/1/pkg/core/config/testdata/template/config.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 16:38:45 GMT):<br/>
(specifically matchPattern & substitutionURL parameters)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 19:19:11 GMT):<br/>
@antitoine @sudeshrshetty SDK calls InitLogging here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/fabsdk/fabsdk.go#L165
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 19:19:27 GMT):<br/>
so calling WithLoggerPkg is sufficient

Hey, in my project I want to upgrade my version of the fabric-sdk-go soon. When I tried to do it 3 weeks ago, I experienced a lot of deprecated functions that are still used in the e2e tests, so I did not know which functions to use and a good workflow. When do you think, all of the deprecated functions will be removed from the e2e tests?  :D
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 05 Mar 2018 14:44:52 GMT):<br/>
@Kyroy should be this week

Will there be an example for identity management too? Like register, enroll, revoke, etc. e2e right now assume that you already have a user but never mention how to enroll them.

I saw that the e2e tests were updated. But they totally use the config file for the configuration. How can I join a channel by name, without knowing the complete configuration? Previously there was the `channel.Initialize(nil)` function
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 14:26:02 GMT):<br/>
@Kyroy the channel configuration is now fetched from the peer
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 14:26:20 GMT):<br/>
you only need to have a local channel configuration when creating channels

(when joining a channel, the channel configuration is fetched from the orderer)

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 14:35:23 GMT):<br/>
@antitoine i assume you haven't called sdk.Close prior to that happening?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 14:36:01 GMT):<br/>
One possible reason for that error is the SDK has closed the connection.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 14:36:24 GMT):<br/>
This happens on sdk.Close and when the connection hasn't been used for the connectionIdle period
</p>
<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:43:45 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda I have two applications, one submitting transactions and the other reading the information. Both applications share the same configuration file (except for temporary files, such as credentials) and the same SDK initialization process. Only the application that makes requests returns this error, very rarely a request works. I tried to increase the timeouts, but I still have the same result.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:44:21 GMT):<br/>

@troyronda Ok. Out of curiosity, what exactly are you waiting for to release a first version of the SDK?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 16:23:57 GMT):<br/>
the next version is still waiting for delivery service to be merged along with the enrollment API
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 16:24:38 GMT):<br/>
hopefully those items get merged today or monday
</p>

@troyronda Hi, could you please say when i can expect the a stable tag of fabric-sdk-go?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 10 Mar 2018 21:40:08 GMT):<br/>
@sg3des the next tag is expected this coming week.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 10 Mar 2018 21:44:36 GMT):<br/>
after the next tag, i'm hoping we get feedback ... and it would be awesome to see more collaborators :).

@sg3des @antitoine fyi: the replacement for event hub has now been merged including support for fabric 1.1 delivery service and filtered blocks.

@troyronda, Hi, after upgrade SDK to the last commit, i can not join to channel `orgResMgmt.JoinChannel(channelID)` - error: "genesis block retrieval failed: error from orderer: unknown response from ordering service %!s(<nil>)". Where there can be a problem? 
</p>
<p><strong>sg3des</strong> (Sun, 11 Mar 2018 13:07:34 GMT):<br/>
P.S. Tests pass normally
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sun, 11 Mar 2018 13:34:26 GMT):<br/>
@sg3des i haven't seen that error - do the logs show anything useful?
</p>
<p><strong>sg3des</strong> (Sun, 11 Mar 2018 13:42:48 GMT):<br/>
hard to say... in debug logs from docker and from SDK, no obvious errors. Order successfuly initialized, and then, when necessary joined to channel - error.  it`s fabric-sdk logs after orderer initialization - https://pastebin.com/XyXNfZyZ

@Hangyu You must use the "master" branch which is normally compatible with all versions 1.0.x and 1.1

@Hangyu I don't think you're using the make command to run the tests. Is that the case? Place yourself at the root of the SDK and run `make`.

</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 12:15:45 GMT):<br/>
with the sdk version of thursday it worked :thinking: 
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 12:46:20 GMT):<br/>
grpcs means TLS - is the peer supporting TLS
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 12:46:20 GMT):<br/>
grpcs://localhost:7053 means TLS - is the peer supporting TLS
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 12:47:20 GMT):<br/>
yes it is, but I think the sdk is not properly sending the SSL override
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 12:47:27 GMT):<br/>
(just a guess)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 12:47:56 GMT):<br/>
Quite often TransientFailure at this point is TLS related, yes.
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 12:48:12 GMT):<br/>
because also in thrusday/friday, I had to modify my /etc/hosts to map my orderer url to localhost
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 12:48:14 GMT):<br/>
Are you using the new Mappers in your config?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 12:48:20 GMT):<br/>
no
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 12:48:31 GMT):<br/>
We added mappers to avoid needing to modify /etc/hosts
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 12:48:54 GMT):<br/>
```GRPCOptions: map[string]interface{}{
				"ssl-target-name-override": ordererConfig.GetOverride(),
			},```
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 12:48:59 GMT):<br/>
so this wont work anymore?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 12:49:08 GMT):<br/>
it should be working
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 12:49:26 GMT):<br/>
mappers just allows you to do this globally and also override the URL too.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 12:49:26 GMT):<br/>
mappers just allows you to do this more globally and also override the URL too.

<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 12:50:06 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 12:53:41 GMT):<br/>
yes mapper is not required - it's possible a bug was introduced, of course

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 12:57:50 GMT):<br/>
Override shouldn't be needed in the interface
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 12:57:59 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 12:59:36 GMT):<br/>
```core.OrdererConfig{

when I pass the `peer0.org1.example.com` here (and not localhost), it works
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 13:00:01 GMT):<br/>
of course with grps:// and port
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 15:38:36 GMT):<br/>
@Kyroy it looks like the new event client isn't obeying this option - i've asked the implementor to take a look

Another question: How to fetch the `testchainid` config (aka. Network Config) from the orderer?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 15:49:32 GMT):<br/>
There is a method called QueryConfigFromOrderer
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 15:49:53 GMT):<br/>
@Kyroy https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pkg/client/resmgmt#Client.QueryConfigFromOrderer
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 15:50:23 GMT):<br/>
Is that what you are looking for?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 15:51:01 GMT):<br/>
```type ChannelCfg interface {
ID() string
MSPs() []*msp.MSPConfig
AnchorPeers() []*OrgAnchorPeer
Orderers() []string
Versions() *Versions
}```
yes, this returns this struct. but I want to receive the (network)genesis.block 
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 15:52:15 GMT):<br/>
similar to:
```lc, err := resource.GetLastConfigFromBlock(block)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("error getting last config index from block: %v", err)
	}

	block, err = ledgerClient.QueryBlock(int(lc.Index))
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("error querying block %d: %v", lc, err)
	}

	return block, nil```

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 15:52:18 GMT):<br/>
ah. we might need to add a QueryGensisBlockFromOrderer method ... it's used underneath for creting a channel

are you using hostname override if using TLS?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Tue, 13 Mar 2018 16:33:20 GMT):<br/>
If I set the mapping in /etc/hosts, it works. so it does not use the localhost address. I think it uses the url from `ChannelConfig(name string) (*core.ChannelConfig, error)` could that be?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Tue, 13 Mar 2018 16:33:39 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I am using `ssl-target-name-override`
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Tue, 13 Mar 2018 16:36:08 GMT):<br/>
Same problem with invoke

<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Tue, 13 Mar 2018 16:36:17 GMT):<br/>
query works :) cause it does not need the orderer ;)

i thought you had an error with events?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Tue, 13 Mar 2018 16:37:32 GMT):<br/>
Yes, there was an issue. This was also related to the override ;)

guys, tell me please, how to load to peers third-party packages, or execute `go get ./...` before starting chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Mar 2018 17:37:10 GMT):<br/>
@Kyroy I think I'm missing something - it looks like you are trying to dial orderer0.example.com not localhost?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Mar 2018 17:37:29 GMT):<br/>
so you either need to use the new mappers or have that entry in /etc/hosts
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Mar 2018 17:38:00 GMT):<br/>
or dial localhost and use ssl-target-name-override
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Mar 2018 17:39:28 GMT):<br/>
by new mappers, I mean: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/config/config_test.yaml#L381
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Mar 2018 17:40:25 GMT):<br/>
@sg3des inside chaincode? you need to pre-vendor everything you are using.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 13 Mar 2018 17:40:35 GMT):<br/>
peer doesn't execute go get
</p>
<p><strong>sg3des</strong> (Tue, 13 Mar 2018 17:41:18 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Tue, 13 Mar 2018 20:13:57 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda I tried to debug, but I am sure that my config is with localhost and using ssl-override. At this point https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/fab/channel/transactor.go#L118 my client config is correct with localhost
```t.ctx.Config().OrderersConfig()=[{grpcs://localhost:7050 map[ssl-target-name-override:orderer0.example.com] {test/fixtures/node1/crypto/ordererOrganizations/example.com/orderers/orderer0.example.com/tls/ca.crt }}]```
so I think my `transactor` variable is correct (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/resmgmt/resmgmt.go#L494).
And I think this variable is also used in `createAndSendTransaction`, right?

@Kyroy we suspect that your channel config pulled from the peer has the network name not localhost
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 14 Mar 2018 21:51:51 GMT):<br/>
The current SDK uses that config to determine channel orderers
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 14 Mar 2018 21:52:19 GMT):<br/>
You can use Matchers to map the network name to localhost 
</p>

We also need to add better debug output logging in this area

should be client. RegisterChaincodeEvent

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 14:23:10 GMT):<br/>
to match the defer client.UnregisterChaincodeEvent you have later

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 14:23:31 GMT):<br/>
(or vice versa - they should match)

@zimabry FYI: this channel is about the client GO SDK not about creating Go chaincodes
</p>
<p><strong>baoyangc</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:18:08 GMT):<br/>
in the chaincode, there an function `setEvent(name string,payload []byte)`, is there a way to get the payload in the client side?

hi, i saw the latest go sdk release is v1.0.0-alpha2, is it compatible to the fabric 1.0.5/1.0.6
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 02:01:13 GMT):<br/>
if not, which version supports fabric 1.0.5/1.0.6 now? Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 02:27:27 GMT):<br/>
@baohua master
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 02:28:01 GMT):<br/>
i saw the master is already aligning with the 1.1.0-alpha?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 02:28:14 GMT):<br/>
it works with both
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 02:28:23 GMT):<br/>
and this commit is compatible with 1.0.4: * 7731bd8d - (4 months ago) [FAB-6928] Update CI to v1.0.4 - Troy Ronda?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 02:28:46 GMT):<br/>
ok, thanks

</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 02:29:10 GMT):<br/>
and what will be the next release tag?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 02:29:20 GMT):<br/>
1.0.0 or 1.1.0 directly?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 02:29:51 GMT):<br/>
alpha3 shortly
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 02:30:01 GMT):<br/>
1.1.0-alpha3?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 02:30:13 GMT):<br/>
the versions are not aligned to fabric versions
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 02:30:13 GMT):<br/>
the sdk versioning is not aligned to fabric versions
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 02:30:36 GMT):<br/>
ok, i understand, so what's the version for the next release shortly? 1.0.0-alpha3?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 02:30:59 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 02:32:27 GMT):<br/>
great, so sdk 1.0.0-alpha3 is compatible with fabric 1.0.5/1.0.6 and the fabric 1.1.0 at the same time.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 02:32:35 GMT):<br/>
that will be cool
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 02:32:47 GMT):<br/>
yes

@troyronda For my implementation project, it would be great to have a tagged version of fabric-sdk-go that does not require me to evaluate error strings in my bootstrapper when joining peers via a target filter (see FAB-7820).

When I invoke a transaction with fabric 1.0, I can get transaction ID, then using SDK to get the transaction info(but there is not any block info like block number in it), is there a way I can get which block that include the transaction by calling SDK with the transaction id ?

How to query channels that is already been created on the orderer?

<p><strong>baoyangc</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 10:11:16 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda I write a chaincode which can do transfer some coin to others. in the transfer operation,  I set an event. 
I write a client to invoke this transfer operation,  I `RegisterChaincodeEvent` in the client,  then through this client invoke transfer `100` coin to  account testuser2, but the result is  the testuser2 get 200 coin. I can't understand what happened in this progress?
if no `RegisterChaincodeEvent` in the client, the testuser2 get 100 coin.

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 20:31:39 GMT):<br/>
If you are using 1.0.0, you will need to override this default by setting eventhub in the config here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/config/config_test.yaml#L49

Hello everyone, i have 3 organizations sharing a same channel, every organization has only 1 peer, and i want to install a chaincode in all these 3 peers, so i run "install chaincode" via go-sdk in all 3 seperated scripts(using their own sdk configs), then i instantiate the chaincode from one of these peers and the chaincode container is created only for this peer. my  question is: how to instantiate the chaincode via sdk and it creates all the chaincode container(real install) in all previous installed peers. I have checked the node-sdk, they have a parameter "targets" in their instatiate function which you can asign peers to "install" the chaincode

@troyronda Thanks for providing the new delivery service! I've got two short questions: 1) in ./pkg/common/providers/fab/eventservice.go:43 it is stated that the CCEvent's payload is nil for filtered events. Indeed, I get nil payloads with a chaincode event handler registered via a channel client instance, specifying the chaincode ID and the event name. Is this the desired behaviour? If yes, how am I supposed to get the event's payload? 2) does the new delivery service solve the problem that a peer can manipulate an event at will (we've talked about this some weeks ago). I would think so, since the new delivery service seems to be channel-based, but I'm not completely sure about it.

Second point, the Logger initialization is still not good in my opinion. It works as expected with: 
```
	// Initialize SDK Logging
	sdkLogging.Initialize(logging.GetDefaultProvider())

	// Init the SDK
	sdk, err := fabsdk.New(sdkConfig.FromFile(config.GetConfigPath()))
```
But this not:
```
	// Init the SDK
	sdk, err := fabsdk.New(sdkConfig.FromFile(config.GetConfigPath()), fabsdk.WithLoggerPkg(logging.GetDefaultProvider()))
```

<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 10:27:57 GMT):<br/>
Why ?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 11:27:00 GMT):<br/>
@antitoine the SDK logger can only be initialized once per application - is the second case a second initialization?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 11:28:58 GMT):<br/>
(that one initialization is good for the life of the process)
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 12:07:01 GMT):<br/>
@ga25waq the basic idea behind filtered events is outlined in https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5481. Event payload has only enough information to allow the event recipient to query the ledger to obtain more information (beyond the fact that the transaction has successfully completed), with all access rules applied on query.
</p>
<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 13:20:07 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda No no, in the second case there is no initialization before, the two pieces of codes presented are at the same place.
</p>
<p><strong>ga25waq</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 13:30:03 GMT):<br/>
@aleksandar.likic Thanks for your quick reply! So with the new delivery service, there is no (other) way to get a chaincode event's payload set via shim.ChaincodeStubInterface.SetEvent(string, []byte)?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 13:30:35 GMT):<br/>
@antitoine yes - i see the issue.

<p><strong>ga25waq</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 14:03:28 GMT):<br/>
I'm working on a standard computer here (no high-end machine) and I had to increase the timeouts, as the creation and start of several new chaincode containers (induced by a complex endorsement policy) took some time
</p>
<p><strong>mrFranklin</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 14:03:43 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda why not release a tag of v1.1.0 for go-sdk ?  :grin:

@troyronda I've had a look into './pkg/fab/events/service/service.go'. For chaincode events, an event filter is required. How am I supposed to get unfiltered chaincode events, including the respective payload? If i register a (unfiltered) block event via RegisterBlockEvent(), as you suggested, I naturally get get pure blocks which I would have to manually extract the needed information out of.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 15:02:57 GMT):<br/>
@ga25waq we are working on adding an events client for non-filtered cases
</p>
<p><strong>ga25waq</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 15:03:27 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda That's cool, thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 15:03:45 GMT):<br/>
in the channel client, the filter is a regular expression
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 15:03:45 GMT):<br/>
in the channel client, the filter for the Handle func is a regular expression

in the channel client, the filter for the Register func is a regular expression
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 15:03:57 GMT):<br/>
it really needs a better GoDoc
</p>
<p><strong>ga25waq</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 15:04:39 GMT):<br/>
But the event filter '(.*)' does not lead to an unfiltered chaincode event, does it?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 15:04:54 GMT):<br/>
no it's a filter on the filtered events
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 15:04:55 GMT):<br/>
:)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 15:05:09 GMT):<br/>
the events client will have unfiltered events
</p>
<p><strong>ga25waq</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 15:06:01 GMT):<br/>
Okay. For now, I'm switching back to the eventhub model. It still works with Fabric 1.1 (surprisingly?).
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 15:07:42 GMT):<br/>

Just to let everyone know: After updating to Go v1.10 on my Mac, I got the error when running my HLF app:
`cannot use nil as type _Ctype_CFDataRef in assignment - cfssl 1.3.0 go1.10 macos` 
If you get this, just do:
`go get -u github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/cmd/cfssl` It will take a couple of seconds longer than usual when doing a `go get` but in the end it works.

Hi, do I have to use fabric-ca for the certificates when using fabric-sdk-go? Can i use cryptogen tool to generate keys and certs instead?
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Mon, 26 Mar 2018 11:20:15 GMT):<br/>
@lignyxg User identity is resolved by looking up the user enrollment cert first, and then looking up the matching private key. You should be able to use any tool, as long as you put the resulting cert and key in proper places. When resolving the cert, SDK first looks at the user store (@client.credentialStore.path); if cert is found, the key is looked up in the crypto provider key store (HSM or @client.credentialStore.cryptoStore.path). If the identity is not resolved, SDK looks up embedded certs in client configuration; if not found, it looks up the org's MSP directory (@organizations.<org>.cryptoPath). If not found, "user not found" is reported. Otherwise, the matching private key is first searched in embedded keys in client configuration, then in the crypto provider key store, and finally in the org's MSP directory. The whole setup essentially attempts to support three use cases: embedded credentials in client configuration, pre-enrolled users in the org's MSP directory, and dynamically enrolled users - when the cert is in the user store and the key in the crypto provider's key store. There are naming conventions used by default implementations of the MSP store and user store. You need to follow them if you want to plant your externally generated certs there. To make sure you understand the conventions correctly, try to study and run https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/msp/enrollment_test.go, and observe how the newly enrolled user's cert and private key are stored . You can also implement your own cert store and let the SDK use it - see https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/msp/user_data_mgmt_test.go. Default org MSP store follows the format generated by the fabric cryptogen tool. Finally, you can implement your own MSP provider to have complete control over enrollment process (but that's for another tutorial). I'll try to put this information into some SDK readme file in the next week or so. Hope this helps.

Otherwise, the matching private key is first searched in embedded keys in client configuration, then in the crypto provider key store, and finally in the org's MSP directory. The whole setup essentially attempts to support three use cases: embedded credentials in client configuration, pre-enrolled users in the org's MSP directory, and dynamically enrolled users - when the cert is in the user store and the key in the crypto provider's key store. There are naming conventions used by default implementations of the MSP store and user store. You need to follow them if you want to plant your externally generated certs there. To make sure you understand the conventions correctly, try to study and run https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/msp/enrollment_test.go, and observe how the newly enrolled user's cert and private key are stored . You can also implement your own cert store and let the SDK use it - see https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/msp/user_data_mgmt_test.go. Default org MSP store follows the format generated by the fabric cryptogen tool. Finally, you can implement your own MSP provider to have complete control over enrollment process (but that's for another tutorial). I'll try to put this information into some SDK readme file in the next week or so. Hope this helps.

Hi, I‘ve been trying to run end_to_end test with local fabric network launched by docker-compose, I used config_test_local.yaml for the configuration and pointed cryptopath to the peer and orderer's MSP directory respectively, but when i run the test, I got this error:
"`create channel failed: SendEnvelope failed: calling orderer 'localhost:7050' failed: Orderer Client Status Code: (2) CONNECTION_FAILED. Description: dialing connection timed out [localhost:7050]`"  from sdk side, and got this error:
"`grpc: Server.Serve failed to create ServerTransport:  connection error: desc = "transport: http2Server.HandleStreams received bogus greeting from client:...`" from the orderer side, did I miss something or did I do something wrong about the configuration? :dizzy_face:

make dockerenv-stable-up
and then in another shell:
make configFile=config_test_local.yaml integration-tests-local
and all worked. I would start with these out of the box files and make small changes until you hit the problem.

@aleksandar.likic Thanks for your reply, I did the test manually step by step trying to figure out the inside work flow, I think I did wrong about the org name and org msp id in crypto-config.yaml, configtx.yaml in fabric and config_test_local.yaml in sdk, they didn't match each other, so after corrected, now I got another error when creating channel through sdk:
`Orderer Server Status Code: (400) BAD_REQUEST. Description: Attempted to include a member which is not in the consortium`
still no luck...maybe there's still something wrong with the configuration, i'll keep trying

@troyronda When I call sdk to create and join channel with channelID not equal mychannel/orgchannel, I got error "failed to find orderer for request: orderer not found: orderers lookup failed: Unable to retrieve channel config", I find the error is cofing_test.yaml not have channel config setting, and then call ResMgmt.saveChannel with resmgmt.WithOrdererURL("orderer.example.com") options will solve the problem, but when I create/join channel successfully and failed to create channelClient

@StevenXu it sounds like you were able to create/join channel using WithOrdererURL. What error did you get from channel client New?

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 01:47:54 GMT):<br/>
@StevenXu you can override the discovery service using this SDK option: https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pkg/fabsdk#WithServicePkg
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 01:48:18 GMT):<br/>
(by implementing CreateDiscoveryProvider)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 01:49:37 GMT):<br/>
there is an example of a related override here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/sdk/sdk_provider_test.go#L47
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 01:50:25 GMT):<br/>
We'd have to see if there is something that makes sense for the built-in discovery service when no config is provided
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 01:52:07 GMT):<br/>
but like I said, the default one is already overridable
</p>
<p><strong>StevenXu</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 01:53:30 GMT):<br/>
I want to make sure if channel name is random, Is the way work?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 01:55:16 GMT):<br/>
The SDK uses the discovery provider to obtain peers based on a channel ID
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 01:55:37 GMT):<br/>
so you can customize the peers returned based on the channel ID
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 01:55:48 GMT):<br/>
or you can even ignore the channel ID and always return the same peers
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 01:56:01 GMT):<br/>
up to your needs :)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 01:57:59 GMT):<br/>
the default discovery provider uses the config file to do this work
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 01:59:26 GMT):<br/>
(but like I mentioned, you can make your own that doesn't rely on config file)
</p>
<p><strong>StevenXu</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 02:00:18 GMT):<br/>

@troyronda I think we should add channel config inject func, channels config defind some diff channel type with diff policy or peer ..., when we create new channel, we can choose the channel type to create, It will be more flexible for multi orgs

Hi, I don't quite understand the `DynamicSelectionProvider/DynamicSelectionProviderFactory`, i noticed the difference between func `testWithOrg1` and `testWithOrg2` is that the `testWithOrg1` has to `load Org Peers` and set targets by `channel.WithTargets()` manually when interacting with chaincode，while `testWithOrg2` doesn't. It seems the dynamic selection obtains targets in the config_test_xxx.yaml(because when org2's peers are deleted in channel configuration part of config_test_xxx.yaml, I got the error `Failed to move funds: Client Status Code: (6) NO_PEERS_FOUND. Description: targets were not provided`), but comment(multiple_orgs_test.go, line 383) says dynamic selection will inspect chaincode policy to determine endorsers, that sounds like targets are not obtained from config_test_xxx.yaml, so what's the real thing?
</p>
<p><strong>lignyxg</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 15:13:17 GMT):<br/>
After running multiple_orgs_test successfully(org2's peers were added in the channel configuration part of config_test_xxx.yaml), I commented out the first func call `testWithOrg1` and ran `testWithOrg2` alone in `TestOrgsEndToEnd`, I got error 
`panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference

was it wrong to run `testWithOrg2` alone? But I don't see the necessary connection bewteen `testWithOrg1` and `testWithOrg2` that `testWithOrg2` must run after `testWithOrg1` within one execution?

@lignyxg The idea behind dynamic selection is to have the SDK automatically select the set of endorsers so the application doesn't have to deal with it. Dynamic selection works with current channel configuration (which changes as peers join / drop off), as well as the chaincode endorsement policy. Note that the channel configuration is read from a peer, not from the client configuration. Also, if any peers fail during endorsement, SDK will retry the endorsement with a new set of peers.

@pankajcheema SDK does automatically fall back to other orderer(s) defined in client config, in case the first one fails. SDK discovery currently doesn't support orderers (this should be added to the SDK), so all of them have to be in client config.
Peer discovery is there, so only one peer (on the target channel) has to be in client config - others are discovered. SDK maintains an up to date information of all peers on the channel as the peers join the channel or go off. Dynamic peer selection allows the app to leave peer selection to the SDK - SDK will assure that correct combination of peers on the target channel are chosen for endorsement, based on the transaction policy and current network configuration. Also, in case of error, SDK will automatically retry the transaction endorsement with a new set of peers.

Hello, I have a question for go sdk: When I instantiate a chaincode on a channal, which includes 2 orgs, there will be just 1 org's chaincode containers running? And when I invoke to another org's peer, it'll build it's chaincode container, that makes my invoke so slow.

@pankajcheema Let me correct myself: Channel configuration (which can be queried from a peer on the channel) contains information on all peers and orderers on the channel (among other info). This information is used by SDK, so if the app doesn't specify any targets for a transaction, SDK will automatically choose correct peers and orderers for the transaction. It will also perform retries on endorsement / commit by failing over to other peers/orderers from the channel configuration. This means that the app needs only a single peer in the configuration in order to transact with Fabric. This assumes the peer is trusted by the app (so the channel configuration queried from the peer is deemed genuine). If peers are not trusted, SDK needs to query channel configuration from multiple peers and to compare results, thus more than one peer in local configuration. App can specify channel.<chname>.policies.queryChannelConfig.minResponses to control the minimum number of peers required when querying the channel configuration. The default is 1.

@xuchenhao001 Looks like you are deploying examplecc? The error you are getting means that examplecc is already deployed on this channel. Chancodes are deployed to a channel, not to org. Orgs join their peers to a channel to let their clients execute transactions on the channel.

@aleksandar.likic yes, I know that. But how can I build all chaincode container for all of the peers on the channel at one time?
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Sat, 07 Apr 2018 01:52:59 GMT):<br/>
@xuchenhao001 Take a look at http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/install_instantiate.html?highlight=instantiate. Installing has to be done on each peer where you want to have it, as it involves copying the CC code to the peer. It is not recorded on the ledger. Instantiate is a transaction on the ledger that has to be endorsed by a number (generally a subset) of peers on the channel that have the CC installed. Other peers (that didn't participate in the endorsement) will be notified appropriately and will eventually install the CC without client intervention. So if you successfully installed CC on org1 peers, you are done.

</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Sat, 07 Apr 2018 02:11:38 GMT):<br/>
@xuchenhao001 Roughly yes. Otherwise, I think that the chaincode container is built by the peer on the first call from the client, when the peer detects the container is not present.

By the way, how can I express my policy "signed by all of the peers" in `fabric-sdk-go`? I just found that `ccPolicy := cauthdsl.SignedByAnyMember([]string{"Org1MSP", "Org2MSP"})` is `Set up chaincode policy to 'any of two msps'`
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Sat, 07 Apr 2018 03:14:46 GMT):<br/>
@xuchenhao001 "signed by all peers" doesn't look like a meaningful policy. A policy is used to engage multiple parties (orgs) during  endorsement, as a single party is not generally trusted. Are you just trying to execute instantiate on all peers? For that you should use WithTargets option to explicitly set the endorsing peers.

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 10:50:39 GMT):<br/>
Since the fabric core has a reference implementation of the discovery client, I decided to enhance it with some smarter endorser selection:
`Endorsers(string, hint Selection) (Endorsers, error)`
To be able to prefer endorsers by their ledger height, and also to be able to exclude endorsers from being selected which is useful if a peer is dead / unreachable and we don't want the random selection logic to select it. 
Here is a WIP change set https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/20371/2/discovery/client/selection.go
I'd appreciate your feedback on this as your SDK already has ServiceDiscover client support and you also might know use cases which I am not aware of.

according to Fabric's doc, MSP is a bunch of folders or a component which defines org relationship and includes a lot of cert, keys. CA is just a term in PKI, which issue certs. I think there is some difference between them

@yacovm One thing that the SDK currently has is the ability to specify multiple chaincodes and evaluate a policy that combines the policies of the chaincodes (i.e. for the case that one CC invokes another). Have you thought about this use case for the client?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 12:25:18 GMT):<br/>
also - I'm adding a function to verify that the `Membership` inner pointer is not nil... seems like https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/20321/5/pkg/client/common/discovery/dynamicdiscovery/service.go@116 doesn't have a nil check and so does (not) my `client.go` :) 

> for the case that one CC invokes another
I have but didn't get to it yet :( 
It's not in my top priorities because I need to support also meta-policies like Majority, etc.
When I'll work on that - I'll add support for a union of endorsement policies by simply constructing a policy tree that is a root vertex and the policies are the sub-trees of the root, and then I'll change the API accordingly. 
I was thinking of making the `chaincode string` a var-args string or something

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 12:56:19 GMT):<br/>
(the discovery service is implemented fully in the go SDK, right? you just fetch the policy and compute the peers or something like that, right?)

We are doing a lot of CC2CC - although, so far, we've only been specifying complex policies on the first CC invoked so the feature hasn't really been used.
</p>
<p><strong>bstasyszyn</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 13:02:54 GMT):<br/>
Yes, selection is fully implemented but it was always meant to be temporary - I have an outstanding task to replace it with your Discovery service
</p>
<p><strong>bstasyszyn</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 13:05:47 GMT):<br/>
To clarify, yes, multiple CCs are currently supported - the policies are combined

hey guys, sorry for bothering you with newbie questions but when I try to ```clientContext := sdk.Context(fabsdk.WithUser(orgAdmin), fabsdk.WithOrg(Org))

	_, err = resmgmt.New(clientContext)```
I got `failed to create resmgmt client: user not found`, and idk at which part of config file the user is defined, as the e2e example I've set my variables as const 
```const (
	channelID = "mainchannel"
	orgName   = "FundacaoRenovaMSP"
	orgAdmin  = "Admin@renova.org"
	Org       = "org1"
	ccID      = "poc-barragem"
)```

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=Pdqua8yuW3pCdyE8s) Keep in mind that the client has to have a privilege to receive block events. For regular app clients this is typically not the case, as you normally don't want to reveal all transaction details to just any client. Instead, they can subscribe for filtered events (just omit WithBlockEvents), and perform query (of the data they have access to) upon receiving the event (notification that data is ready).

@troyronda , @bstasyszyn  - I plan to start working tomorrow on service discovery for collections (after finished with https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/20445/ )
How does your SDK use that feature? Do you know upfront what collections the chaincode writes to? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 19:08:53 GMT):<br/>
Does it make sense that if the chaincode query contains a set of collections, it will return an EP descriptor that satisfies the EP of the collection? I assume that the endorsement policy of the chaincode can be satisfied by the membership of the collection (otherwise it wouldn't get into the ledger)

 What kind of crypto material does Go SDK use?

According to my understanding, a client communicating with chaincode must a crypto materials like private key and certificates. 

The official example using NodeJS SDK is fetching these from CA server, and use those to identify itself.  Those material's format is totally different from what I can see inside MSP folder of peer/orderer nodes. 

So does Go SDK also have to rely on CA server, or can it just use MSP folder created by cryptogen like peer/orderer binaries?

<p><strong>bstasyszyn</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:10:01 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm Currently the SDK doesn't use collection policies to select endorsers - and the client doesn't know the collections being used by a chaincode - so I'm not sure how best to make use of collection policies
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:11:12 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm @bstasyszyn one thing we wanted to be careful about is having the knowledge that peers are out-of-date on the collection policy or channel configuration.

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:11:37 GMT):<br/>
well but i provide the ledger height
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:11:43 GMT):<br/>
that solves the out of date problem no?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:12:10 GMT):<br/>
the client also needs to know the current collection policy (height) once this is implemented
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:12:28 GMT):<br/>
or won't know if the peer is out-of-date.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:12:50 GMT):<br/>
(once updateable collection policies are available)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:13:38 GMT):<br/>
but - if you query a peer that is up to date
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:13:47 GMT):<br/>
and the peer returns to you only orgs that are in the collection
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:13:50 GMT):<br/>
i don't see what is the problem?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:15:08 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm were you planning to have two separate mechanisms? one to pick peers based on a chaincode and the other to pick peers based on a collection?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:16:32 GMT):<br/>
ah so - what i do right now
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:16:46 GMT):<br/>
for cc2cc for instance 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:16:57 GMT):<br/>
i look at the peers that have the ccs installed and get their MSP IDs
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:16:57 GMT):<br/>
i look at the peers that have the all ccs installed on them and get their MSP IDs
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:17:07 GMT):<br/>
then, I compute the endorsement descriptors (options of endorsements)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:17:35 GMT):<br/>
and prune from that - all combinations of endorsements that have in them MSP IDs that are not in the set of the set of the installed chaincode set msp ids
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:17:47 GMT):<br/>
(did you understand? I hope i'm not too cryptic)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:20:14 GMT):<br/>
sure
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:20:28 GMT):<br/>
so i'm asking
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:20:32 GMT):<br/>
(after reading a couple times :)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:21:46 GMT):<br/>
yes?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:22:28 GMT):<br/>
the client sends the discovery service a list of collections
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:22:56 GMT):<br/>
the service,  only serves back endorsement options such that every option has only peers that are in all collections
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:22:58 GMT):<br/>
right?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:23:14 GMT):<br/>
because - you need to do "PutState" in all of them, and then the public (hashed RWSet) should match
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:23:14 GMT):<br/>
because - you need to do "PutPrivateState" in all of them, and then the public (hashed RWSet) should match
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:23:21 GMT):<br/>
correct? (doing sanity check)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:26:38 GMT):<br/>
So I think there are two core reasons for restricting the peer list:
(1) ReadPrivateState would fail if a client chooses an peer that wasn't in the collection
(2) Confidentiality - some use cases want to restrict the orgs that see the endorsement
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:27:02 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:27:06 GMT):<br/>
The first reason, of course, seems like a hard rule.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:27:17 GMT):<br/>
The second reason has a It Depends on it.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:27:17 GMT):<br/>
The second reason has an It Depends on it.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:28:10 GMT):<br/>
You could even make the argument that the second reason isn't strictly related to collections
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:28:20 GMT):<br/>
(It can also apply to transient parameters)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:28:20 GMT):<br/>
(It can also potentially apply to transient parameters)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:28:34 GMT):<br/>
not sure what is the point you're trying to make
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:28:45 GMT):<br/>
do you agree with my statement?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:29:56 GMT):<br/>
Sorry let me try further.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:31:09 GMT):<br/>
I agree that in some/many cases, a filter using collections is useful. 
</p>

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:31:09 GMT):<br/>
I agree that in some/many cases, a filter using collection names is useful where the intersection is taken. 
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:33:58 GMT):<br/>
Particularly where the use case has a ReadPrivateState in it.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:34:30 GMT):<br/>
There can be cases where no ReadPrivateState occurs and its okay for other peers to be involved in the endorsement.

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:34:30 GMT):<br/>
There can be cases where no ReadPrivateState occurs and its okay for other peers to be involved in the endorsement - likely filtered by MSP / Org ID.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:35:27 GMT):<br/>
There can be cases unrelated to collections where a further filter on MSP / Org ID can be desired (like transient data).
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:35:58 GMT):<br/>
oh but Troy - if there is no read / write of private data
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:36:01 GMT):<br/>
In the case where it's okay for other peers to be involved, I guess the client would just omit the collection name from the filter.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:36:10 GMT):<br/>
you can just .... not pass the collections
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:36:12 GMT):<br/>
in the API call
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:36:13 GMT):<br/>
no?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:36:32 GMT):<br/>
it's up to you how you use the client
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:36:49 GMT):<br/>
the service discovery only computes the stuff for you - but it doesn't care for what purpose you use it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:37:14 GMT):<br/>
ah that's what you said
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:37:16 GMT):<br/>
I agree - I'm cryptically making the point that someone can do a WritePrivateData without a ReadPrivateData :)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:37:28 GMT):<br/>
like a blind write
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:37:30 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:37:36 GMT):<br/>

func WithIdentity(signingIdentity msp.SigningIdentity) ContextOption {

<p><strong>govinda-attal</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 02:51:02 GMT):<br/>
Hello All. Hope you find this message well... I have a query, is it a common use case that CA can be used to issue certificate(s) for normal users like bob, alice etc (say managed by existing ldap etc). And then applications are implemented to use certificates issued for users instead of apps (post authentication of user against LDAP) to create channel client and call chain code operations? `sdk.ChannelContext(channelID, fabsdk.WithUser(orgName), fabsdk.WithIdentity(signID))`
</p>
<p><strong>govinda-attal</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 02:53:23 GMT):<br/>
And signID is extracted by `mspClient.GetSigningIdentity(identityName)`
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 02:55:54 GMT):<br/>
@baoyangc SigningIdentity cannot be created without registering and enrolling a user. During registration and enrollment user information (enrollment cert, private key) is stored into SDK stores. SDK client can then obtain the user's signing identity by calling mspClient.GetSigningIdentity(username), as here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/66ac24ed71b56271aa6e47889178a927acd84ac2/test/integration/msp/enrollment_test.go#L100
</p>
<p><strong>govinda-attal</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 02:56:31 GMT):<br/>
This is like total runtime so that users login with credentials, and later their certificates are used to connect to channel and execute chain code operations... Is it valid use-case? or typically only few certificates are issued to say *apps *and app specific certificates are used to invoke operations on chaincode on behalf of these conventional users which are managed in separate infrastructure like LDAP or AD or something else?
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 03:08:12 GMT):<br/>
@govinda-attal Fabric supports both use cases, but then any traditional database does too. This question is, however, beyond the scope of this channel, you would be better off posting it to general or some other fabric channel.
</p>
<p><strong>govinda-attal</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 03:11:34 GMT):<br/>
Cool, thank you @aleksandar.likic ... I will post on generic channel too  Also, I was trying to find go sdk how to register/enroll a user with custom attributes ?? Is that feasible in go-sdk and if yes any pointers would help :-)
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 03:12:37 GMT):<br/>
@govinda-attal Yes, see https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/66ac24ed71b56271aa6e47889178a927acd84ac2/test/integration/msp/enrollment_test.go#L67

</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 03:16:49 GMT):<br/>
@govinda-attal Note that the attributes have Ecert: true. This means that they will be included in any cert issued to the user. Setting Ecert: false, would (I think) make the attribute optional, so they wouldn't be included by default in new certs. Instead, their inclusion would have to be explicitly requested during enrollment. go-sdk currently doesn't support this use case.

<p><strong>govinda-attal</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 03:24:15 GMT):<br/>
@aleksandar.likic  Thanks for that! I am wondering how this would work with identity mixer concept if the certificates are in a given use-case to be totally anonymous, even though these certificates have attributes. So I believe when anonymous but valid certificates are issued attribute based control doesn't make sense ??

<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 03:28:05 GMT):<br/>
@govinda-attal I think this depends whether or not your attributes can be used to identify the user, but this is also beyond the scope of this channel. There are far more knowledgable people in other channels who could better answer this.

thanks for your reply.
another question: how to avoid error: ```create channel client failed with error: event service creation failed: Channel_Cfg_Cache - cache is closed"```
could I create channel client without getting channel config from the peers or the orderers
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 03:32:49 GMT):<br/>
Channel client reads channel configuration from a peer associated with the channel in sdk configuration. The assumption is that the client wants to submit transaction proposal to a set of peers on the channel, and then subsequently submits endorsed transaction to the orderer. Is your question in the context of your scenario where you want the sdk to act like a simple proxy and just send already signed proposals/transactions to peers and orderer?
</p>
<p><strong>baoyangc</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 05:17:19 GMT):<br/>
yes @aleksandar.likic 
</p>
<p><strong>baoyangc</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 05:19:18 GMT):<br/>
I think we should make the sdk read the channel config from file  ```config.yaml```
</p>
<p><strong>baoyangc</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 05:19:38 GMT):<br/>
not from a peer on the channel.
</p>
<p><strong>baoyangc</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 05:23:47 GMT):<br/>
do we have an method to avoid error: ```create channel client failed with error: event service creation failed: Channel_Cfg_Cache - cache is closed"```

@vinayak03 Sorry, I didn't realize it's you who posted a comment few minutes ago on the tutorial page
</p>
<p><strong>MaximeAubanel</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:12:08 GMT):<br/>
I didn't get that your question was related to the tutorial, my bad.
</p>
<p><strong>MaximeAubanel</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:12:46 GMT):<br/>
@vinayak03 Why are you executing `f`
</p>
<p><strong>MaximeAubanel</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:12:46 GMT):<br/>
@vinayak03 Why are you executing `make populate` in fabric-sdk-go folder ?

yeah after that there is make step

<p><strong>vinayak03</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:16:17 GMT):<br/>
that is also giving the same result

@nmarcetic did you have this issue too ?
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:21:19 GMT):<br/>
Hm, no I didn't run `make depend-install`` at all... Its a section under `Running test suits` I don't want to run any test... Now I run the `make depend-install` no errors 
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:22:44 GMT):<br/>
@MaximeAubanel Does this step is really mandatory ? Just to use sdk ? 
</p>
<p><strong>MaximeAubanel</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:24:32 GMT):<br/>
Well, we are using the SDK go in order to communicate with Fabric. If the SDK Go got some dependences, It's better to have them right ?
</p>
<p><strong>MaximeAubanel</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:24:53 GMT):<br/>
But if you don't want to execute any test, you don't NEED to do that.
</p>
<p><strong>vinayak03</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:25:20 GMT):<br/>
@nmarcetic Error is occuring in make command after running make depend-install
</p>
<p><strong>MaximeAubanel</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:26:05 GMT):<br/>
To conclude, you don't need to execute `make depend-install` and `make` if you don't want to test if the SDK Go is working correctly on your computer.
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:26:32 GMT):<br/>
@MaximeAubanel  Yes but there is a lot easier way to do it then running a .sh script :) Like using dep tool or vendor etc... This looks really hacky
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:26:55 GMT):<br/>
Ah `, you don't need to execute `make depend-install` and `make` if you don't want to test if the SDK Go is working correctly on your co` Make sense now :)
</p>
<p><strong>MaximeAubanel</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:28:12 GMT):<br/>
@nmarcetic I got you bro ! We used dep in the tutorial. What you just seen have been made by the SDK Go dev :)

</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:32:10 GMT):<br/>
Check from this, they make blockchain.go file https://github.com/chainHero/heroes-service/blob/9e3736d512f4aa9d56b42ce6d67d6cd705cc6e3f/README.md#b-initialise
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:32:25 GMT):<br/>
Then from main.go they are using blockchain package to Init the sdk setup
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:32:50 GMT):<br/>
```
// FabricSetup implementation
type FabricSetup struct {
	ConfigFile      string
	ChannelID       string
	initialized     bool
	ChannelConfig   string
	OrgAdmin        string
	OrgName         string
	admin           resmgmt.ResourceMgmtClient
	sdk             *fabsdk.FabricSDK
}
```
See the struct 
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:33:15 GMT):<br/>
See how they are calling FabricSetup from main.go
https://github.com/chainHero/heroes-service/blob/9e3736d512f4aa9d56b42ce6d67d6cd705cc6e3f/README.md#c-test
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:33:33 GMT):<br/>
and passing this ChannelConfig which is a huge  yml config :)
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:33:38 GMT):<br/>
Do I really need this ?
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:34:17 GMT):<br/>
You can also see from here 
```
// Initialize the SDK with the configuration file
	sdk, err := fabsdk.New(config.FromFile(setup.ConfigFile))
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to create sdk: %v", err)
	}
```

<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:34:24 GMT):<br/>

@MaximeAubanel I started to work on fabric-token, its a fork from @vadimuvin I fix it to work with fabric v1.1 the the chaincode part was easy game :) Now I want to build a wallet using fabric-sdk-go which is not easy at all :D

</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:43:52 GMT):<br/>
this is a chaincode fork
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:44:47 GMT):<br/>
I know that fabric does not support it nativaly, but its very common case and easy to build it with chaincode actually, so why not ;)
</p>
<p><strong>MaximeAubanel</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:45:24 GMT):<br/>
Why not using a private Ethereum blockchain ?
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:45:43 GMT):<br/>
Because its a public BC network :) And does not support channels etc...
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:45:58 GMT):<br/>
No roles, no channels, privacy etc...
</p>
<p><strong>MaximeAubanel</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:46:08 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, indeed haha
</p>
<p><strong>MaximeAubanel</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:48:26 GMT):<br/>
@nmarcetic You created this repository one year ago :p
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:49:48 GMT):<br/>
@MaximeAubanel Ah no its a fork from `vadimuvin/fabric-token` the guy from Swiss blockchain he did it with some old version of fabric a year ago, then I fork it and fix it to work with fabric 1.1 
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 13:52:31 GMT):<br/>
Its much bigger community around fabric-sdk-node version and composer, so your turtorial is really helpful (the only one I found so far). So thank you ;) And thank's again for your answers, time savers ;)

@nmarcetic you can alternatively provide a configuration backend if you don't want to use a config file
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 14:30:37 GMT):<br/>
(a configuration backend is basically a key/value lookup)
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 14:31:39 GMT):<br/>
Under the covers, config.FromFile is exposing this interface to the SDK.
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 14:33:05 GMT):<br/>
@MaximeAubanel Will check about ConfigBackend, sounds more generic ;)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 14:33:15 GMT):<br/>
the key strings being used are what you'd expect from viper
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 14:33:34 GMT):<br/>
(i.e., period seperated matching the sections in the YAML file)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 14:34:48 GMT):<br/>
there is also WIP to create an integration test/example with minimized configuration, using APIs and bootstrap peers instead.
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 14:35:36 GMT):<br/>
Sounds good 
</p>
<p><strong>MaximeAubanel</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 15:17:07 GMT):<br/>
@nmarcetic As you want. But if I'm not saying something wrong you will need to provide the same information than we do in the config file. So at the end, I guess it's more convenient to use a config file. My opinion tho
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 15:23:57 GMT):<br/>
@MaximeAubanel of course it depends on what you are doing :)

@MaximeAubanel @troyronda  Recording to my questions about config.yml file for fabric-sdk-go I have one more question :) 
For example in hero-service example app I see crypto-conf with a lot of pre generated keys 
https://github.com/chainHero/heroes-service/blob/master/config.yaml#L32
This is a crypto-config folder 
https://github.com/chainHero/heroes-service/tree/master/fixtures/crypto-config
My question is do I need to have all this ? If so how I can generate it, for example using crypto-gen tool or ? 
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 12:46:57 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 16:29:35 GMT):<br/>
Hi,

Can someone help me with the following problem? 

I get an error message when setting up the network and trying to instal the chaincode

`Unable to install and instantiate the chaincode: get channel config failed: Channel_Cfg_Cache - cache is closed`

The phrase ‘get channel config failed’ comes from `resmgmt.go` around line 635 in the method `sendCCProposal`.

I think the error is generated because the parameter `opts` give this strange output:
```
opts is:  {[] <nil> <nil> map[] <nil> {5 1s 1m0s 2.5 map[Event Server Status:[MISSING_ENDORSEMENT CHAINCODE_ERROR 11 12] gRPC Transport Status:[14] Endorser Client Status:[ENDORSEMENT_MISMATCH PREMATURE_CHAINCODE_EXECUTION] Endorser Server Status:[503 500] Orderer Server Status:[503 500 400 404]]}}
```

and the mistake is (possibly) generated here
`chConfig, err := channelService.ChannelConfig()` because `chConfig` gives `nil`, just below where the error message is generated. 

Thanks
</p>

There is a softhsm2 implementation of the bccsp interface in the sdk, does it only work with a local installation of the softhsm or can it also use a remote one?
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 17:18:29 GMT):<br/>
Also is there a plan to eventually support something like hashicorp's vault for secret management?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:46:07 GMT):<br/>
@e-nikolov it's a pkcs11 implementation
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:46:19 GMT):<br/>
you can supply pkcs11 libs in the config
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:46:19 GMT):<br/>
i.e., you can supply pkcs11 libs in the config
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:47:02 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:48:26 GMT):<br/>
This file is a part of what brought me here 
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:48:42 GMT):<br/>
to ask if it is possible to use a remote hsm
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:48:52 GMT):<br/>
but I guess at the moment it needs direct access to the .so files
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:49:09 GMT):<br/>
those .so files can hit remote HSMs.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:49:27 GMT):<br/>
if you have a PCKS11 impl that does so
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:49:42 GMT):<br/>
aha
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:49:54 GMT):<br/>
what about vault?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:50:11 GMT):<br/>
i haven't used vault so I'm not sure if they have PKCS11 support.
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:50:30 GMT):<br/>
they support pkcs11 as a backend
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:50:40 GMT):<br/>
but provide an http api 
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:50:53 GMT):<br/>
to access the hsm
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:51:15 GMT):<br/>
we only have PKCS11 and SW provided in the SDK... of course, someone can make a new cryptosuite impl and pass it in.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:51:31 GMT):<br/>
using PKCS11 as an example (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/tree/master/pkg/core/cryptosuite/bccsp/pkcs11)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:51:31 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:52:05 GMT):<br/>
If I write a vault implementation of the bccsp interface, would you guys be interested in adding it to the sdk?
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:52:50 GMT):<br/>
I think vault provides a good abstraction layer over many possible backends
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:53:04 GMT):<br/>
it supports PKCS11 as well as things like consul and etcd
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:53:12 GMT):<br/>
I'm not too familiar with it, but it seems like a good idea
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:53:12 GMT):<br/>
I'm not too familiar with it, but it seems like a good idea to me
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:53:37 GMT):<br/>
it also supports the HSM offering of AWS and other cloud providers
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:53:42 GMT):<br/>
nice
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:53:53 GMT):<br/>
but it requires vault enterprise
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:54:10 GMT):<br/>
so I guess it's more of a separate feature for the people who really need it
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:54:18 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:54:55 GMT):<br/>
but people would still have the choice to use the pkcs11 bccsp if they don't want vault enterprise edition
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:55:40 GMT):<br/>
also extensions like enterprise edition can exist anywhere on github and can still be used with the SDK
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:55:59 GMT):<br/>
PKCS11 support isn't even directly referenced by the out of the box SDK
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:56:01 GMT):<br/>
;)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:56:09 GMT):<br/>
it just happens to be in the same repo
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:56:22 GMT):<br/>
and is exercised by the CI tests
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:56:55 GMT):<br/>
you just need this line: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/pkcs11/e2e_test.go#L25
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 18:57:11 GMT):<br/>

Hi everyone, does anybody know why the client needs to connect to Fabric -CA during the client sdk initialization, that seems to save the enrolled use under /tmp/enroll_user,  what's this user used for? it seems later transactions use orgUser's context to send.

@troyronda Is there a chance that the bug mentioned in FAB-9068 gets fixed soon? Unfortunately, it is not currently not possible to use the automatic creation of CouchDB indexes introduced in Fabric 1.1, which leads to disadvantages w.r.t. the performance and the impossibility of using CouchDB's sorting functionality.

<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 13:51:50 GMT):<br/>
I am a bit confused about the relationship between the BCCSP and the users in the embedded config or crypto path
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 13:52:02 GMT):<br/>
can someone help me clear this up for myself
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 13:52:48 GMT):<br/>
There is also the fabric CA which I assume only stores public keys 
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 13:54:42 GMT):<br/>
and there is also a memory key store
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 14:28:49 GMT):<br/>
@e-nikolov SDK supports three use cases: embedded credentials in client configuration, pre-enrolled users in the org's MSP directory, and dynamically enrolled users - when the cert is in the user store and the key in the crypto provider's key store. User identity is resolved by looking up the user enrollment cert first, and then looking up the matching private key. When resolving the cert, SDK first looks at the user store (@client.credentialStore.path); if cert is found, the key is looked up in the crypto provider key store (HSM or @client.credentialStore.cryptoStore.path). If the identity is not resolved, SDK looks up embedded certs in client configuration; if not found, it looks up the org's MSP directory (@organizations.<org>.cryptoPath). If not found, "user not found" is reported. Otherwise, the matching private key is first searched in embedded keys in client configuration, then in the crypto provider key store, and finally in the org's MSP directory.
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 14:42:49 GMT):<br/>
@aleksandar.likic 

Currently if neither the cryptopath nor an embedded user list is provided, an error is returned from the NewIdentityManager function (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/msp/identitymgr.go#L48)

</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 14:43:21 GMT):<br/>
how is the case of only having users stored in an HSM currently handled?
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 14:44:02 GMT):<br/>
should a cryptopath/embedded user still be specified?
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 19:54:35 GMT):<br/>
@e-nikolov Yes, this needs to be fixed. I created https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-9625 to try capture possible authentication scenarios, what configuration each should require, and whether or not they are currently supported. You are welcome to review the story and propose changes.

Regarding specifically the HSM use case, it is supported, but as you pointed out it might require you to configure the SDK with  unnecessary store(s) as the workaround.
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 20:25:35 GMT):<br/>

@aleksandar.likic I am working on a pull request for supporting Hashicorp's Vault as a user storage backend for the sdk and I'm trying to figure out how to best approach it
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 20:30:14 GMT):<br/>
Do you think it should be done as an implementation of the CryptoSuite or the KeyStore interface?
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 20:36:29 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=wRyT9yTyn57wshWkg) At the moment we have properly tested only register and enroll. I created https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-9626 for implementing missing CA functions (this has been outstanding for some time).
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 20:52:09 GMT):<br/>
@e-nikolov SDK uses BCCSP behind CryptoSuite interface. The problem with BCCSP's KeyStore interface is that it accepts the Key interface, which is opaque. BCCSP's SW file key store implementation serializes private keys (before persisting them) using functions that are not exported, so it's currently impossible to implement a custom KeyStore unless you want to keep the keys only in memory.
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 20:54:25 GMT):<br/>
then a custom BCCSP implementation would be the way to go?
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 20:56:05 GMT):<br/>
I think so. Maybe you can ping authors of https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-8930 for tips.
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 20:56:43 GMT):<br/>
... if this makes sense to you, not sure
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 20:57:34 GMT):<br/>
There is also https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-9499?jql=text%20~%20BCCSP%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC in the same context
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 21:08:05 GMT):<br/>
I think changing SW implementation to better support pluggable key store is the shortest path. I created https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-9627 for this. The change should be easy (export some already existing functions), but it needs to be approved by Fabric maintainers.
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 21:11:29 GMT):<br/>
I think in the case of vault it can also be made to sign a payload with a private key stored in it
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 21:11:37 GMT):<br/>
so that the private keys never leave vault 
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 21:12:03 GMT):<br/>
so it's more of a remote alternative of an HSM
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 21:12:18 GMT):<br/>
I think it also supports an HSM as a backend 
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 21:12:36 GMT):<br/>
but it also can be used as a generic key/value store for secrets
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 21:13:13 GMT):<br/>
PKCS11 implementation uses HSM as the key store.
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 21:13:36 GMT):<br/>
yes, but it requires a local C library
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 21:13:47 GMT):<br/>
as an .so file
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 21:14:33 GMT):<br/>
and where I work, we are trying to keep a more centralized secrets service
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 21:15:45 GMT):<br/>
So it looks like you need to create a Vault implementation of BCCSP
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 21:16:23 GMT):<br/>
I think so too
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 23:57:33 GMT):<br/>
@aleksandar.likic @e-nikolov I probably missed something in your convo, but we don’t need to modify fabric to add vault to the SDK
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 23:58:02 GMT):<br/>
Just meet the cryptosuite interface of the SDK
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 23:58:46 GMT):<br/>
Similar to what the wrapper of BCCSP is doing in the SDK

Hi everyone, I used Fabric Go SDK to Put and Get from State DB, does anyone know how to get details of a transaction from transaction id? 
P.s: I call PutState with my own key, not using stub.GetTxID

Hey folks, any idea
```
[fabsdk/fab] 2018/04/23 11:03:21 UTC - tls.GetClientTLSConfig -> DEBU Client TLS certificate and/or key file not provided

 failed to create CA Client: error initializing CA [ca.org1.example.com]: init failed: Failed to get client TLS config: Failed to read '': open : no such file or directory

```


</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 23 Apr 2018 11:59:14 GMT):<br/>
Found a problem, I define `https` by mistake for `certificateAuthorities` url
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 23 Apr 2018 11:59:29 GMT):<br/>
I switch to `http` all works now
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 23 Apr 2018 12:54:47 GMT):<br/>
I have one more question :) I just learn how to create a new user, what I am missing is how to fetch that user now by passing and `name` and put it in the context so I can sign transactions or call chaincode with his identity/keys 
Do I need `GetSigningIdentity` or `WithUser` or what ? :) I know that everything is on godoc and fabric-sdk-go examples folder but its totally unclear I just need a help with logic/procedures. Thanks ;)
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Mon, 23 Apr 2018 13:56:56 GMT):<br/>
@nmarcetic You can use any of https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pkg/fabsdk#ContextOption. For example, see https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/dd0297151bf3bf9203423e8d3800375568b76458/test/integration/e2e/end_to_end.go#L59 for example. If you omit WithOrg(), the org will is taken from SDK configuration.
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 23 Apr 2018 14:18:48 GMT):<br/>
Ah got it, so `fabsdk.WithUser` is a magic ;) Thanks a lot @aleksandar.likic and the sdk context with stay with user I set until I change it (e.g set another user using `fabsdk.WithUser`) right ?
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Mon, 23 Apr 2018 14:18:53 GMT):<br/>
@titoe218 You should use https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pkg/client/ledger#Client.QueryTransaction, See example at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/dd0297151bf3bf9203423e8d3800375568b76458/test/integration/orgs/multiple_orgs_test.go#L212. The call in the example queries two peers and makes sure that both return the same payload.
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Mon, 23 Apr 2018 14:19:43 GMT):<br/>
@nmarcetic You cannot change user in context. To use another user, create a new context.
</p>

@bstasyszyn FYI https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/20563/ has just been merged so to test fabric's service discovery there is no need for hacks anymore
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 23 Apr 2018 21:21:42 GMT):<br/>
I mean:
```
// HandleChaincodeDeploy is expected to be invoked when a chaincode is deployed via a deploy transaction
func (sub *Subscription) HandleChaincodeDeploy(chaincodeDefinition *cceventmgmt.ChaincodeDefinition, dbArtifactsTar []byte) error {
	go func() {

	return nil
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 23 Apr 2018 21:21:47 GMT):<br/>
this isn't needed anymore
</p>
<p><strong>Norberthu</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 01:21:47 GMT):<br/>
@jriachi  Because you have instantiated the chaincode. In this situation, you should get NewClient instance, for example:
</p>
<p><strong>Norberthu</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 01:22:57 GMT):<br/>
`
func  SetClient() error {

	// Initialize the SDK with the configuration file
	sdk, err := fabsdk.New(config.FromFile(setup.ConfigFile))
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to create sdk: %v", err)
	}
	
	// Channel client is used to query and execute transactions
	client, err = sdk.NewClient(fabsdk.WithUser(setup.UserName)).Channel(setup.ChannelID)
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("failed to create new channel client: %v", err)
	}

	return nil
}`
</p>
<p><strong>Norberthu</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 01:23:40 GMT):<br/>
when you get client object, then you can start transaction .

@nmarcetic you need to enable grpc debug logging to see what exactly is going on. Last time I had this issue it was a bad host override, so the peer was rejecting TLS connection.

Hi, I have a problem with entityMatcher. I can't avoid inserting an entry in my `/etc/hosts` file for the CA. If anyone has any idea why?
Here is the configuration I use:
```
[...]

entityMatchers:
[...]
  certificateAuthorities:
    - pattern: (\w*)ca.org1.hf.chainhero.io(\w*)
      urlSubstitutionExp: https://localhost:7054

Now when I change some code logic in my rest server or sometime in chaincode, I must remove all docker containers I have installed and initialize network from beginning. Can I do that no need to remove all docker container and initialized again? When I did not remove docker container, fabric through errors like this:```

@Norberthu That did it. I was deleting the chaincode images from docker during the cleanup process. By leaving them untouched I was able to restart the system as per your recommendation. Thanks.

<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 08:55:51 GMT):<br/>
@titoe218 Good question I would also like to know this. For chaincode I am sure that you must re-deploy e.g kill dockers and start over or deploy a new version of the contract. Its immutable that's the way how all BC contracts/chaincode works, on Ethereum you must re-deploy cotract and do migration.
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 08:57:38 GMT):<br/>
for your rest server, you don't need to reset the network when you change the code I am sure :) Its just a client for Fabric, nothing related to the network
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 08:58:32 GMT):<br/>
From you error `Unable to install and instantiate the chaincode:`  ` Description: chaincode exists mycc` I think you are trying to install and instantiate chaincode again and again and this is a action that you should do it only once, not every time
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 08:59:22 GMT):<br/>
Only when you are deploying your chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 08:59:30 GMT):<br/>
or the new version of you chaincode

@titoe218 @nmarcetic "chaincode exists" is pretty clear, *the same version* of the chaincode has been installed/instantiated already. If you are making changes to already installed and instantiated chaincode (say version v0), you have two options:
1) install the new version of chaincode (specify the next version) and upgrade the chaincode to the new version.
2) delete the chaincode images so you can start installing/upgrading from v0 again:
$ docker images | grep <chaincode>
$ docker rmi <chaincode image IDs>

Hi, just wondering, is there a way that I can use the sdk to join a bunch of peers to different channels and also isolate the chaincode operations on those channels? I can join and install via ```target``` field. But Instantiate for example triggers the SDK to connect the eventbus to all peers in my config and waiting for the tx_event. Since that just one peer is connected to the channel I get the ```instantiateOrUpgradeCC timed out or cancelled``` error back.

<p><strong>govinda-attal</strong> (Sat, 28 Apr 2018 02:02:50 GMT):<br/>
Hello Guys, For Client applications using fabric-sdk-go  we use config.yaml and we specify urls or peer and orderer(s) to connect to
Something similar to https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/config/config_test.yaml.

Please note I want to specify some externally accessible IP address for orderer or maybe a DNS record later that makes more sense which could be some sort of alias to what we specify on configtx.yaml.

----- config.yaml ----
orderers:
  orderer.example.com:
    url: grpc://XX.XX.XX.XX:7050
----- config.yaml ----

I thought this configuration should be enough for it to connect to Hyperledger Orderer to submit transactions. But when experimenting around, I found that it the client application somehow finds out that it tries to dial orderer url what we specify as one of the orderer 'Addresses' in 'configtx.yaml' used during fabric network setup. I am not sure how did it find out? Nothing like that is directly specified in config.yaml for client application. Also, I think this address is more like an internal address that was when we stood up the fabric network. I could be wrong and happy to be corrected.

----- configtx.yaml -----
Orderer: &OrdererDefaults

    # Orderer Type: The orderer implementation to start
    # Available types are "solo" and "kafka"
    OrdererType: solo

    Addresses:
        - orderer.example.com:7050
----- configtx.yaml -----

I was able to verify with break-points that fabric-sdk-go in its orderer.go somehow knows that orderer url is orderer.example.com, but not what I directly specified in config.yaml XX.XX.XX.XX:7050

I found this a bit hard to understand. Could you please help.

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 28 Apr 2018 02:30:21 GMT):<br/>
@govinda-attal yes - the Go SDK uses the configuration in the config block to determine the orderer. It's an outstanding issue to resolve this confusion with the config file.

@govinda-attal yes - the Go SDK uses the configuration in the config block to determine the orderer. It's an outstanding issue to resolve this orderer confusion with the config file.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 28 Apr 2018 02:30:44 GMT):<br/>
the good news is that you can map URLs with the SDK config
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 28 Apr 2018 02:30:55 GMT):<br/>
the entity mappers section does this
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 28 Apr 2018 02:31:19 GMT):<br/>
so you can map whatever you have in the config block to an externally accessible URL
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 28 Apr 2018 02:32:12 GMT):<br/>
example of a URL mapper for orderer is here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/config/overrides/local_entity_matchers.yaml#L49

Hello,

I try with [fabcar](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/write_first_app.html) example using go-sdk, and when I use [Execute](https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pkg/client/channel#Client.Execute) function to create a request (proposal) and send it,
I get this error:
‘calling orderer 'orderer.example.com:7050' failed: Orderer Client Status Code: (2) CONNECTION_FAILED. Description: dialing connection timed out [orderer.example.com:7050]’

go code:

```ctxCh := sdk.ChannelContext("mychannel", fabsdk.WithUser("user1"))
chClient, err := channel.New(ctxCh)
if err != nil {
log.Fatalln("error from New channel", err)
}

req := channel.Request{

   Fcn:         "createCar",
   Args:        [][]byte{[]byte("CAR10"), []byte("Honda"), []byte("Accord"), []byte("Black"), []byte("Tom")},
}
resp, err := chClient.Execute(req)
if err != nil {
   log.Fatalln("error from Execute =", err)
}```


my config.yaml
```channels:
  # name of the channel
  mychannel:
    orderers:

orderers:
  orderer.example.com:

as far as I understand it, at the moment a user's private key is identified in the CryptoSuite via the SKI of its public key (the GetKey(ski []byte) (k Key, err error) function), but in Vault each key has a path by which it is identified and that path is different to the SKI. Would it be acceptable to make the SKI() function for vault keys return the vault path for the vault implementation, or should I do a separate mapping?

<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 15:16:00 GMT):<br/>
@nmarcetic It looks like the peer is unable to verify the signature on a request made by the SDK. You should check your MSP ID to make sure it matches what you have in the channel configuration:
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/config/config_test.yaml#L207
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 15:17:12 GMT):<br/>
@divyank Thank you for you help. I have ` mspid: org1` but dunno what's the valid `mspid` for https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release-1.1/chaincode-docker-devmode and how to check, any idea ?
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 15:19:26 GMT):<br/>
I am not even 100% sure that I can use https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release-1.1/chaincode-docker-devmode with sdk, don't see any config for this dev mode
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 15:32:54 GMT):<br/>
Each peer has a local MSP ID: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.1/sampleconfig/core.yaml#L328
And each channel has a list of MSPs that are part of the channel https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.1/sampleconfig/configtx.yaml#L237
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 15:34:30 GMT):<br/>
I don't see any reason for not being able to use the chaincode dev mode with the SDK. It just means that the user starts the chaincode docker container and not the peer, installing and instantiating like you normally would.
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 15:35:24 GMT):<br/>
From your error message it looks like the MSP ID on your request is being set to `org1.example.com`, which the peer does not recognize. 
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 15:36:36 GMT):<br/>
It should be set to one of the MSPs on the channel that you are transacting on.

@troyronda I pushed a WIP version of the vault CryptoSuite at https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/21287/ Can you guys give me some preliminary feedback on my general approach? 
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:58:47 GMT):<br/>
also vault's sdk requires go 1.10, while the fabric sdk claims it supports go 1.9
</p>
<p><strong>e-nikolov</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 09:58:55 GMT):<br/>
would that be an issue?
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 10:27:44 GMT):<br/>
@titoe218 looks like a problem with fabric grpc protos. SDK copies all fabric dependencies (including protos) under https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/tree/master/third_party/github.com/hyperledger/fabric and imports from there. This is done so the client doesn't need to depend on fabric directly (all you vendor is the SDK). Do you import any fabric protos directly? Can you make sure that you import protos from SDK, like in https://github.com/securekey/fabric-examples/blob/master/fabric-cli/cmd/fabric-cli/printer/blockprinter.go ?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 18:40:53 GMT):<br/>
@aleksandar.likic @e-nikolov we should probably update the README to Go 1.10. The CI is only testing 1.10 right now.

Hi everyone, could anyone help with the following.
I have a two orgs, two peers each and peer0's of both orgs being endorsers. I have taken the `multiple_orgs_test.go` as starting point. I see the following errors when firing up the network:

a) In the terminal after some warning messages that getting orderers from endpoint is depreciated
```
sending deploy transaction proposal failed: Transaction processing for endorser [peer0.UMCorganisation.umc.com:7051]: Chaincode status Code: (500) UNKNOWN. Description: chaincode exists umcCC
```
From the docker logs of peer0:
```
[endorser] ProcessProposal -> ERRO 03d simulateProposal() resulted in chaincode response status 500 for txid: 362ad1b4735bdeed6984f427e084806d333f1880cb476c025a1698812d597137
```

Also, sometimes(!) the channel won't be created giving the error:
```
get channel config failed: could not get chConfig cache reference: QueryBlockConfig failed: queryChaincode failed: Transaction processing for endorser [peer0.UMCorganisation.umc.com:7051]: Endorser Client Status Code: (2) CONNECTION_FAILED. Description: dialing connection timed out [peer0.UMCorganisation.umc.com:7051]

@nmarcetic `Failed to deserialize creator identity, err MSP` seems like you have set the mspid to `MSP`
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 09:51:07 GMT):<br/>
@Kyroy Yea but `err MSP org1.example.com is unknown` sounds like `org1.example.com` is mspid right ?
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 09:51:53 GMT):<br/>
I don't understand how to register mspid at all ? What's the mspid ? I see in config.yaml organization mspid but what to put there :) ?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 09:52:32 GMT):<br/>
Which network do you use?
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 09:53:29 GMT):<br/>
what  do you mean by network ? 
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 09:55:17 GMT):<br/>
You connect your sdk to a peer (`localhost:7051`). I guess you use docker-compose to start it? Take a look at the docker-compose.yaml and search for something like `CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org1MSP`
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 10:02:18 GMT):<br/>
@Kyroy exactly I am using docker-compose , I see CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID on both peer and orderer  it should be the same value as in config.yaml mspid right ?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 10:03:46 GMT):<br/>
I think in the orderer it should be `ORDERER_GENERAL_LOCALMSPID`. But you (for now) can ignore this value. The peer mspid is the interesting one. Use this in your config.yaml for the sdk ;)
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 10:04:55 GMT):<br/>
Yea but what to put for mspid in config.yaml which value ? :) 
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 10:05:16 GMT):<br/>
What ever I want , e.g how to know/check my mspid :)
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 10:06:48 GMT):<br/>
check https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/config/config_test.yaml#L25
and https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/config/config_test.yaml#L206-L214
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 10:10:46 GMT):<br/>
OK I see so mspid is some random string actually ? I can put what ever I want like they did https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/config/config_test.yaml#L208
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 10:11:35 GMT):<br/>
No it is not random. It is based on the configuration of the peer and your crypto material
</p>
<p><strong>titoe218</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 10:15:14 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 10:16:53 GMT):<br/>
@Kyroy I see but how they get `mspid: Org1MSP` ? They have Organizagtion Org1 and Org2 and mspid's Org1MSP and Org2MSP so its this a naming rule ? Organization name + MSP = Org1MSP ?
</p>

Are you calling `logging.SetLevel("fabsdk/fab", logging.WARNING)`,  after 'sdk.New()' ?
If you do it before, then log levels from your config will override earlier log levels set by you.

@aleksandar.likic I've just discovered a nil pointer panic in the new MSP client: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-10016
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 11 May 2018 16:50:12 GMT):<br/>
@ga25waq it is normal to return a nil msp if it's not found, it's up the application to check if it's nil before using it.

</p>
<p><strong>ga25waq</strong> (Fri, 11 May 2018 16:51:18 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk But in that case I would except an error.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 11 May 2018 16:52:23 GMT):<br/>
that's debatable if an error must be returned for an msp not found
</p>
<p><strong>ga25waq</strong> (Fri, 11 May 2018 16:57:08 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk By the way, I've inspected the MSP client's New method. Nil for the client instance is only returned together with an error. So I guess the nil pointer panic is provoked in the GetSigningIdentity method itself.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 11 May 2018 16:58:33 GMT):<br/>
ok, in this case, it's a valid bug.. GetSigningIdentity should't panic

(regardless of whether or not there are underlying issues).
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 11 May 2018 17:09:14 GMT):<br/>
then an error should be returned (MSP not found)

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 11 May 2018 18:28:08 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk @aleksandar.likic @bstasyszyn So from the review comments, there is a concern that having both a boolean and err return value adds complexity.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 11 May 2018 18:32:14 GMT):<br/>
a few thoughts:
* nil shouldn't be returned when err is nil. the value should be safe to use. (same comment as above).
* it shouldn't be two steps to check for NotFound. (i.e., shouldn't have to do a cast AND then check a status code).
* we could do just a cast to package.NotFound and check for only OK; we could do a comparison to an err value like package.ErrNotFound; or have a(n extra) NotFound boolean return.
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 11 May 2018 18:50:09 GMT):<br/>
I prefer ErrNotFound over having an extra boolean return.

<p><strong>david_dornseifer</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 09:38:19 GMT):<br/>
Hi, I'm experiencing the issue that my program where I'm using the SDK is accumulating a big amount of open connections (```lsof -p```) when I address single peers via the target field. E.g. I have two peers in the config but I'm just joining a single peer to a channel and install and instantiate different chaincodes on each individual peer. After running some tests I end up with several thousand open files / connections and the program breaks. 
</p>
<p><strong>david_dornseifer</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 09:39:14 GMT):<br/>
If I just execute all channel and chaincode operations on all peers the open connections are stable
</p>
<p><strong>david_dornseifer</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 09:39:23 GMT):<br/>
any idea what I'm doing wrong? 
</p>
<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 12:44:17 GMT):<br/>
Hi @troyronda, is there a quick and dirty way to test whether a chaincode has already been installed on a channel? Currently I face is a `panic` when starting up the network for a second time after CC was successfully invoked earlier — in previous sdk versions there used to be only a warning message after which I could continue with the app and start the client and add data to CouchDB, i.e. my stateDatabase. 

I have been looking at the method
`func (rc *Client) isChaincodeInstalled(reqCtx reqContext.Context, req InstallCCRequest, peer fabApi.ProposalProcessor, retryOpts retry.Opts) (bool, error)` in the `resmgmt` package but that looks a bit like killing a mosquito with a gun. 

Otherwise, can’t we just let the application continue and skip the installing/initialization of the chaincode if ChainCodeID and Version are the same, and only call `UpgradeCC` if name and/or version are not the same? Please advise. Thanks.

@angeloatleadiq @MeghaGupta Is it possible that you guys import fabric github.com/hyperledger/fabric packages in your application code? Go SDK doesn't import them directly, it rather copies them under fabric-sdk-go/internal/github.com/hyperledger/fabric and uses them from there. This way the client application doesn't need to vendor fabric (and its dependencies). But it has use any fabric packages required when using the SDK (e.g. protos) from fabric-sdk-go/internal/github.com/hyperledger/fabric, otherwise you'll have errors due to structs coming from different packages.
</p>
<p><strong>MeghaGupta</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 15:12:17 GMT):<br/>
Hi, I have imported import (

@MeghaGupta It is OK to do it in chaincode. I didn't pay attention, it looks like your question is not SDK related, so you'll be better served in another chat channel. Most likely you just need to follow the documentation more carefully.

Hello! I am trying to write some tests for a project that uses the fabric-sdk-go. I use the fabsdk.FabricSDK to obtain the channelClient. Once I have the channelClient I want to mock out the responses for Query and Invoke. Is there test code I could look at to achieve that? I am using v1.0.0-alpha3

<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 15:41:32 GMT):<br/>
@elicrisko to remove all docker images you need to call this: `docker rmi -f $(docker images -aq)`
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 15:42:08 GMT):<br/>
make sure to delete the containers first : `docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)`
</p>
<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 15:45:35 GMT):<br/>
@elicrisko if you run on a Mac you have Kitematics at your disposal. By firing this up you can see if there are still docker containers floating around and remove them manually.

Just to make sure, are you using the right tags for the images?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 15:52:29 GMT):<br/>
When I use `client.Execute(channel.Request{…}, channel.WithTargetEndpoints(peerURL))` https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/chclient.go#L111 at some point queryPeers https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/fab/chconfig/chconfig.go#L149 is executed. This calls `c.calculateTargetsFromConfig` which selects all peers that are configured in the config. Afterwards, only 2 of these peers get randomly selected by `randomMaxTargets`.

As a user, I would expect all following requests of `client.Execute` to target my `peerURL` specified in the options.

Is there a way to enforce this? When submitting a PR, where would you add this option? I would be happy to help. ( @troyronda )
</p>
<p><strong>elicrisko</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 15:53:47 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=c4QQvfg8fCrnRy2gM) @habpygo Yes, I do have Kitematic (Beta)
</p>
<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 16:02:07 GMT):<br/>
If you open it it will show all docker containers which are running or stopped. The ones stopped or down are greyed out. If you find any of these remove them by clicking on the cross on the right side when you hover over them. Then, if you are sure there are no more containers around, delete the left over images and then start again. 
</p>
<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 16:08:09 GMT):<br/>
By the way, Kitematic is still Beta and you have to give  a `cmd-r` to refresh the UI, because sometimes the containers don't show up.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 16:28:10 GMT):<br/>
@Kyroy I don't think `channel.WithTargetEndpoints(peerURL)` is meant to enforce that such target... in any case, the discovery service underneath the SDK will propagate the `client.Execute` invocation to all the network's peers
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 17:56:44 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk `// WithTargetEndpoints allows overriding of the target peers for the request.`

@Kyroy the calls to fetch channel config is unrelated to the chaincode invocation.

@troyronda The use-case is: managing a lot of channels dynamically. So I created 1 `channels` entry with all my peers. But sometimes, a channel is only joined by 1 peer and I do NOT want to update my config all the time and persist a state in my config.yaml file.

But, when now invoking a chaincode, where I know it is in channelX in peerY, I want only to query peerY and not 2 RANDOM peers (most likely peerY is not one of them).

So if you do not supply WithTargetEndpoints, the SDK uses a combination of the discovery service and selection service to determine which endorsers to use.

But it still calls all peers from my channel config?

<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:31:11 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=HBmMN7yeucsrcwegc) That was exactly my use-case I wrote :O
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:31:27 GMT):<br/>
It will only call the peers that you supply in WithTargetEndpoints for the chaincode invocation.
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:31:30 GMT):<br/>
I know all the peers when I am executing `Execute`
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:32:07 GMT):<br/>
(I purposely say chaincode invocation as there is a background activity that is refreshing the channel config).
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:32:18 GMT):<br/>
and that background activity is what you saw in the logs.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:34:07 GMT):<br/>
well, I'm guessing you should check if the WithTargetEndpoints is working for you or if there is a problem
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:35:02 GMT):<br/>
Just to clarify:
When I am using WithTargetEndpoints with only one peer, none of the other peers should get called, right?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:35:43 GMT):<br/>
correct ... for chaincode invocation. the background activity will still call peers for channel config.
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:36:10 GMT):<br/>
But the background activity is erroring my request

<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:40:38 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda for this use-case (when channels are load-balanced to different peers), do you think the sdk would be more efficient when not providing the targets and select them automatically? :O
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:49:14 GMT):<br/>
@Kyroy the selection of peers for fetching channel config comes from the channel peers subsection of the config
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:49:48 GMT):<br/>
you should only have peers that are callable from that client in that subsection
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:50:35 GMT):<br/>
specifically this code is handling the retrieval of peers for this purpose: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/81cbc396a6d006ee1476620fa6522f3290270bbc/pkg/fab/chconfig/chconfig.go#L197
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:51:29 GMT):<br/>
I know =) But I have to handle a lot of channels and don't want to update my config.yaml when a new channel is created. So I added only 1 channel in the config, where all peers are included and map all channels to it.

 [ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=kymv6Rjq2yETpruTQ) 
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:51:39 GMT):<br/>
I believe the WithTargetEndpoints allows you to specify peers that are not in the channel peers subsection.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:52:33 GMT):<br/>
So, as usual, we allowed the ability to override logic ... ;)

@Kyroy it requires Fabric 1.2

and you need to create a factory that returns a dynamic discovery instance..

<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 15:32:28 GMT):<br/>
is there a way to test the sdk api calls without standing up fabric network?  

i m looking for some kind of mock package of the api but it looks like currently the sdk returns the objects instead of the interfaces representing the objects; eg in fabsdk,  `func New(cp core.ConfigProvider, opts ...Option) (*FabricSDK, error)` which doesn't facilitate implementing mocks for unit testing
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 15:42:17 GMT):<br/>
if the answer is no, my thought is this:  we refactor the api and define interfaces for the current objects that we return, then we can create a mocks package implementing the interfaces to allow app unit test to use mocks in testing the app code. 
Thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 16:30:34 GMT):<br/>
works I think...we could start with the minimal interfaces we use and keep adding as we go

<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 19:12:33 GMT):<br/>
@binhn @muralisr Under the hood, the FabricSDK object is just a container for SDK Services. If you don't provide your implementation of services (SDK options - https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pkg/fabsdk#Option), default implementations are initialized by FabricSDK. So one can provide implementation of SDK services (SDK service providers) that mocks the network.
SDK service providers are interfaces defined at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/fabsdk/api/factory.go . SDK Services are not used directly; to simplify the SDK usage, high-level clients are exposed as described at https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go. Hope this helps.

One way to mock SDK services is to use https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pkg/fabsdk/test/mocksdkapi, which is generated from the services interfaces using GoMock.

<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 19:52:45 GMT):<br/>
@binhn I think the cleanest way to quickly mock, for example, executing a transaction using the SDK, would be to create an interface that would be implemented by the channel client (https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pkg/client/channel#Client). Then you provide mock implementation of the functions you need. Perhaps we could add to the SDK interfaces for high-level clients, to allow for easier API mocking.

Hey, we are experiencing `gRPC Transport Status Code: (14) Unavailable. Description: transport is closing` when querying and also when reading a block from a channel with the sdk:

error message:
```QueryBlock failed: Transaction processing for endorser [peer0......:7051]: gRPC Transport Status Code: (14) Unavailable. Description: transport is closing```

The payload size is ~370kb, so it is not too large.

We think this might be an issue with the connection handling of the sdk.
Also very weird: It is working reliable with smaller payloads ~25kb.

But restarting and getting a “small” (25kb) block always works!

Hey, we are experiencing `gRPC Transport Status Code: (14) Unavailable. Description: transport is closing` when querying and also when reading a block from a channel with the sdk:

error message:
```QueryBlock failed: Transaction processing for endorser [peer0......:7051]: gRPC Transport Status Code: (14) Unavailable. Description: transport is closing
```

The payload size is ~370kb, so it is not too large.

Sometimes the query works, and then works a lot of times in a row. *When waiting ~40s (>30s)*, it stops working and in the peer DEBUG log, we can see
```[grpc] Printf -> DEBU 5a8 transport: http2Server.HandleStreams failed to read frame: read tcp 172.17.0.4:7051->XX.XX.XX.XX:40792: use of closed network connection
```

We think this might be an issue with the connection handling of the sdk.
Also very weird: It is working reliable with smaller payloads ~25kb.

```client:
  global:
    cache:
      channelMembership: 30s
   connectionIdle: 30s
```

@kelvinzhong This is true for org admin operations, like installing chaincodes. One cannot install a chaincode to another organization's peer. One can, however, ask any peer on the channel for endorsement.
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 11:37:58 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=Qa8mjXGfAnwrPxvij) @aleksandar.likic is that means a client can send the transaction to any peer from the other MSP? but I can't even call client.queryChannels(peer) if the peer is in different MSP, so how can i know if the peer is in the same channel?
</p>
<p><strong>kelvinzhong</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 11:38:59 GMT):<br/>
do we have any example that runs between different MSP within a channel?
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 12:03:51 GMT):<br/>
@kelvinzhong https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/orgs/multiple_orgs_test.go#L475 . This example uses dynamic endorser selection, which is based on the CC endorsement policy. I guess this is what you are looking for?

More info about my previous problem (`gRPC Transport Status Code: (14) Unavailable. Description: transport is closing`):
This also happens with get installed chaincodes (with a lot of chaincodes). So basically with all grpc connections to the peer if the payload gets larger (some kb :/)

@Kyroy the connection manager closes connection upon connection idle or upon call to sdk.Close. There were some bug fixes in the connection manager in the last couple weeks as well.

<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 15:11:09 GMT):<br/>
Hi @Kyroy , i'm trying to reproduce this issue. What do you mean by "restarting the sdk"?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 15:16:42 GMT):<br/>
@divyank When I restart my go application (REST service) and start making calls again

Thank you for trying to help :)
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 15:24:42 GMT):<br/>
@Kyroy Does the issue only appear after restart? Is the SDK reinitialized upon restart (i.e. sdk.Close() and sdk.New())?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 15:31:38 GMT):<br/>
@divyank no, it does not only appear after restart. The app runs in a docker container and comes up with the container. Then the `sdk.New()` is executed.
With the restart, I wanted to say that the error also occurs after a fresh sdk.New call. Not only when the sdk had connections to the peer and closed them ... and so on
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 15:43:52 GMT):<br/>
@Kyroy @divyank do the peer logs show anything?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 15:44:43 GMT):<br/>
The show that everything runs fine and then:
```[grpc] Printf -> DEBU 5a8 transport: http2Server.HandleStreams failed to read frame: read tcp 172.17.0.4:7051->XX.XX.XX.XX:40792: use of closed network connection
```
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 15:45:04 GMT):<br/>
(could "transport is closing" due to the peer closing the connection?)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 15:45:04 GMT):<br/>
(could "transport is closing" be due to the peer closing the connection?)
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 15:45:07 GMT):<br/>
where XX.XX.XX.XX is the ip where the sdk is running
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 15:46:18 GMT):<br/>
I don't know for sure if the peer is closing the connection. But at least it does not log this and there is no reason to do so :D
The request also does not take long :thinking: 
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 18:53:30 GMT):<br/>
@Kyroy I ran some tests locally with 10MB payloads with success. I assume you're using a networked environment? Could there be some infrastructure on your network that closes long lived connections?
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 18:54:09 GMT):<br/>
If you can create a Jira issue with complete debug logs from the peers and client I can take a deeper look.
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 21:00:29 GMT):<br/>
@divyank I was also able to get over 50mb locally.

Yes. It is a networked environment on AWS. But everything within one region. Okay. I will do this tomorrow. Thanks for your help :)

Go SDK folks - FYI, there is a now utility in fabric core that allows you to generate a self signed TLS certificate. 
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/common/crypto/tlsgen
Useful for forcing the SDK to use mutual TLS even when the client didn't supply a certificate, as the fabric peer requests (but doesn't verify) the client cert by default.
Usage is pretty simple:
```
ca, err := NewCA()
kp, err := ca.NewClientCertKeyPair()
```

@kelvinzhong Oh, I thought you were using Go SDK, since you posted to this channel :wink: Take a look at https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/membership/membership.html#local-and-channel-msps . Peers authenticate clients (who submit tx proposals on the channel) based on the channel MSP which is shared among peers and orderers that participate on the channel. As long as a client belongs to an org on the channel, it should be able to transact with any peer on the channel. If you can't do it, it's probably a misconfiguration.

<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Wed, 30 May 2018 15:11:05 GMT):<br/>
@huxinxin CCEvent is a part of the committed block. So the transaction was validated. By listening for a CCEvent you are listening for a committed transaction. Any number of clients can listen for a CCEvent. Only the client that has committed a transaction to an orderer will be notified if the transaction failed.

@pankaj13 , NetworkConfig struct is indirectly available from sdk, you need to first get the configBackend like this (once the sdk is created):
configBackend, err := sdk.Config()
then, you can get an endpointConfig from this configBackend like this:
endpointConfig, err := fab.ConfigFromBackend(configBackend...)
finally, this endpointConfig has the NetworkConfig struct you are looking for:
endpointConfig, err := fab.ConfigFromBackend(configBackend...)

of course, make sure err is nil

@aleksandar.likic thanks for your reply.I still have a puzzle.I tried update the same key at the same time with Execute() in different peers. Only one succeed and the others get a MVCC_READ_CONFLICT error.Does it means that if there is no errors in Execute(), the transaction is validated.

what is static discovery and what is dynamic discovery, @bstasyszyn ? is static just like a connection profile equivalent? 
</p>
<p><strong>bstasyszyn</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 18:30:24 GMT):<br/>
Static discovery reads a config file where all peers are defined; dynamic uses the peer's discovery service
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 18:30:56 GMT):<br/>
how far are you with integrating with the peer's discovery service, by the way?

i mean, you as golang SDK

Hello,
I have some trouble setting correcly the endorsement policy of a chaincode via the Go SDK. I have a non-TLS fabric network with one org : org1-hfclarablock. 
To instantiate my chaincode I use 
```ccPolicy := cauthdsl.SignedByAnyMember([]string{"org1-hfclarablock"})
setup.admin.InstantiateCC(setup.ChannelID, resmgmt.InstantiateCCRequest{Name: setup.ChainCodeID, Path: setup.ChaincodePath, Version: "1.0", Args: [][]byte{[]byte("init")}, Policy: ccPolicy})
``` 

But then I got error in my peer logs looking like 
```2018-06-01 08:52:16.935 UTC [vscc] Invoke -> WARN e54 Endorsement policy failure for transaction txid=7899092b96d9dab4c86d5dead4d260fddf3d337fd423639f758a2417d9912012, err: signature set did not satisfy policy
2018-06-01 08:52:16.935 UTC [committer/txvalidator] validateTx -> ERRO e61 VSCCValidateTx for transaction txId = 7899092b96d9dab4c86d5dead4d260fddf3d337fd423639f758a2417d9912012 returned error: VSCC error: endorsement policy failure, err: signature set did not satisfy policy
``` 

Did someone faced the same issues ? Any help is welcome ;) 

Thanks !

I currently have a channel where (when querying the last block) `LastConfigFromBlock` points to block 1734, but actually, block 1735 is the CONFIG block.
Block 1734 is a ENDORSER_TRANSACTION

@dimaxgl the pace of changes to the main client interfaces (intended for usage by end developers) is much lower than in earlier tags. the upcoming tag had a few tweaks based on feedback/usage (compared to alpha3). The largest functional changes in alpha4 have been a refactoring of config to allow for progmatic/minimal configurations (rather than requiring a config file) and inclusion of Fabric 1.2's discovery service.

Hi @Kyroy, I ran some tests and the LastConfig.Index returned from resource.GetLastConfigFromBlock is accurate. What API are you using to query blocks?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 15:48:05 GMT):<br/>
@divyank So faw (couple of months) everything worked like a charm. Also now. Normally there is no problem.
But I have one channel, where this happens. Probably a fabric problem, right? :D
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 15:49:53 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 15:50:39 GMT):<br/>
It is unlikely. Maybe a bad assumption somewhere? Block numbers are always zero indexed (block 0 being the genesis block).
</p>
<p><strong>divyank</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 15:50:51 GMT):<br/>

If the last config index on block 1734 is 1734 and 1734 does not have any config transactions, that we be pretty conclusive evidence of a fabric bug. I would create a Jira ticket with the block dumps and contact fabric maintainers.

@RealDeanZhao if you want to use a different CA in your code, you need to create a new entry with its own MSP cert/keys, take at look at the this config: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/df181da0c806d03bd8b7fcde8dfa147472ff6a89/test/fixtures/config/config_test.yaml#L359

</p>

@troyronda Well, yes, I tried. I tried to get it to work .. somehow. But the fact that the sdk has copied the proto files (and not imported, dunno why?) I cannot work with it. Because they are too new. Not on fabric 1.1 anymore
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 15:18:43 GMT):<br/>
SDK doesn't want an import dependency back to Fabric was the reason :).
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 15:19:33 GMT):<br/>
e.g. I want to use `protolator.DeepUnmarshalJSON`

It is very hard/not possible to include fabric and fabric-sdk-go together. e.g. fabric@master and fabric-sdk-go@master require differen viper versions. so dep sais NO

<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 15:25:03 GMT):<br/>
But the sdk has other proto files that do not work with fabric1.1 proto files
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 15:25:03 GMT):<br/>
or do not work with the protolator

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 15:25:26 GMT):<br/>
the SDK protos are namespaced seperately from the fabric protos
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 15:26:03 GMT):<br/>
Currently, I am calling the configtxlator binary REST endpoint from my application and I would love to just include the protolator from fabric
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 15:26:07 GMT):<br/>
hmm :thinking: 
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 15:26:09 GMT):<br/>
so you should be able to import them into the same project.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 15:26:31 GMT):<br/>
as long as their usage is independent :)
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 15:27:03 GMT):<br/>
Importing worked, but I got some errors (see above) that I couldnt unmarshal etc. Thought it was because of the proto files.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 15:28:24 GMT):<br/>
are you trying to send an object from an SDK proto as the argument into what you imported from fabric?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 15:29:38 GMT):<br/>
No, I am e.g. trying to get the json from my genesis.block
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 15:29:57 GMT):<br/>
you fetched the genesis block using the SDK?

Was there a reason you suspect the SDK protos? e.g., you tried without importing the SDK?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 15:37:27 GMT):<br/>
(since these protos are namespaced separately, it wouldn't be my first suspicion)
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 15:38:14 GMT):<br/>
I also tried with the sdk objects. And previously (a long time ago) I think there was a problem with both proto files and you coudn't use it together
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 15:38:22 GMT):<br/>
did not know that they are now namespaced
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 15:39:37 GMT):<br/>
yeh we modify the proto registrations paths, to allow both protos to be imported

I am also not sure what
````msgType := proto.MessageType("common.Block")

is doing when I import both, fabric and the sdk :thinking: 
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 15:41:42 GMT):<br/>
when objects need to be shared between the protos, then additional files can be copied from fabric into the sdk.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 15:42:14 GMT):<br/>
e.g., that's why we copy https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/tree/master/third_party/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/common/cauthdsl

@Kyroy The SDK's version of the protos are distinct types from fabric's protos. I doubt protolator would work with type "fabric-sdk-go/third_party/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/common" as it expects type "fabric/protos/common".

<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 12:07:49 GMT):<br/>
I saw some workarounds from chaincode blog where they actually replace the fabric version to 1.0.5 but I want to use the latest v1.1.0  https://chainhero.io/2018/03/tutorial-build-blockchain-app-2/ Check the comments 
Does anybody had similar experience ? Thanks ;)
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 12:09:30 GMT):<br/>
This was recommendation from the blog ^ `Edit the “Gopkg.toml” and make it match with the new “Gopkg.toml” which is available in our repository : https://github.com/chainHero/heroes-service/blob/v1.0.5/Gopkg.toml` But revision `014d6befcf67f3787bb3d67ff34e1a98dc6aec5f` is Fabric 1.0.05 release 
</p>
<p><strong>nmarcetic</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 12:12:18 GMT):<br/>
@MaximeAubanel any idea ^ ? :)

@nmarcetic in Go SDK, simply run 'make populate-vendor' then 'dep ensure' .. no need to do 'dep init' as the toml files are checked in git already. Why do you need to build the sdk, may I ask?

@titoe218 take a look at your sdk config.yaml about the channels
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 09:34:55 GMT):<br/>
Still not fix the issue.  The peers are running in the docker containers and the SDK is sending the request from the host.  ```

<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 09:35:44 GMT):<br/>
Seems that the grpc server in the container not listening the request from the host

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=qejnz3FThafiXDSJp) @Baha-sk I am not building the SDK I want to `dep init` for my project App. I am using `fabric-sdk-go` and `fabric` in my App which is the purpose of SDK ofc and I want to do `dep init` and manage my project deps/vendor but I can't because of this error.

Sending the https request to the CA server in the container works fine

@RealDeanZhao I would guess you are using hostnames that are not known outside of docker?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 13:35:18 GMT):<br/>
If so, You can add them to your /etc/hosts file or use entity Matchers in the config.

I would think this is the default way, except for documentation-related examples.

@titoe218 this warning comes from specifying the orderer in the channel section of the config. The SDK discovers the channel orderer from the config block
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 13:43:05 GMT):<br/>
As the SDK is more focused on using dynamic network configuration and peer discovery, warnings have started to be added

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 13:44:11 GMT):<br/>
@nmarcetic the Go SDK is compatible with dep - we use both in our own projects
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 13:48:51 GMT):<br/>
it looks like there is a constraint conflict currently
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 13:56:14 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda I've edited the host file and peer1-xxxx is mapped to 127.0.0.1

<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 13:56:21 GMT):<br/>
but it still not works
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 16:14:31 GMT):<br/>
@nmarcetic i'll look at the cfssl constraint in Go SDK.

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 16:15:28 GMT):<br/>
@nmarcetic regarding fabric - i see you tried to use dep using Fabric 1.1, but I believe it is master/1.2 that added dep compatability.

Hi, does the SDK support CouchDB indexes introduced in HF v1.1? https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-3067
I tried to follow the example with the marbles (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/master/chaincode/marbles02/go), but it doesn't seem to work. In the NodeJS SDK there is a new attribute in the installation and instantiation request of the chaincode (https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/tutorial-metadata-chaincode.html), it is not present in the Go SDK. 
Anybody got any more information on this?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 11:24:21 GMT):<br/>
@antitoine the SDK simply includes the META-INF directory in your chaincode directory.
</p>

https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/commit/ae5783a16506388690cc9e7cbba9a215a1cb60a8#diff-88c719943afa288eeeab55012769c6a9
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 11:27:22 GMT):<br/>
I guess the node SDK handled it a bit differently by allowing to specify the meta directory separately 
</p>
<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 11:55:16 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda Thanks, I'm currently using an older version of the SDK, so that must be why I don't have the functionality. I'm going to update all this.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=t5Zt7vdJmKPhcNuwP) @RealDeanZhao does not *need* to be singleton but you will lose the benefits of caching (each SDK instance maintains various caches and those caches are flushed on close), so for common cases it *should* be.

Go SDK folks, in case you guys are using your CLI - I implemented a CLI tool for the discovery service that is pending to be merged (I hope someone will merge it before we cut GA :rolling_eyes: )
Documentation for the CLI - https://logs.hyperledger.org/production/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-3/fabric-docs-build-x86_64/421/html/discovery-cli.html
In case you want to incorporate the discovery CLI into your own CLI based on go-SDK, it can be done quite easily! The code is pretty modular... https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/22509/

@RealDeanZhao It doesn't look like a bug, in this case sdk will try to use entity matchers only if it is unable to find peer config by peer name.
in this case, `verifyPeerConfig` returns error if peer `p` found by lookup is [ empty || doesn't have valid URL || tls certificate doesn't exist]

I can see that https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/e2e/end_to_end.go#L167 does not do it. But I always get `Failed to get endorsing peers: N must be greater than 0` when I don't use `WithTargetEndpoints`.

You need enough peers to be discovered for that channel
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 11:44:51 GMT):<br/>
Prior to 1.2, discovery comes from config (unless override with a custom discovery). In 1.2, the SDK discovers peers automatically using the peer discovery service.

<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 12:07:46 GMT):<br/>
My peer is configured in the config.yaml file. I have no entityMatchers. And still the error. But when providing it in the targetEndpoints, it works (so the peer is in the config and can be accessed) @troyronda

@RealDeanZhao the enrollment process doesn't know if the user will be an admin. On the other hand, for a user to be an admin, he/she has to be enrolled - issued an x509 cert. The cert then has to be stored into a proper place. For a user to be able to create an application channel, its cert has to be stored as admin in the system channel's configuration. This is normally done when the genesis block of the system channel is created/modified. For a user to be able to perform operations on an application channel (not the system channel), like chaincode deployment, its cert has to be stored as admin in the application channel's configuration. This is normally done when the genesis block of the application channel is created/modified. For a user to be able to perform operations on a peer, like to join a peer to a channel, its cert has to be stored into the admin folder of the peer local MSP. I think this is roughly how this works, but don't hold me to it. To get the exact details see the Fabric Operations Guides at https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/ops_guide.html.

@ng2dev Is it possible that the SDK user doesn't have a permission to register a new user with "hf:Registrar.Roles":"validator"? That's what the error (Authorization failure) seems to indicate. Did you try some other attribute name/value?

Hi i have setup my chaincode endorsement policy such that 2 organization have to sign it out of 3..How can i pass the signs so that transaction is approved. I am using Oracle Blockchain Beta..and calling my arguments through rest API's..Can i pass some parameters which enable signing or is there some other method?

<p><strong>ng2dev</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 11:08:32 GMT):<br/>
@aleksandar.likic  pretty much tried any combination I could think of - like accountID, hf.accountID ... but ye this did not make sense as admin needs to have as you say permission to set certain attributes on users
</p>
<p><strong>ng2dev</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 11:12:44 GMT):<br/>
so hf.Registrar.Roles is I thought the most straight-forward as this standard admin user is able to register type validator (without attributes) but maybe I am mixing up type/role and attribute/role

But comparing that openssl output with the admin cert from the fabric-go-sdk test that cert does not have anything special encoded either (like a wildcard for attributes or such) nevertehless the enrollment_test.go can create attribute keys at random.

With the release of fabric 1.2 and the dynamic discovery service. Will it be possible to easily configure the sdk with only very few parameters?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 11:35:27 GMT):<br/>
@Kyroy the SDK configured itself based on the channel capabilities in the channel config block, by default
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 11:36:09 GMT):<br/>
So if you don’t have any overrides and you have the 1.2 capability in channel config then it is automatic :)
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 11:41:07 GMT):<br/>
But I need to provide some initial options for connecting to the peer/orderer, right? Do you have an example in the tests?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 11:41:55 GMT):<br/>
That's really cool :D Finally fabric gets dynamic

You need to have some peers configured so the SDK can fetch the channel config

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 11:42:12 GMT):<br/>
And the orderer endpoint
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 11:42:12 GMT):<br/>
And the SDK also fetched the orderer endpoint
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 11:42:12 GMT):<br/>
And the SDK also fetches the orderer endpoint from channel config block, by default
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 11:43:49 GMT):<br/>
We use entity matchers to set endpoint configuration from dynamically discovered endpoints.
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 11:52:29 GMT):<br/>
But initially, I don't have any channel, right? How are the orderers discovered?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 11:53:46 GMT):<br/>
So I still need to set the `tlsCACerts.path` for every org?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 11:56:27 GMT):<br/>
Because, when I have a CC that's endorsement policy is e.g. majority or 5 orgs, the sdk has to connect to 2 other orgs, right?
It would be nice if I don't have to manage configurations for all orgs. Especially not when the network changes frequently

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 11:58:26 GMT):<br/>
you need to have some peers “configured” for each channel name so the SDK can fetch the channel config (including orderer endpoint)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 22 Jun 2018 11:58:43 GMT):<br/>
I have configured in quotes because you don’t need to use a config file

Hi everyone, I created an example to demonstrate usage of fabric-sdk-go. It actually is [balance-transfer](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/release-1.1/balance-transfer) project but using fabric-sdk-go instead. Take a look at https://github.com/khanhnb/balance-transfer-go.

@Kyroy Actually, easier if you just did cfg, err := cs.ChannelConfig() - this will return a cached channel config and you can get orderers directly (without having to query)

@troyronda Hi, I have a fabric network (built by ansible agent) with kuberenets which has my own (Go) chaincode installed on it, I am able to do transaction via CLI (login to peers and run commands). However, I cannot figure how to make calls from outside the fabric into it. How should I proceed? Any documents or information will be great help.

Because the discovery service treats "empty policies" as invalid policies, by design. I'm not sure why you instantiated the chaincode with an empty policy, but even if the discovery service would have supported such policies then it would have returned a descriptor that is empty, because the minimal combinations to satisfy an empty policy is actually not to endorse at all, and the discovery service "answers" the SDK with the question "what is the minimal set of peers I need to ask endorsements from?"

I don't think a chaincode that checks that the status is OK has any value, @Kyroy .
If you want to see if a peer is online there are much better ways to do that - you can query for the list of peers on a single peer and it would return to you all the peers.

There are multiple packages where I have to add if the returned status of the cc is OK. I would have created a method in the status package. But this is a vendored package from fabric.

@yacovm I query with Org1MSP:
The behaviour is actually equal for Invoke and Query:
It sometimes works, sometimes not. It does not work when the sdk logged:

I logged the call of: `func (cr *channelResponse) Endorsers(invocationChain InvocationChain, ps PrioritySelector, ef ExclusionFilter) (Endorsers, error)`
And after every 6th call, the sdk ERR is logged (without any request)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 19:48:07 GMT):<br/>
if you get access denied then you have to have some logs in the peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 19:49:26 GMT):<br/>
that's really odd though, what you're describing....
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 19:50:07 GMT):<br/>
as for the "no combination can be satisfied" - you're saying that you sometimes get this, and sometimes not?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 19:51:02 GMT):<br/>
Yes. But maybe it has something to do with my sdk config
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 19:51:26 GMT):<br/>
Can you please try to use https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discovery-cli.html 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 19:51:34 GMT):<br/>
and tell me if it reproduces the problem?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 19:51:42 GMT):<br/>
it's a CLI tool for the discovery service
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 19:51:52 GMT):<br/>
don't worry, it's friendly to use, unlike the peer cli
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 19:52:44 GMT):<br/>
you need to use the `endorsers` command
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 19:59:13 GMT):<br/>
The problem was my config.yaml for the sdk -.-
`channels.my-channel.peers` contained 1 peer from the other org, because I was switching orgs all the time.

And the `access denied` error is actually caused by this peer in the config value `peers`.

Sorry :facepalm_tone2: 
Tomorrow, I will continue here and see if I can get it working :D
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 19:59:37 GMT):<br/>
no no 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 19:59:39 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 19:59:49 GMT):<br/>
Regarding the 2 JIRA issues. I created one for the Any endorsement policy and 1 for the fabric-sdk-go because e.g. status code 201 was returned as error. Something unrelated
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 19:59:56 GMT):<br/>
please properly explain what caused the access denied
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 20:00:29 GMT):<br/>
oh.... you had a peer certificate?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 20:00:37 GMT):<br/>
instead of a client certificate?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 20:07:11 GMT):<br/>
I have 2 Orgs.
Org1 has 3 peers. 2 of them configured in the config.yaml
Org2 has 1 peer. 1 configured in the config.yaml

-> this alone is okay

But I also configured Org1 and Org2 in the config.yaml and set `client.organization` to Org1
Which I thought is ok. But only when I also configure Org2, the access denied error is logged. (I think when the discovery service is querying)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 20:08:36 GMT):<br/>
what is `client.organizations` ? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 20:08:36 GMT):<br/>
what is `client.organization` ? 
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 20:11:45 GMT):<br/>
Going further:
When there are Org1 and Org2 configured. And additionally in `channels` I configure Org2's peer for the channel, I sometimes get the `no endorsement combination can be satisfied` when invoking/querying
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 20:13:22 GMT):<br/>
ok, lets continue this tomorrow
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 20:15:02 GMT):<br/>
I agree. Maybe also via PM. Not spamming this channel :D
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 20:18:17 GMT):<br/>
no, not via PM because I have no clue in go SDK... I just want to know that there is no bug in the peer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 20:18:17 GMT):<br/>

@Kyroy `clientChannelContext := ChannelContext(channelID string, options ...ContextOption)` returns without error, but then `channel.New(clientChannelContext)`  fails with the same error, i.e.

@yacovm Workflow:
1. Create channel at org1
2. join org1peer0
3. create channel update to join org2
4. update channel 
5. install CC at org1peer0
6. invoke/query works at org1peer0
7. join org2peer0 to channel
```peer0.org2.example.com       | 2018-06-28 06:29:11.973 UTC [kvledger] CommitWithPvtData -> INFO 04a Channel [my-channel]: Committed block [4] with 1 transaction(s)
```
8. install CC at org2peer0

now the org2peer0 keeps logging:

When trying to query the CC in org2peer0
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 06:37:15 GMT):<br/>
what is the endorsement policy?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 06:37:40 GMT):<br/>
so - it seems that `org2peer0` doesn't "see" `org1peer0`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 06:37:46 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 06:38:41 GMT):<br/>
it's not included in the peer container
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 06:38:58 GMT):<br/>
you can use it on your machine given that you can resolve the peer's host address
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 06:39:14 GMT):<br/>
you can download the binary

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:24:14 GMT):<br/>
and is this metadata the same when you query the peer on org0?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:27:50 GMT):<br/>
Yes, in org1peer0 the logs for `Returning metadata for channel my-channel` are exactle the same 
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:31:58 GMT):<br/>
If you think a call would help, we can also do this ;)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:34:23 GMT):<br/>
hold on @Kyroy ... 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:34:44 GMT):<br/>
I now realized that when you did the `discover peers`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:34:54 GMT):<br/>
then org1 and org2 peers don't see each other
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:35:02 GMT):<br/>
am  I right?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:35:40 GMT):<br/>
when you query peer0.org1 it tells you only about  itself and when you query peer0.org2 it tells you only about itself
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:35:45 GMT):<br/>
so that is the problem
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:38:55 GMT):<br/>
Yes, indeed. But e.g. the blocks from the channel are send to peer0.org2. (not sure if this is done via gossip or the orderer :thinking: )
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:43:12 GMT):<br/>
via the orderer
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:43:17 GMT):<br/>
anyway... that's the problem
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:43:30 GMT):<br/>
you probably need to add anchor peers
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:58:21 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm I finally fixed the peer problem. By just making the anchor peer transaction :facepalm_tone2: 
I just forgot that there is a separate transaction I have to do

Now the DEBUG log in the peer is `the identity is a member of a different MSP (expected Org1SAPMSP, got Org2SAPMSP)`
Which is quite clear :D

Now I have to figure out how to tell the sdk to get the endorsement from Org1 when making a TX from Org2
</p>

<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 09:24:47 GMT):<br/>
@sudeshrshetty @bstasyszyn To get the endorsement from another org (here Org1MSP), I had to do this:
```channels:
  mappedchannel:
    peers:
      peer0.org2.example.com:7351:
        endorsingPeer: true
        chaincodeQuery: true
        ledgerQuery: true
        eventSource: true

entityMatchers:
  channel:
    - pattern: (\w+)
      mappedName: mappedchannel
  peer:
    - pattern: ([\w\.]+):(\d+)
      urlSubstitutionExp: localhost:$2
      sslTargetOverrideUrlSubstitutionExp: $1
      mappedHost: peer0.org2.example.com:7351
```
I can also map it to a peer config that does not have `tlsCACerts.path` configured and it works. But I have to map it because otherwise the sdk says it is not configured and will not connect to it.

(1) is there a better way to do this? :D
(2) I have to handle a lot of different channels on different peers. So I just map every channel to `mappedchannel`, specify ALL my peers there, and filter them out by using a custom `func (c *CustomEndpointConfig) ChannelPeers(name string)`. Now with fabric1.2, is there a better way to do this?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=GfABxtFvxKLQg6Emb) @frustrated-chain If your app will be dockerized also you can put container_name in config.yaml I did this with docker-compose in my config.yaml all url's are actually docker container names not hardcoded IP's. If your app is "outside" of Kubernetes and you don't have some way to access this network (its virtual network actually) you must map K8 node's to public IP's (not hard to do). This question is not really related to this channel but hope we can help.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=7KYP4tkMEGbwkNGPi) @Kyroy There is mistake here, mappedHost in `entityMatchers.peer` is same as actual peer name.

<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 14:49:26 GMT):<br/>
Suppose: You mentioned `ABC.XYZ.COM` in channel peer name. If proper entity matcher is in place, it will resolve it to peer `peer0.org1.example.com`
</p>
<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 14:51:57 GMT):<br/>
In your case, SDK is able to find peer config in `peers` config section, so it never goes to entity matcher.
Entity matchers are not mandatory, so sdk config always looks for orderers, peers, CAs in a conventional way. If it fails, then it goes through entity matchers if any.
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 14:53:48 GMT):<br/>
It also works for peers that I have not configured, but anyways. This was not my question ;)

To get the endorsement from another org (here Org1MSP), I had to do this:
...
I can also map it to a peer config that does not have `tlsCACerts.path` configured and it works. But I have to map it because otherwise the sdk says it is not configured and will not connect to it.

(1) is there a better way to do this? :D
(2) I have to handle a lot of different channels on different peers. So I just map every channel to `mappedchannel`, specify ALL my peers there, and filter them out by using a custom `func (c *CustomEndpointConfig) ChannelPeers(name string)`. Now with fabric1.2, is there a better way to do this?

```
I will have a lot of channels on different peers. Created dynamically. So I do not want to add all of them to `channels`.  But if I only use 1 `mappedchannel` the sdk thinks all peers are in the channel. (when not using this custom ChannelPeers).
And it tries to connect to these peers to get channel info (discovery) and then logs:
``` [fabsdk/client] 2018/06/28 15:27:17 UTC - dynamicdiscovery.(*ChannelService).evaluate -> WARN error getting peers from discovery response: access denied
```
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 15:30:27 GMT):<br/>
With the discovery service, it should be possible not to configure `channels` at all, right?

It seems that I made one more blunder and did not create network-config.yaml but I recall seeing the implementation in Nodejs SDK examples. I will check and see if these changes work but if you have any known resource or example using network-config.yaml then please point me to it. Thanks!

I have been using hyperledger fabric to develop my chaincode and have successfully instantiated on a channel with multiple organizations.
The endorsement policies have been set to be signed by all the organization using the consensus protocol, but I am not able to understand how would I accept the transaction when I call the invoke function
Do I have to pass some parameters in the arguments for the same? 
Please help me understand how to enable signing in the case of all the organizations agreeing to the transaction

I have tried tweaking ccPolicy with various options but keep getting the same error so guessing that I am not even looking at the right place. 
Any pointers would be helpful.

<p><strong>bstasyszyn</strong> (Thu, 05 Jul 2018 23:06:42 GMT):<br/>
@pankaj13 The error "Incorrect number of arguments. Expecting 4]" is returned from the "Init" function of the chaincode that you're instantiating. When you instantiate a chaincode you need to specify the arguments that the chaincode expects. I believe that this error is coming from https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/22a0f775f826bf3a9bf7364e9b8ab0a7686cf711/test/fixtures/testdata/src/github.com/example_cc/example_cc.go#L42
</p>
<p><strong>pankaj13</strong> (Thu, 05 Jul 2018 23:39:29 GMT):<br/>
thanks, I just figured it out too and rushed here to update!! The fix was simple and only had to add "Init" at the beginning of arguments passed to chaincode. Thanks for pointing it out.

@gen_el The SDK discovers the orderers from the channel config block. Do you have that endpoint configured in the SDK configuration either directly or via entityMatchers? fyi: @sudeshrshetty is working on enhancements to this logic to enable default endpoint configurations.

When unmarshaling the policy, I cannot get the original policy. I use:
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/third_party/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/common/cauthdsl/cauthdsl_builder.go#L165
But when I unmarshal with the following code, I get:
```resp, err := QueryChaincode(channelID, "lscc", "getccdata", /*args*/[]string{channelID, cc.Name})
if err != nil {
  ...
}
var ccData ccprovider.ChaincodeData
if err := proto.Unmarshal(resp, &ccData); err != nil {
	...
}
var sigPolicyEnv common2.SignaturePolicyEnvelope
if err := proto.Unmarshal(ccData.Policy, &sigPolicyEnv); err != nil {
	...
}
fmt.Println(sigPolicyEnv.Rule.Type) // nil
```

1.search for "vg_orderer1_1" in your project to find where it is mentioned.

the following aren't necessary if you can figure out from above

2.it's better not to use aliases or if you use try to keep the same name.
3.
Delete existing container
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q) is the command for removing all the containers(BE CAREFUL)
and 
try to run again,see if vg_orderer1_1 is being created again

Hi people, 

Rather than writing all the Network configuration logic in a Shell Script , Will that be possible to achieve it using GoLang SDK ?
Example , Creating a channel , making peers to join the channel , doing all the Certificate verification using SDKs ?
Also can someone please demonstrate how could we make the chaincode interact with front-end. How could we make RestAPIs using Go SDK ? share us some sample program..
</p>
<p><strong>bstasyszyn</strong> (Fri, 06 Jul 2018 12:14:56 GMT):<br/>
@Kyroy Not sure what the problem is. What policy did you provide when the chaincode was instantiated?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Fri, 06 Jul 2018 12:16:41 GMT):<br/>
@bstasyszyn I used `cauthdsl.SignedByAnyMember([]string{"Org1MSP"})` - https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/third_party/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/common/cauthdsl/cauthdsl_builder.go#L165

<p><strong>bstasyszyn</strong> (Fri, 06 Jul 2018 12:34:09 GMT):<br/>
@Kyroy Can you try using the CLI to display the CC policy: https://github.com/securekey/fabric-examples/tree/master/fabric-cli. Command: go run fabric-cli.go chaincode info --ccid mychaincode --cid mychannel --config ../../test/fixtures/config/config_test_local.yaml --peer localhost:7051

@bstasyszyn Thanks for the hint. The code does use the right user name (admin) but it seems the UserStore isn't there. It's looking for /tmp/state-store but that doesn't exist.

```v1.2.0: Could not introduce github.com/hyperledger/fabric@v1.2.0, as it has a dependency on github.com/spf13/viper with constraint 1967d93db724f4a5c0e101307e96d82ff520a067, which has no overlap with existing constraint master from github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go@master```

Hi guys, what is the best way to set the logging level? I have tried `logging.SetLevel("", logging.DEBUG)` at the very begin, but it seems does't work.

</p>
<p><strong>tian</strong> (Tue, 10 Jul 2018 06:46:17 GMT):<br/>
It looks like your peer is not running, so nobody is listening at localhost:7051

I have created network, deployed chaincode from fabric-sdk-java client application, and now trying to create a new fabric-sdk-go client. Fabric-sdk-go client to be able to submit transactions on existing channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Jul 2018 06:57:40 GMT):<br/>
if you have connectivity, but you can't connect - then probably you're running with TLS, and the peer's TLS certificate doesn't have the localhost as its DNS SAN
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Jul 2018 06:58:31 GMT):<br/>
what you can do, to test - is edit on your local computer the `/etc/hosts` file and put there the peer's DNS name - `peer0.org1.bla.bla.bla` as `127.0.0.1`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Jul 2018 06:58:34 GMT):<br/>
and then see if it works
</p>
<p><strong>MahimaManik</strong> (Tue, 10 Jul 2018 06:59:02 GMT):<br/>
Okay thanks, let me try

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=gcw8E2MHGFRR7ennQ) @yacovm I tried this, but the problem still persists..
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Jul 2018 07:08:41 GMT):<br/>
hmmm you should try then to capture the output via tcpdump
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Jul 2018 07:08:53 GMT):<br/>
and then use wireshark to look at what happens
</p>
<p><strong>MahimaManik</strong> (Tue, 10 Jul 2018 07:10:10 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm It should be feasible right to have one java-client and the other go-client?
</p>
<p><strong>MahimaManik</strong> (Tue, 10 Jul 2018 07:11:37 GMT):<br/>
I updated config_test.yaml for org, channel, ca, client details
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Jul 2018 07:11:37 GMT):<br/>
obviously... fabric is language independant ;) 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Jul 2018 07:11:53 GMT):<br/>
but i think golang SDK is the best in terms of features
</p>
<p><strong>MahimaManik</strong> (Tue, 10 Jul 2018 07:12:27 GMT):<br/>
Yes, it has very clear separation for Run and RunWithoutSetup. Works like charm! 
</p>
<p><strong>MahimaManik</strong> (Tue, 10 Jul 2018 09:32:45 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=8jXSWjmrpKxNuRwPG) @yacovm I tried tcpdump, there were no packets received on 7051 port
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Jul 2018 09:33:42 GMT):<br/>
that might be problematic... ensure you're listening to the right interface
</p>
<p><strong>MahimaManik</strong> (Tue, 10 Jul 2018 09:34:28 GMT):<br/>
We tried 'any' interface. Command used: `tcpdump -n -i any "port 7051" -v`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Jul 2018 09:34:59 GMT):<br/>
so I don't know further than that... wait for the go SDK guys to wake up

> - if provided, entitiy matcher lookup will take precedence over exact match.
@troyronda  @sudeshrshetty  So if I have a very general entity matcher for peers without a `tlsCACerts`, I have to add another one that matches to my specified peers, e.g.:
```- pattern: (\w).org1.example.com:(\d+)1
      mappedHost: $1.org1.example.com:${2}1
    # for endorsements on other peers

@yacovm @MahimaManik @tian The usual culprit for this error are (1) Peer is actually down; (2) Network / Docker mapping problems; (3) TLS problems... as you guys have been discussing above.

With TLS, you need to make sure the name being used to dial matches the name in the certificate.

:thinking: hello guys...

<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 06:34:37 GMT):<br/>
@sudeshrshetty I have the following peers:
- peer0.org1.example.com:7051
- peer1.org1.example.com:7151
- peer0.org2.example.com:7351
running on localhost on the same ports.

All of these peers are joined to my channel. But only the peers from org1 are configured in my sdk. I use the entityMatcher from my previous post.
I also have implemented a custom `ChannelPeers` method that only returns the peers from org1.

But e.g. when I instantiate CC, the sdk tries to get the tx event from the peer in org2. I guess because of the discovery, right?
Is this a bug or a misconfiguration from my side?

```{"level":"debug","msg":"CustomEndpointConfig.ChannelPeers(my-test-channel): [peer1.org1.example.com:7151 peer0.org1.example.com:7051]","time":"2018-07-11T08:25:57+02:00"}

```
PS: The connection timeout is because the `mapped.peer` does not have a `tlsCACerts.path` defined.

@david_w a) this is not a sdk question, but this may help you https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.2/sampleconfig/core.yaml
b) you should not expect an answer within minutes. People are living all over the world an may be in bed or somewhere else ;)

Is there any example in fabric-sdk-go where client wants to submit transaction to remote channel (`docker ps` on client's machine is empty) ?

</p>
<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 13:59:22 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=K2NH9sXAug4EQQce3) @Kyroy For this entity matcher config, it should not happen
Do you have any other pattern defined here?
`- pattern: (\w).org1.example.com:(\d+)1
      mappedHost: $1.org1.example.com:${2}1
    # for endorsements on other peers
    - pattern: ([\w\.]+):(\d+)1
      urlSubstitutionExp: ...
      eventUrlSubstitutionExp: ...
      sslTargetOverrideUrlSubstitutionExp: ...
      mappedHost: mapped.peer:7051`
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 14:00:03 GMT):<br/>
@sudeshrshetty no, I only have these 2. And it is working with the commit before
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 14:00:14 GMT):<br/>
But it doesn't work with the refactor commit
</p>
<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 14:17:53 GMT):<br/>
@Kyroy Will look into this too
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 14:25:54 GMT):<br/>
@sudeshrshetty Oh, wait. I was looking at something else. So the peer from the other org thing was also before. It is caused by the entityMatcher `pattern: ([\w\.]+):(\d+)1`. But if I do not use this matcher, I am not able to get endorsements from other orgs.
</p>
<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 14:30:54 GMT):<br/>
@Kyroy I am not sure if we had `$` support for mapped host before. Are you sure about that? I ran few tests with old code and it never worked.
It is nice to have feature though, anyway I am going to put `$` mapped host in upcoming commit
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 14:34:00 GMT):<br/>
It works with this commit `b5453c1d86b35772c78e103907512d9a6a706fc7`

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:13:48 GMT):<br/>
oh....I think I know why that happens
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:13:53 GMT):<br/>
but I don't know how to fix it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:14:09 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda why do you guys use discovery for QSCC? :/ 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:14:22 GMT):<br/>
or did she use the go SDK in a wrong way?
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:15:04 GMT):<br/>
I am planning on using the sdk for some custom system chaincodes. I had it working, but once I updated Fabric to 1.2 I started getting these errors. Is this an effect of the new release?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:17:09 GMT):<br/>
It is related to the new release
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:17:28 GMT):<br/>
though I don't know if it's something you're doing wrong or not
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:17:45 GMT):<br/>
but - you're *not* supposed to query service discovery for system chaincodes
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:19:52 GMT):<br/>
I agree. I think the sdk provides a special implementation for the typical system chaincodes like `qscc` so it doesn't go through the discovery service. My real problem is that I have a system chaincode plugin which I would need to use the regular query process. My question then becomes is there a way to bypass the discovery service
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:20:48 GMT):<br/>
I don't understand even why it goes for SD - since it's not a transaction.... it's a query 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:21:22 GMT):<br/>
if you want to query a peer - what I'd do as an SDK writer - is do a peer membership query, get the chaincodes, and select those that contain the chaincode i need
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:21:36 GMT):<br/>
though - everyone has QSCC installed on them..... 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:24:14 GMT):<br/>
@swetha maybe you can bypass that by having a regular chaincode that just calls the system chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:28:30 GMT):<br/>
I am developing a fabproxy for the `evmscc`. Having to deploy another chaincode to be able to interact with the evm seems like step too much. Deploying the `evmscc` as a regular chaincode seems like a better solution at that point. But I am sure this will become a common problem if you can't use the sdk to interact with custom system chaincodes
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:29:30 GMT):<br/>
This will not become a common problem since it's uncommon to do anything that isn't in the fabric samples
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:38:24 GMT):<br/>
Is the expectation then as more system chaincodes are developed they should be added to the SDK?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:39:36 GMT):<br/>
@swetha are you calling QSCC from your chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:40:22 GMT):<br/>
No, I am not doing chaincode invocation from a chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:40:57 GMT):<br/>
ah - so qscc was something you tried.
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:40:59 GMT):<br/>
I am trying to call a system chaincode through the channel client's `Query` or `Execute` methods 
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:41:14 GMT):<br/>
Yes the qscc was me verifying that it is a problem with all system chaincodes
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:41:48 GMT):<br/>
I am trying to interact with a custom system chaincode so I can't use the ledger querier
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:43:51 GMT):<br/>
So the short answer is that we have used a custom invocation handler for this type of query
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:43:51 GMT):<br/>
So the short answer is that we have used a custom invocation handler for this type of query
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:44:02 GMT):<br/>
(I mean in our projects)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:44:02 GMT):<br/>
(but this hasn't been put into the SDK as of yet)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:45:26 GMT):<br/>
This custom invocation handler is basically choosing a random channel peer instead of using discovery
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:45:55 GMT):<br/>
(whenever we have done something "special", we have used these custom handler... it makes things quite flexible)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:46:01 GMT):<br/>
Sounds to me like a solid resolution
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:47:40 GMT):<br/>
here is the out-of-the-box handler for execute: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/c32f0e14f463dc13cda25eb4446d0135d9944f12/pkg/client/channel/invoke/txnhandler.go#L199
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:49:53 GMT):<br/>
Okay so if I understand correctly I should use a custom handler instead of that one to bypass discovery. I can use something like the ledger querier as an example?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 20:54:27 GMT):<br/>
@swetha yes you should use a custom handler for now and pass it to InvokeHandler (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/c32f0e14f463dc13cda25eb4446d0135d9944f12/pkg/client/channel/chclient.go#L146)

If the following doesn't work in official sample,one should understand what kind of hurdles Hyperledger Fabric provides when you dive deep in.

cd fabric-samples/first-network/

Hello! I have a question in terms of initializing the fabsdk and customizing it using the Options functions. Is that not a feature we should be using? If I understand correctly Option is a function that takes in `*fabsdk.options` as a parameter, but that is an unexported struct.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 14 Jul 2018 00:37:12 GMT):<br/>
@swetha you should be using the Options functions. fabsdk.options does not need to be exported to use them.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 14 Jul 2018 00:37:41 GMT):<br/>
the sdk initialization passed the options type into the func when it calls it.
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Sat, 14 Jul 2018 01:09:11 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda, we can't create a function that takes that type in though

//TODO : peerconfig and ordererconfig search by unmatched URL

When is this TODO implemented? It is really critical for getting endorsements, right?

Hello team, im fairly new to the go sdk but i have experiences in node and java sdk. I've noticed that channel.Request has chaincodeID, but no way of specifying chaincode version. Is this intended and the request will automatically invoke/execute the latest chaincode?

Hey Guys, I'm new to Chaincode dev. I'm currently using `fabric-sdk-go`.  

I need a way to call `invoke` or `query` without storing the private key in a file.    
I currently have the privatekey in a variable and I do not want to store it locally before an invoke call.  Is this possible?

If its helpful, these paths are where invoke expects my keys:
```
// The fabric user private key is saved to the following file:
//        <SDKConfigPath>/crypto-config/allorgs/omitted/<username>@omitted/msp/keystore/<hexOfCertSKI>_sk
// The fabric user public key is saved to the following path:
//        <SDKConfigPath>/crypto-config/allorgs/omitted/<username>@omitted/msp/signcerts/<username>@omitted-cert.pem
```

could you elaborate @huy.tranibm? I'm not following.  Users are already enrolled, and I have their Certificates, but I dont know how to "use the users enrollment" . 
</p>
<p><strong>huy.tranibm</strong> (Mon, 16 Jul 2018 21:12:44 GMT):<br/>
ideally in a client application, u shouldn't be storing those certs. a user object has enrollment(priv key and certs). When u register a user, u get back from the ca the privkey/cert, its up to you how you manage those materials
</p>
<p><strong>Russ.corsha</strong> (Mon, 16 Jul 2018 21:18:35 GMT):<br/>
@huy.tranibm I receive the cert, and have it secured in a keystore. Unfortunately the invoke command does not seem to allow me to "manage those materials".  
It seems to require the certs be stored at a specific location.  Here Is the specific file in the repo that forces me to do: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/81694dd6232d5b0c9721c1da1e5bdf331f77d15b/pkg/msp/filekeystore.go

Hey everyone, recently got started with Fabric and Fabric-sdk-go and I have a 4 organization / 1 channel network going.
I tested my network using the cli and everything worked correctly and I'm now working on a client that uses fabric-sdk-go.
For some reason, when I query my ledger, I'll sometimes get an error code (11) where the sdk cannot find a suitable endorsement for my query, but it works 90% of the time. Any ideas what's causing this flakyness?
</p>
<p><strong>pgarneau</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 12:32:40 GMT):<br/>
This is the exact error message I'm getting: `Failed to query: Failed to get endorsing peers: Discovery status Code: (11) UNKNOWN. Description: error getting endorsers: no endorsement combination can be satisfied`. The weird thing, is that this error doesn't happen all the time. Could it be certain connections within the network timing out?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 14:54:05 GMT):<br/>
Can I somehow get the txID before the tx is commited to the peer? And afterwards get notified before it is send to the orderer?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=YNu5xqdicJmhiGLFm) @Kyroy You can create invocation handlers to customize the logic.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 14:56:47 GMT):<br/>
The defaults are here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/invoke/txnhandler.go
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 14:57:29 GMT):<br/>
You can then pass your customized handler chain into the client using this func: https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pkg/client/channel#Client.InvokeHandler
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 14:58:07 GMT):<br/>
btw - Execute and Query do the same. e.g., https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/chclient.go#L111

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 14:59:52 GMT):<br/>
It's likely a good improvement to add additional invocation chains into the SDK but there is only these ones at the moment.

<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 15:07:21 GMT):<br/>
So did you reimplement the channel.Client or did you override some of the functions?

<p><strong>pgarneau</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 15:24:43 GMT):<br/>
It's just the flakyness that's bothering me, I tried using the vscode debugger to try and see the path the sdk takes to extract endorsers and I couldn't get any valuable info. Im doing the `dep ensure -update` atm and I'll try it out. Have you seen the error I posted before?

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 15:24:54 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 15:29:18 GMT):<br/>
So the SDK uses the Fabric Peer's service discovery to select peers for endorsement. If a peer or network is flaky, then you can get these errors if that peer is needed to satisfy your endorsement policy. 
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 15:29:48 GMT):<br/>
but it's pretty hard to say just from an error message, of course.
</p>
<p><strong>pgarneau</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 15:30:06 GMT):<br/>
Thing is, I have a total of 8 peers running and I'm using a "SignedByAnyPeer" from 4 organizations. I don't get how it can be that flaky
</p>
<p><strong>pgarneau</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 15:30:39 GMT):<br/>
Works well maybe 60-70% of the time
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 15:31:35 GMT):<br/>
@bstasyszyn might have more thoughts
</p>
<p><strong>pgarneau</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 15:32:28 GMT):<br/>
Also when I check the logs form my orderer and my peers, nothing shows up when the SDK fails
</p>
<p><strong>pgarneau</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 15:34:47 GMT):<br/>
Is it normal that chaincode instantiates and queries launch random peer chaincodes btw? @troyronda 
</p>
<p><strong>pgarneau</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 15:42:07 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda I downsized my SDK config to 2orgs with 2 peers each and it is much more stable. Could it be an issue with timeouts because my computer is having a hard time managing 8 peers?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 15:46:14 GMT):<br/>
@pgarneau it can take sometime for chaincode to build when being used for the first time on a peer.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 15:47:12 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=sWsd6oZPHgKdqa5mH) @pgarneau Yes in the default case, the SDK uses whichever peer satisfies the endorsement policy
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 15:48:09 GMT):<br/>
This can be overridden if you pass an explicit list of peers into the client. 
</p>
<p><strong>pgarneau</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 15:50:47 GMT):<br/>
Thing is, when I was running 8 peers, at some point I had all 8 chaincode containers running and I was still running into my issue so it doesn't seem to be related to the time it takes to init a new chaincode container
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 16:04:58 GMT):<br/>
@pgarneau it can also take sometime for the discovery information to propagate between the peers after startup.

@troyronda This is a SS of 11 queries. This is with 6 peers from different orgs.

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 16:09:44 GMT):<br/>
Maybe try waiting after instantiating the chaincode before attempting the queries

@pgarneau Im no expert, but from what I'm seeing this error tends to come up when a channel is attempted to be made b4 the peer is ready.  (Alot of people seem to jump on the chaincode isnt initialized yet but you seem to have that covered) . 
I suggest 
1) taking a look at ports, like in this stack overflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45453405/unable-to-connect-peer-to-channel-in-hyperledger-fabric

2) or maybe its a concurrency issue where you are bombarding the peers with requests and you cpu has to handle all the chaincode running at the same time.  Maybe slow down ur testing?

Its a longshot, but how many peers are you hitting when asking for endorsements?  If one of the org ips your requesting has a typo, it could be as simple as you dont get enough endorsements when you hit the bad org's peers. That would cause it to only fail once in a while.

<p><strong>pgarneau</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 18:43:12 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda Are there any special procedures required to instantiate a couchDB enabled chaincode from the go sdk? My instantiate command starts my `hyperledger/fabric-ccenv` container, but it hangs there while my CPU usage goes through the roof. Any tips? 

Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 18:46:31 GMT):<br/>
@pgarneau one reason this happens is that Fabric is building a chaincode image containing the compiled binary from the Go source code that was "installed". This isn't specific to CouchDB though.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 18:47:13 GMT):<br/>
(or the SDK)
</p>
<p><strong>pgarneau</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 18:47:27 GMT):<br/>
Yeah but it hangs there forever, it never finshes and the sdk ends up timing out its request.
```
Unable to install and instantiate CC: Failed to instantiate chaincode: sending deploy transaction proposal failed: Transaction processing for endorser [localhost:8051]: gRPC Transport Status Code: (4) DeadlineExceeded. Description: context deadline exceeded
panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
```
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 18:48:00 GMT):<br/>
yup - so when you try this one a single box with a lot of peers, the box struggles to build all these chaincodes.
</p>
<p><strong>pgarneau</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 18:48:28 GMT):<br/>
Reduced my number of peers to 2 to test that theory
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 18:48:38 GMT):<br/>
In some of our CI tests, we "warm up" the CC by triggering builds more slowly :).

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 18:48:51 GMT):<br/>
(i.e., calling peers one at a time)
</p>
<p><strong>pgarneau</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 18:49:12 GMT):<br/>
hmm so if my install is successful, then I should possibly try to give the instantiate more time?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 18:49:24 GMT):<br/>
you can increase the timeouts.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 18:49:58 GMT):<br/>
you may have to increase the timeouts on the peer's core.yaml too
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 18:50:19 GMT):<br/>
also make sure you are giving your docker daemon lots of RAM and CPUs.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 18:50:30 GMT):<br/>
The defaults don't work well in this situation.
</p>
<p><strong>pgarneau</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 18:52:38 GMT):<br/>
Ill try and bump up the RAM and CPU
</p>
<p><strong>pgarneau</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 18:52:43 GMT):<br/>
and keep scaling down till it works
</p>
<p><strong>pgarneau</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 18:53:41 GMT):<br/>
This is going on a beefy compute engine later, but want to try and get it to work locally first

cool.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 18:54:46 GMT):<br/>
as a side-note, in the SDK CI tests, I mocked out ccenv to enable faster tests since we install many CCs and policies :P.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 18:54:55 GMT):<br/>
obviously not a good idea outside tests.

@troyronda Does using couchdb change the way ChaincodeEvents are created / generated?
</p>
<p><strong>pgarneau</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 20:18:56 GMT):<br/>
I can successfully query / invoke my chaincode with correct data while using couchdb, however the part of my client that verifies that a chaincode event was received is not working anymore
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 20:19:43 GMT):<br/>
@pgarneau I'm not aware of CouchDB changing chaincode events behavior.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 20:20:07 GMT):<br/>
I assume your chaincodes are not taking a long time to run?

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 20:23:23 GMT):<br/>
chaincode events come from the peers
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 20:23:46 GMT):<br/>
(after they commit the transactions received from the orderer)

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 22 Jul 2018 19:47:31 GMT):<br/>
There isn't a client docker image available, from a simple reason
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 22 Jul 2018 19:47:55 GMT):<br/>
the peer and the orderer are basically naked binaries, running inside their containers, and you don't need to care how they work, or what is inside of the containers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 22 Jul 2018 19:47:59 GMT):<br/>
it's like a black box
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 22 Jul 2018 19:48:14 GMT):<br/>
however - the client, is actually an SDK (most likely... unless it's a CLI)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 22 Jul 2018 19:48:27 GMT):<br/>
that SDK can't live on its own, it's embedded in an application that drives business logic
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 22 Jul 2018 19:48:39 GMT):<br/>
so obviously there is no docker image for the SDK, since it's a library - not a binary
</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong> (Sun, 22 Jul 2018 19:49:36 GMT):<br/>
ah, that makes a lot of sense.  I was thinking it would be nice to have a preconfigured one as a sample,  but that wouldn't help much, you're right
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 22 Jul 2018 19:50:47 GMT):<br/>
But keep in mind it's not that simple as it looks... because the production orderer is kafka, which means it uses Zookeeper and Kafka 
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 22 Jul 2018 19:51:01 GMT):<br/>
so the maintenance, security patching, etc. of these both servers is up to you as a user
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 22 Jul 2018 19:51:15 GMT):<br/>
There are docker images available, and you can connect to Kafka with TLS, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 22 Jul 2018 19:51:26 GMT):<br/>
but it's not really a black box as the peer binary is
</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong> (Sun, 22 Jul 2018 19:52:11 GMT):<br/>
understood, I was simplifying it for the example - I was focused on the client
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 22 Jul 2018 19:52:19 GMT):<br/>
Hopefully though, in 2019 we'll have a new ordering service that is plug&play ;) 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 22 Jul 2018 19:52:29 GMT):<br/>
just put batteries and you're all set
</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong> (Sun, 22 Jul 2018 19:52:59 GMT):<br/>
oh wow, that would be nice - using PBFT?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 22 Jul 2018 19:53:17 GMT):<br/>
first Raft then PBFT
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 22 Jul 2018 19:53:43 GMT):<br/>
Raft is using the Raft library of coreos's etcd
</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong> (Sun, 22 Jul 2018 19:54:37 GMT):<br/>
ah, is that the only Go library for that?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 22 Jul 2018 19:54:49 GMT):<br/>
no but it's the most battle tested

I need a bit of help with handling identity management.

All of the Fabric / Fabric SDK docs / examples seem to place all the crypto material in the same place, which is fine for development but not good for production.  I don't have identity management experience, and am having trouble understanding how to separate this material.

For example, in the config.yaml for the SDK, the section below seems to indicate that the entire MSP directories should be included at the respective paths, but that can't be possible because the user's private keys should remain on their local machine, correct?  *Can anyone help me understand the best practice around handling the private keys for admins / users and what should be in the _production_ version of the SDK MSP paths?*  Thanks!

```
cryptoconfig:
    path:

  credentialStore:  #I am assuming my user enrollments go through this client, so this should be included
    path: 

    cryptoStore:
      path: 
```

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 24 Jul 2018 14:38:59 GMT):<br/>
@sean FYI: the Go SDK can also use PKCS11 for storing keys or usage of environment variables. You can also manually define users in the SDK config rather than using the cryptoconfig convention.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 24 Jul 2018 14:39:46 GMT):<br/>
Beyond that, you can override the implementation. There has also been a proposal and some work into integrating with hashicorp vault.

`Orderer Server Status Code: (400) BAD_REQUEST. Description: error authorizing update: error validating ReadSet: existing config does not contain element for [Group]  /Channel/Application/Org1MSP but was in the read set`
Sometimes it's more like
`existing config does not contain element for [Group]  /Channel/Application but was in the read set`
or
`error validating ReadSet: existing config does not contain element for [Value]  /Channel/Consortium but was in the read set`
Does anyone have a suggestion?

Could you give an example as well how to run a test once the docker containers are up?

<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Fri, 27 Jul 2018 11:44:34 GMT):<br/>
When I use the `_default` options, are they also applied to my other hosts? So are these options applied to `peer0.org1.example.com`?
```peers:
  _default:
    grpcOptions:
      keep-alive-time: 0s
      keep-alive-timeout: 20s
      keep-alive-permit: false
      fail-fast: false
      allow-insecure: false
  peer0.org1.example.com:
    url: localhost:7051
    eventUrl: localhost:7053
    grpcOptions:
      ssl-target-name-override: peer0.org1.example.com
    tlsCACerts:
      path: ${GOPATH}/src/xxxx/test/fixtures/node1/crypto/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/tlsca/tlsca.org1.example.com-cert.pem

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=i5CtXtYHvdxbb5ExK) @oreg I already did, after docker-compose run tests directly in test directory using `go test -run <TESTNAME>

<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Fri, 27 Jul 2018 14:20:17 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=Ngoa3ghF7GSynFp7x) @Kyroy `_default` is fallback configuration for all the peer configs. In your case, `ssl-target-name-override` will be taken from `peer0.org1.example.com`, reset will be taken from `_default.grpcOptions`
</p>

<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Fri, 27 Jul 2018 14:21:27 GMT):<br/>
You can skip `mappedhost` too in in entitymatchers, that one will use `_default` as default mapped host
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Fri, 27 Jul 2018 14:22:21 GMT):<br/>
@sudeshrshetty Thanks :) Yes is removed my mappedhost, too. Just to clarify, the result of the above config is:
```peer0.org1.example.com:
    url: localhost:7051
    eventUrl: localhost:7053
    grpcOptions:
        ssl-target-name-override: peer0.org1.example.com
        keep-alive-time: 0s
        keep-alive-timeout: 20s
        keep-alive-permit: false
        fail-fast: false
        allow-insecure: false
    tlsCACerts:

```
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Fri, 27 Jul 2018 14:23:05 GMT):<br/>
In fact, I do not use `peers` in the entityMatchers at all now :)

How do i discover all mspID/orgs on my channel?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Fri, 27 Jul 2018 20:31:28 GMT):<br/>
@gen_el One way is to query the latest config block with https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pkg/client/ledger#Client.QueryBlock

Another one would be to use dynamic discovery:
https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pkg/fabsdk#FabricSDK.ChannelContext
```chCfg, err := chCtx.ChannelService().ChannelConfig()
for _, m := range chCfg.MSPs() {
	var mspCfg fabricMsp.FabricMSPConfig
	if err := proto.Unmarshal(m.Config, &mspCfg); err != nil {
		...
	}
```

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 27 Jul 2018 22:51:13 GMT):<br/>
The node.js and java SDKs are implementing the more advanced discovery features - cc2cc and collections.
1) Please feel free to give ideas of what the SDK should do and how the cc2cc and collections support should be designed in https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-11374 since the go SDK already did that.
2) How does the golang SDK handle collections? Does it simply give the user an ability to pass the collections?

Hi, I'm facing a grpc problem using the SDK right now. The SDK is able to connect to a bunch of peers but it fails with and `dialing connection timed out` error when I try to connect to the orderer. The orderer can see the connection handshake and logs an 
``` grpc: Server.Serve failed to complete security handshake from "172.21.0.1:45832": remote error: tls: bad certificate``` error. Using ```openssl s_client -CAfile``` i can verify the key chain for the orderer TLS setup. Using ```godebug=http2debug=2``` i cannot see anything related to a rejected cert of other TLS issue.

I have tested fabric-sdk-go `Excute`  and `Query`  to fabric-release-1.2.0 successfully,but fabric-ca-release-1.2.0 is bad . However,fabric-sdk-node can do that including fabric-ca.

@sudeshrshetty I found that the `certificateAuthorities.ca1.tlsCACerts.pem` is a list of string in endpoint configuration, but in peers and orders the `tlsCACerts.pem` is a string, and I also found that in java and node sdk the config `certificateAuthorities.ca1.tlsCACerts.pem` is also a string. So I am wondering why we set `tlsCACerts.pem` to a list of string for certificateAuthorities? Do we need to make it be compatible with other sdk?

`release-1.2: Could not introduce github.com/hyperledger/fabric@release-1.2, as it has a dependency on github.com/spf13/viper with constraint 1967d93db724f4a5c0e101307e96d82ff520a067, which has no overlap with existing constraint master from github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go@39d47d68f0c329a80d52a1e614ed107ca3d06062`
Thanks !

Just posted this in `fabric-chaincode-dev` as well: Hey everyone, I've been facing an error while using the `InstantiateCC` method provided by the `fabric-sdk-go/pkg/client/resmgmt` package (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/55ab46a8c2a69288dda370dd335a85a300d15aa5/pkg/client/resmgmt/resmgmt.go#L121:6) and am hoping to get some help. I have two orgs (Org0, Org1), each with two peers (peer0, peer1) who have joined a common channel and I've installed the same cc onto all 4 peers. The description for `InstantiateCC` states that instantiation will happen for *all* peers in the channel. In reality, instantiation only happens for the peers belonging to the org whose context is calling `InstantiateCC`. The dev containers for those 2 peers are launched fine and I'm able to invoke methods through any peer on that one org. I then try to instantiate through the client context for the other org, but the peers believe the chaincode has already been launched on the channel (which is has, but not for the peers of this org), so an error is thrown (`Chaincode status Code: (500) UNKNOWN. Description: chaincode with name 'exchangeCC' already exists`). Has anyone successfully made a similar scenario happen or have any ideas how to solve this?

@sarah  your problem is different with mine. When you instantiate cc, you can add all peers as options to `InstantiateCC` function then all 4 peers should be able to instantiate the chaincode container

@antitoine By default the SDK uses filtered block events, which omits the payload. You need to enable block events to get payload. See https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/72a486f3a43e70cedec3bfbe3fd4347782f9b97a/test/integration/pkg/client/event/events_client_test.go#L73

@zhuxubin01 the chaincoded container runs the chaincode in the CI tests. You can look at it as mocking the chaincode to speed up the test execution and conserve resources. This is accomplished by running all the test chaincode in one container and pre-building it.

Hi, I just saw that there is a problem with the management of the MSP in the SDK. Indeed, it is impossible to use entityMatchers for certification authorities. I thought it came from my side, but the problem is also present in local integration tests. The problem is that the SSL override is not done and therefore the certificate is invalid. See errors of the MSP integration tests: 
```

1. Who's using the "name" K/V? Can it be skipped?
2. Who's using the "description" K/V? Can it be skipped?
3. What is the client.organization set to? The org's name or the org's MSP ID?
4. Let's talk about client.cryptoconfig.path. Does this imply a hard dependency on cryptogen? Put it differently, what should the folder that I point this to contain? I see the description (users' crypto keys and certs), but would it work if I were to dump everything (all users) into a single flat folder? Is some sort of hierarchy expected?
5. Assume I'm an actual application developer for a Fabric network. How do I figure out what to set the BCCSP values to? Do I match the orderer's BCCSP values, or the peer's? Should the "pin" and "label" keys be set if the default BCCSP is not PKCS11? What do I set "library" to?

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 09 Aug 2018 12:03:27 GMT):<br/>
you can use the cryptogen folder structure or define users in the config
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 09 Aug 2018 12:03:54 GMT):<br/>
if you define users then you do not need to include the cryptogen field

Another question. In `organizations.orgName.cryptoPath` we are to point to the org's MSP store, but [the example](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/config/config_test.yaml#L245) points to the user MSP directory. I get that the admin, CA, and TLS CA certs between `peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/{username}@org1.example.com/msp` and `peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/msp` are the same, but shouldn't we be pointing to the latter location for correctness?

</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Mon, 13 Aug 2018 16:13:13 GMT):<br/>
I understand that several patterns may work, but _if_ I'm reading the regex correctly, it runs the risk of turning even `peer1.org1.example.com` (if one such peer existed) into `peer0.org1.example.com:8888`.

Not sure how to proceed here. Delete lines 18-19? https://gist.github.com/kchristidis/ca38c7caf556b1571e02b521f8a60ba7#file-sdk-config-yaml-L18..L19
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Mon, 13 Aug 2018 16:40:56 GMT):<br/>
Any why is entity matcher encouraged there? What is the rationale behind this?
</p>
<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Mon, 13 Aug 2018 16:44:27 GMT):<br/>
Just to make sure people use entity matchers to override orderer not `channel.orderer`. If none provided, orderer from config block will be used.
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Mon, 13 Aug 2018 17:22:08 GMT):<br/>
I'm confused. So do I delete my channel.orderer entry, and call it a day?
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Mon, 13 Aug 2018 17:22:33 GMT):<br/>
(And what happens if a channel has multiple orderer nodes listed in the config block and I have a preference for a certain one?)

mycode:
	case ccEvent = <-notifier:

You may have to restart docker  for re-running e2e tests, e2e tests are not made for re-runs. I can see you updated tests to run them again and again within same container.
In that case you may have to update verify functions too.
Refer `test/integration/pkg` tests which runs inside same containers

Found a panic in the sdk. Probably because I misconfigured it. But I think there should be a proper error :D

hi,everyone. I have a question about the following source in /fabric-sdk-go/pkg/fab/txn/txn.go,who can kindly help to answer me.
	var errResp error
	for _, i := range rand.Perm(len(randOrderers)) {
		resp, err := sendBroadcast(reqCtx, envelope, randOrderers[i])
		if err != nil {
			errResp = err
		} else {
			return resp, nil
		}
	}
question 1
if there are more than one orderers, according this source the response from endorser peer will be sent to all of the orderers.
According to my understanding，each orderer will send the message to the kafka, the first time that be sent to kafka will be valid transaction,and the second time will be invalid.is it right
question 2 
if the first time send to the orderer1 returns no problem,and the second time send to the orderer2 returns error(for example orderer2 container stopped),what will happen in this case. the transaction of this time returned is success ?

note: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/config/config_e2e.yaml#L146 controls the policy for fetching channel config for the example channel (mychannel). minresponses is how many matches successful responses are required; maxtargets is how many peers to attempt to query at once.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 11:54:27 GMT):<br/>
e.g., if you put minresponses=1 and maxtargets=2 then the SDK should query 2 peers for channel config but only require one successful response.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=oYDXREMqWArLP2JEo) In the golang SDK examples, it uses just 1 SDK for all stuff (ordererOrg and individual orgs). But in a real deployment, each Org (ordererOrg and Org1/Org2) should have their own SDK implementation.

@sudeshrshetty ` may be by providing your own implementation of TransactionHeader` as in replacing the TransactionHeader code with my own ?

Yes

<p><strong>muralisr</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 21:05:42 GMT):<br/>
that's a thought... and simpler than replacing handler in the chain (which was another suggestion I got.. not my own!)

A config.yaml that looks like this (following @sudeshrshetty's [advice](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=tTzxJdhQRcBykwMdk)):

As someone who wishes to use the SDK, I mimic this setup by setting `cryptoconfig.path` to the parent directory of `cryptogen`'s output for my network, and I omit `credentialStore.path`. When I do that, I get the following error upon instantiating the SDK: `failed to create state store: CreateNewFileKeyValueStore failed: FileKeyValueStore path is emptyexit status 1`. Debugging this shows the FileKeyValueStore actually _needs_ a value fro `credentialStore.path`, contradicting the `unused/by/sdk/go` hint in your template. Even when this is set however, my victory in trying to tame the SDK is only short-lived. When I attempt to create a channel context, I get the following error: `failed to create channel context: failed to get client context to create channel client: user not foundexit status 1`. Debugging it leads me to the `FileKeyValueStore`'s key serializer. This function is programmed to look for my user's cert (`Admin@ClarksMSP-cert.pem`) in `credentialstore.path`. However, this directory is empty. So my question is: hen should one expect the path specified in `credentialStore.path` to be populated with certificates?

Why isn't there an easy way to dynamically create a SigningIdentity from a keypair?

</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 15:02:52 GMT):<br/>
@sudeshrshetty I am not yet 100% sure, but e.g. there is `ImportBCCSPKeyFromPEMBytes` which returns a `core.Key`. I cannot just copy&paste the method because `GetECDSAPrivateKeyImportOpts` is required, which returns a internel bccsp option. But in the function, you use reflect which only supports this internal type
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 15:06:51 GMT):<br/>
With this `core.Key` it should be pretty straight forward to implement the SingingIdentity (I hope :D)

@Kyroy This is from my older post, I think It's still correct: SDK supports three use cases: embedded credentials in client configuration, pre-enrolled users in the org's MSP directory, and dynamically enrolled users - when the cert is in the user store and the key in the crypto provider's key store. User identity is resolved by looking up the user enrollment cert first, and then looking up the matching private key. When resolving the cert, SDK first looks at the user store (@client.credentialStore.path); if cert is found, the key is looked up in the crypto provider key store (HSM or @client.credentialStore.cryptoStore.path). If the identity is not resolved, SDK looks up embedded certs in client configuration; if not found, it looks up the org's MSP directory (@organizations.<org>.cryptoPath). If not found, "user not found" is reported. Otherwise, the matching private key is first searched in embedded keys in client configuration, then in the crypto provider key store, and finally in the org's MSP directory.

I am testing private collection right now.
There are two peerOrg in the network.
Org1 and Org2.

Org1 peer:
peer0.org1.example.com
peer1.org1.example.com

Org2 peer;
peer0.org2.example.com
peer1.org2.example.com

The collection config is as follow:
```
[{
  	"name": "collection1",
  	"policy": "OR('Org1MSP.member')",
  	"requiredPeerCount": 0,
  	"maxPeerCount": 2,
  	"blockToLive": 60
  }]

```

collection1 only can be accessed by Org1 peer.

I installed chaincode on both peerOrg peers.
Then I used sdk to invoke chaincode.
SDK select two random peers to invoke the chaincode.
Since only peers in Org1 have the collection, it return error when sdk picks peers in org2 to execute the chaincode.

Is it possible to dynamically select peers which have the collection stored in the ledger?
Or do we have to config it by ourselves when invoking chaincode?

If the identity is not resolved, SDK looks up embedded certs in client configuration; if not found, it looks up the org's MSP directory (@organizations.<org>.cryptoPath). If not found, "user not found" is reported. Otherwise, the matching private key is first searched in embedded keys in client configuration, then in the crypto provider key store, and finally in the org's MSP directory.

@kostas credentialStore.path should not be needed if the certs are embedded in configuration. The error you reported is a bug, if credentialStore.path is not specified SDK shouldn't look for it and would just try to find the used elsewhere and report user not found if it cannot find it.

@kostas In the meantime, if you need more control, you can inject into SDK your own MSPProviderFactory using: https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pkg/fabsdk#WithMSPPkg.

@aleksandar.likic: I hear you when you say it's a bug. If I follow your workaround, I'm back to the message I posted on Sunday; the SDK is looking for a cert in the wrong path. I _must_ be missing something given that my setup is not exotic; I simply have a network with cryptogen artifacts and wish to set up the SDK with it. Are all of you guys here working with a different set up?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=LbWgBmT9CukdDBivz) @kostas Sorry you are having this much trouble. It is true that the SDK will look for the cert in location configured by credentialStore.path, but only as a part of a broader search. Obviously, as you don't have any certs there, it won't find any, but then it should proceed by looking up any certs embedded in the configuration file, and finally under organizations.<org>.cryptoPath. Only when all these are exhausted the SDK will report user not found. I understand you expect the cert to be found in organizations.<org>.cryptoPath, so I am guessing it is not setup correctly. You can clone fabric-go-sdk master and run 'make crypto-gen'. This will generate test data under test/fixtures/fabric/v1/crypto-config. Then you can see how this location is referenced at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/fa3c843d7b773521bbd56d0f429c87c8f6271195/test/fixtures/config/config_test.yaml#L92 and https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/fa3c843d7b773521bbd56d0f429c87c8f6271195/test/fixtures/config/config_test.yaml#L265.

@DerekC Auto-detect is the default behavior of client.Execute(...). Although, it may (initially) choose an endorser that doesn't have access to the pvt collection and then your endorsement may fail.

Hi, I have some questions about event hub in node sdk. Is event hub necessary during invoking/instantiating? 
</p>
<p><strong>xuchenhao001</strong> (Fri, 24 Aug 2018 06:27:42 GMT):<br/>
I mean, when I do `sendTransaction()`, there is an response indicate that my tx has been accepted, so must the tx be appended to the ledger?

@Kyroy I'm sorry, but I notice that fabric-sdk-go also has a event hub, so should I use that during invoking?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Fri, 24 Aug 2018 08:24:16 GMT):<br/>
@xuchenhao001 The go sdk handles the eventhub for you if you just want to make an invoke.
However, the eventhub was removed in the latest version of the go sdk because it is "deprecated' in newer fabric versions (and will be removed)

</p>
<p><strong>xuchenhao001</strong> (Fri, 24 Aug 2018 08:26:01 GMT):<br/>
So why is that deprecated? What we use to verify the tx has been committed to the ledger without event hub?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Fri, 24 Aug 2018 08:29:54 GMT):<br/>
there is another thing for events, but I don't know the details

@xuchenhao001 event hub was replaced by deliver service in Fabric 1.1. The deliver service is now used to determine if a transaction was committed.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 24 Aug 2018 10:57:24 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 24 Aug 2018 20:15:18 GMT):<br/>
@kostas @Baha-sk this is a special variable that the SDK sets to the content of metadata.CryptoConfigPath (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/2ad5906cb2aa138f8ee01d2df3d2b5b3c26f13c7/test/metadata/metadata.go)

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 24 Aug 2018 20:16:35 GMT):<br/>
The test scripts set this variable using the -X argument. E.g., https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/2ad5906cb2aa138f8ee01d2df3d2b5b3c26f13c7/test/scripts/integration.sh#L117

@bandreghetti What is your use case? If you need it only to figure out where to send endorsement requests to, go-sdk will do it for you by default. You only need to specify one (anchor) peer in your client configuration and the SDK will take it from there - discover other peers and select correct peers for endorsement based on the chaincode endorsement policy and many other factors.

Kindly suggest us a blogs/projects so that we can go through it & start our development.
Does go-sdk support creation of channels, validate peers, issue certificates, add new peers and other activities that makes up the application ? 
Had gone through various resources & didn't find any good documentations for it.
Please advice , thank you :)

I am encountering inconsistencies in how the MSP tree should be constructed.

In the `fabric-ca` library, the `lib` package [1] shows that the `Client` structure requires that the certFile be stored as `/signcerts/cert.pem`:

```
func (c *Client) Init() error {
        . . .
		certDir := path.Join(mspDir, "signcerts")
		. . .
		c.certFile = path.Join(certDir, "cert.pem")
        . . .
}
```

However, the `fabric-sdk-go` library requires two different MSP tree structures:
`filekeyvaluestore` [2] requires the certFile format `/signcerts/{userName}@{orgName}-cert.pem`:
```
func NewFileCertStore(cryptoConfigMSPPath string) (core.KVStore, error) {
	_, orgName := path.Split(path.Dir(path.Dir(path.Dir(cryptoConfigMSPPath))))
            . . .
			r := strings.NewReplacer("{userName}", ck.ID, "{username}", ck.ID)
			certDir := path.Join(r.Replace(cryptoConfigMSPPath), "signcerts")
			return path.Join(certDir, fmt.Sprintf("%s@%s-cert.pem", ck.ID, orgName)), nil
            . . .
}
```
The above path Split to find the orgName requires the MSP tree to be in the format e.g.: `/orgs/org1/users/{userName}/msp/signcerts/{userName}@{orgName}-cert.pem`, otherwise the orgName will not be found.


`certfileuserstore` [3] requires the certFile format `/signcerts/{userName}@{MSPID}-cert.pem`:
```
func storeKeyFromUserIdentifier(key msp.IdentityIdentifier) string {
	return key.ID + "@" + key.MSPID + "-cert.pem"
}
```


The most obvious solution would be to maintain multiple certFiles in the `signcerts` folders, each with the needed naming structure.  However, this seems excessively complicated.  Are there plans to simplify the MSP tree, or at least clarify the required structure in the notes?  These limitations were only found when combing through the library code.

Is there any way to get a list of all peers in the network **before** they join any channel?

the section of code that is working is here:

```
chCtx, err := sdk.ChannelContext("mainchannel", fabsdk.WithUser("Admin"), fabsdk.WithOrg("org1"))()
	discoveryService, err := chCtx.ChannelService().Discovery()

	peerList, err := discoveryService.GetPeers()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Failed to Get Peers: %s\n", err)
	}

	for _, peer := range peerList {
		log.Printf("Found peer: %s", peer.URL())
	}
```

but it only gets the peers which have already joined the channel

I'd like to get a full list of an organization's peers or, even better, of all peers connected to the network

Hi again :D
It seems there is a problem with the endorsement handler. I have 6 orgs with 1 peer each. And the following endorsement policy:
```{
            "n": 4,
            "out_of": [
                {
                    "signed_by": "backboneMSP.MEMBER"
                },
                {
                    "signed_by": "node1MSP.MEMBER"
                },
                {
                    "signed_by": "node2MSP.MEMBER"
                },
                {
                    "signed_by": "node3MSP.MEMBER"
                },
                {
                    "signed_by": "node4MSP.MEMBER"
                },
                {
                    "signed_by": "node5MSP.MEMBER"
                }
            ]
        }
```
peer from node5 went down and ALL invokes and queries failed because no endorsement policy could be satisfied.
I am sending invokes and queries to all org/peers

@aleksandar.likic I need to deploy multiple instance of client's (build with SDK) across machines. If keystore is a file-based one, I need to copy/paste keys to multiple instance whenever a new key is generated. Another solution to this keystore sharing problem is to build a reliable distributed filesystem and mount the same endpoint to serve as keystore for multiple instance, which cost a lot to our team. We want for example, a DB-based keystore.

@aleksandar.likic HSM seems like a very expensive solution if your want security, reliability and flexibility. We don't have experience with any HSM providers. For now, our test bed is virtualized, using HSM require the access to bare metal machine.
</p>
<p><strong>jamesruan</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 02:46:44 GMT):<br/>
@aleksandar.likic Could we have, for example, a DB-based key store that is flexible to network connected virtualized client?
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 03:02:05 GMT):<br/>
@jamesruan Yes, but it is not straightforward. You'll find at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/dcb2645139205ca2f39550ad8c4fc159cb0f2082/test/integration/pkg/client/msp/user_data_mgmt_test.go#L59 an example of a custom key store. Unfortunately, at the moment it has to be in-memory, as current BCCSP SW implementation (used internally by the SDK) allows serialization/deserialization of private keys only within the go package where the key implementation types are defined. The BCCSP files-based key store is in that package, so this is why it works. So, what you need would require a BCCSP patch. A good think is that the SDK uses a copy of BCCSP under its internal package (instead of normally vendoring the "real" BCCSP), so we might be able to patch it. Let me think about it and I'll get back to you.

BTW, there is another way, you can implement your own CryptoSuite interface (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/cb4ad138c14fd98039c56ab6301e665254a930bc/pkg/common/providers/core/cryptosuite.go#L32) and do whatever you want there, but it might be more work that one would want to do to solve this.

<p><strong>jamesruan</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 03:13:39 GMT):<br/>
@aleksandar.likic True. I was patching the fabric for that: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/25333/, However a strange unit test fail reported by the CI (not fail in the BCCSP).
</p>
<p><strong>jamesruan</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 03:14:25 GMT):<br/>
The issue is now move to fabric-sdk-go. So is it OK to patch it only in go SDK?

<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 03:16:22 GMT):<br/>
@jamesruan This is probably the most economic solution. If we go that route it would have to be the in the least intrusive way.

I am not exactly sure of the fix that accidently occurred for the problem mentioned above. I thing some-where chain code implementation was nor right... Chaincode installation, instantiation and invokes worked ... but it didn't create blocks (when I called chaincode via fab-cli) ... But the go sdk always gave error on unable to find peers for that chaincode... I am not sure of what change I did on chaincode but it worked for me. I started with samples simple asset chaincode and slowly added our application code - chaincode implementation to it. I did so because there are usually no problems reported against samples chaincode :-)

A chaincode query for "clarkschaincode" via the SDK references the "cscc" system chaincode in the peer and ultimately fails. A chaincode query for "clarkschaincode" via the "peer chaincode query" CLI references the "clarkschaincode" chaincode and succeeds.
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 01:55:38 GMT):<br/>
I am using the following snippet for the SDK:
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 01:55:57 GMT):<br/>
```resp, err := sc.channel.Query(channel.Request{
		ChaincodeID: "clarkschaincode",
		Fcn:         "invoke",
		Args:        [][]byte{[]byte("query"), []byte("a")},
	})```
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 01:56:31 GMT):<br/>
And the following peer CLI command respectively: `peer chaincode query --channelID clarkschannel --name clarkschaincode --ctor '{"Args":["query", "a"]}'`
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 01:57:00 GMT):<br/>
When using the SDK, the peer logs show: `validateChaincodeProposalMessage -> DEBU 8c2a validateChaincodeProposalMessage info: header extension references chaincode name:"clarkschaincode"`

@yacovm I'll be adding the patch to the fabric repo today - I just didn't have time to do it last night. The priority selector didn't give me the full picture of all the peers - it just gave two peers at a time. I needed to take the maximum block height of all peers and then prioritize based on a threshold. After I add the patch, please add comments if you have a better way.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 12:53:17 GMT):<br/>
@bstasyszyn - but can't you just feed into your custom priority selector, a state where it will put the "previously selected" peers to the end of the list?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 12:53:25 GMT):<br/>
and after a selection, you just update its state

<p><strong>bstasyszyn</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 13:23:30 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm I needed a way to have a complete picture of the block heights of all of the peers so that I can load-balance (either random or round-robin) between the ones with an acceptable block height and demote the others to a lower priority. I'm not sure I understand your suggestion about 'previously selected' peer.

@kostas (taking a guess here but @troyronda or someone would know for sure) ... I think SDK does other queries besides the "user query" and also uses other mechanisms such as peer discovery. None of which the CLI does. So some of those extra moving parts could fail in SDK. One thing that bit me (`caveat emptor!`) was failures due to what look like failing discovery mechanisms. thanks to suggestion from @troyronda did an anchor peer update to faciliate smoother discovery processes and it worked well afterwards

@binhn retry is specified using the WithRetry option. Eg https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/e2e/end_to_end.go#L174
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 08 Sep 2018 11:45:57 GMT):<br/>
this example passes in a set of default retry option.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 08 Sep 2018 11:46:49 GMT):<br/>
the channel policy holds retries for underlying mechanisms
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 08 Sep 2018 11:48:16 GMT):<br/>
(such as service discovery and querying for channel config)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 08 Sep 2018 11:51:35 GMT):<br/>
you can specify request timeouts using the WithTimeout option or in the timeout config sections under client.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 08 Sep 2018 11:58:21 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr @kostas in one of the underlying mechanisms, cscc is used to fetch the channel config block from a subset of peers.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 08 Sep 2018 12:00:35 GMT):<br/>
(btw the configuration for that mechanism is the queryChannelConfig channel policy that @binhn referenced earlier).
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Sat, 08 Sep 2018 13:28:03 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda: I am seeing references to cscc when I do:
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Sat, 08 Sep 2018 13:28:06 GMT):<br/>
```resp, err := sc.channel.Query(channel.Request{
		ChaincodeID: sc.chaincodeName,
		Fcn:         "invoke",
		Args:        [][]byte{[]byte("query"), []byte("a")},
	})```
</p>
<p><strong>kostas</strong> (Sat, 08 Sep 2018 13:28:37 GMT):<br/>
Which is not a request for fetching the config block.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Sat, 08 Sep 2018 14:36:51 GMT):<br/>
@kostas The SDK automatically fetches config blocks

Hello, can somebody help me out on a problem with the entities chaincode extension?
I try to `putState` a EC signature (entities.SignedMessage) as `[]byte`.
However, the `SignedMessage` is no longer persisted to KVS as soon as I do `Sign()` and the `SignedMessage.Sig` field is populated. How come?
My code here: https://gist.github.com/in0rdr/4a9a8f3dfc13aede5f674c4bd3067522#file-gistfile1-txt-L32

If I `putState` the `struct` without signing (i.e., I skip the call to `Sign` the `struct` is saved, but without signature.
</p>
<p><strong>in0rdr</strong> (Tue, 11 Sep 2018 15:54:16 GMT):<br/>
Also, I wrote tests similar to https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.2/examples/chaincode/go/enccc_example/enccc_test.go
They work fine locally (`go test`), but when running on a peer, the `struct` is not persisted.

Also, I might have missed these dev notes, but how should we handle users logging in from different clients?  If a user re-enrolls from a different client to obtain credentials, will this cause any issues with logging back in through a previously used client?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 11:09:49 GMT):<br/>
also I have an idea... you can use the `discover endorsers` command when all 6 organizations are up
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 11:09:56 GMT):<br/>
and see what combinations it returns
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 11:10:19 GMT):<br/>
it's clear that it skips some organizations because it thinks no peers have that chaincode installed
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 11:10:37 GMT):<br/>
but - I checked, and discovery supports `out_ouf` syntax

@sean I don't think multiple users should use a single client directly (using the same credential). If users hit fabric directly, each should have its own credential. If you have a service (in front of a fabric network) used by multiple clients you probably want to have users authenticated to the service. Mush like a traditional app server maintains DB access having only one DB credential, while users authenticate to the app server. This question is not directly related to Go SDK, you might want to post it to a more general channel to get more opinions.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=gTQWK5GEqYqnryReF) @aleksandar.likic Understood, I was not clear in my question, sorry about that.  I am assuming that after using a third-party user authentication service to verify the user for the app, the client would then <reset the client context with the logged in user (to reference the proper CA credentials)> for signing activity on the ledger.  I am wondering if there is a guideline for properly handling the CA cert/keys stored on the client.  I'm not a security expert - is it typically safe to keep those files without refresh until expiration?

An additional question - if we use a scalable host for the client that rotates the specific endpoint instance for the client that the user connects to, the local credential store for the CA credentials will not always be available (one example is AWS elastic beanstalk for hosting the client/app endpoint - it might spin up a new instance with a blank local credential store) - I am assuming that the client would then need to re-enroll the user to get new CA credentials stored locally each time the endpoint instance is rotated, is that correct?

Thanks for your help.

@DerekC so you're saying that 4 out of 6 works, but  - 4 out of 5 doesn't. 
can you perhaps try to kill a different peer?
can you perhaps try to kill 2 peers so it's 4 out of 4 ?

Whats the easiest way to start writing some go-sdk code to interact with a running fabric instance? Do i have to write that long config.yaml file before i even get started? Is there an example network / config.yaml combination i can start with?

it's automatic. you only need to point to a single (anchor) peer in your config file and the sdk takes it from there

@bstasyszyn I looked at the CR and I an not against the idea of having a 1-shot filter function, but - i still don't understand *why* the current API doesn't satisfy your use case? 
The tests you added can be implemented with the current API, can they not?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 14:22:04 GMT):<br/>

that makes sense... indeed improves the API and the expressiveness. Thanks for the change. I don't like that we now have `ExclusionFilter` and `Filter` but I can't find a better name and names aren't that important anyway

So when I instantiate a chaincode via SDK i need to build a resmgmt.InstantiateCCRequest type structure as in:

```
instantiateRequest := resmgmt.InstantiateCCRequest{
				Name:    "mychaincode",
				Path:    "github.com/myuser/mychaincode/chaincode",
				Version: "0.1",
				Policy:  ccPolicy,
			}
```

First question: where should the path field point to? The folder where the chaincode source code is in the filesystem of the machine running the sdk or the folder where it is in the peer's filesystem? Also should I point to the folder or to the source code file itself?

Second question: why must the policy field be a *SignaturePolicyEnvelope from `"github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/third_party/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/common/cauthdsl"` and not from `"github.com/hyperledger/fabric/common/cauthdsl"`? If I let gofmt auto-import the former I get an error such as:
```
cannot use ccPolicy (type *"github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/common".SignaturePolicyEnvelope) as type *"github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/third_party/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/common".SignaturePolicyEnvelope in field value
```
Everything works fine if I import the other package but I'd like to know why.

Thanks!

@bandreghetti The Path is a part of the Fabric ChaincodeID (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/c232cbf8a04a3013ad49d7a1ad9abd86f5d97df4/protos/peer/chaincode.pb.go#L99). In think that in the case of a golang CC it should be the chaincode import path, usually something like "github.com/<your CC path>". Not sure how the path is used for CCs in other languages.

@bandreghetti The Path is a part of the Fabric ChaincodeID (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/c232cbf8a04a3013ad49d7a1ad9abd86f5d97df4/protos/peer/chaincode.pb.go#L99). In think that in the case of a golang CC it should be the chaincode import path, usually something like "github.com/<your CC path>". Not sure how the path is used for CCs in other languages. See for example https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/1eb1d28713c411e25dbb68ac68df85d56b7a89b2/test/integration/e2e/end_to_end.go#L197.

@bandreghetti on the second question, fabric-sdk-go copies parts of the fabric source it needs to the "third_party" folder and imports from there, so the client application doesn't need to import fabric - as it would have many unwanted side effects, like incompatible libraries etc.

as a concept, a go 'channel' seems related to a fabric 'channel' or even a lightning 'channel' - are they all totally different concepts and only share the common name or there's something else they have in common?
</p>
<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Wed, 26 Sep 2018 16:03:58 GMT):<br/>
@aleksandar.likic I finally found out why I had the mistake when editing an identity. I sent the attributes "hf.Affiliation", "hf.EnrollmentID" and "hf.Type", which is not allowed.
But I have a more important issue, I can't instantiate another CA client with different identity (ID/secret) than the one stored in the configuration. Why ?
I create a new msp Client by providing a new context from the SDK with the identity option (fabsdk.WithIdentity) of the user. The creation works, but when I use the new client to register for example, this is the identity provided in the configuration that is used, not the identity I gave in the context.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=dGNvKryF9a2237Xhe) @greg2git I'm not very familiar with lightning channels, but here goes:

A Golang 'channel' is actually a data type the language implements to allow for inter-thread communication. You can read more about them here: https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1

A Hyperleger Fabric 'channel' is a subnet in the Fabric network that allows for transactions to occur privately between network members with access to that channel. You can read more about them here: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/channels.html

A Lightning 'channel', as far as I know, is a bidirectional channel through which two Bitcoin users can do transactions between each other without having to consult the network - nothing to do with Hyperledger.

Hey guys - what is the distributed signing identity concept in the go SDK ? 
</p>
<p><strong>bandreghetti</strong> (Wed, 26 Sep 2018 21:51:36 GMT):<br/>
Hey guys!

I'm trying to get the peer list for a channel using the following section of code:

```
    chCfg, err := resmgmtClient.QueryConfigFromOrderer(reqBody.ChannelName, resmgmt.WithOrdererEndpoint("orderer.example.com"))
	if err != nil {
		w.WriteHeader(http.StatusBadRequest)
		errmsg := fmt.Sprintf("failed to query %s channel config: %s", reqBody.ChannelName, err.Error())
		w.Write([]byte(errmsg))
		log.Print(errmsg)
		return
	}
	log.Printf("chCfg = %#v\n", chCfg)

	chCtx, err := t.sdk.ChannelContext(reqBody.ChannelName, fabsdk.WithUser("Admin"), fabsdk.WithOrg("org1"))()
	if err != nil {
		w.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
		errmsg := fmt.Sprintf("failed to create channel context: %s", err.Error())
		w.Write([]byte(errmsg))
		log.Print(errmsg)
		return
	}

	discoveryService, err := chCtx.ChannelService().Discovery()
	if err != nil {
		w.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
		errmsg := fmt.Sprintf("failed to create discovery service: %s", err.Error())
		w.Write([]byte(errmsg))
		log.Print(errmsg)
		return
	}

    peerList, err := discoveryService.GetPeers()
	if err != nil {
		w.WriteHeader(http.StatusBadRequest)
		errmsg := fmt.Sprintf("failed to get %s peers: %s", reqBody.ChannelName, err.Error())
		w.Write([]byte(errmsg))
		log.Print(errmsg)
		return
	}
```

But I get the following error from the Discovery() method:

```
failed to create discovery service: could not get chConfig cache reference: read configuration for channel peers failed
```

The channel is not configured in the `config.yaml` file used to instantiate the SDK. However I thought the channel config would be retrieved from the orderer and stored in the SDK cache by using the QueryConfigFromOrderer method, which apparently is not working. What am I doing wrong?

@aleksandar.likic I'm looking to have one instance of CA client per user enrolled in the same instance of the SDK. However, today, only the user specified in the configuration is used to communicate with the CA, for example to register a new user. The scenario is as follows:
1. The SDK is initialized with identity A to communicate with the CA.
2. Another identity B is registered by identity A (it is assumed that identity A can do so).
3. Identity B registers a user C only if B has the right to do so, using the same instance of the SDK initialized in 1.
I can't find a solution today, except to make a new instance of the SDK with a different configuration including user B's information.

Ola, can we generate the channel.tx file programatically? I only see an option to load the tx file to update the channel but not to create a new channel?

Is there a way to receive the private collection configs of a chaincode/peer?

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 01 Oct 2018 11:52:01 GMT):<br/>
@aleksandar.likic @troyronda @Kyroy Ability to retrieve collection configs was added to peer and node sdk in v1.3: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/25753/.  I've opened a jira request for go SDK to do the same: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABG-769
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Mon, 01 Oct 2018 11:52:41 GMT):<br/>
@aleksandar.likic @troyronda In general, should we open a go sdk jira each time we add a function to node sdk?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=xsnH5CkBXcPpwB5S8) @bandreghetti The SDK currently works by fetching channel config from peers and storing it in the SDK cache.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 01 Oct 2018 14:38:16 GMT):<br/>
(the SDK config is used to determine an initial set of peers to use).

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=ts7YLSwuvJzZDN3zD) @yacovm The name of the tickets/feature is probably a bit misleading - as Baha mentioned, it's just the idea that certain signatures should be generated in a first step across orgs, and then submitted as a separate step. (particularly for channel updates).

@bandreghetti the sdks are decoupled from core fabric, so ideally the sdk language of most client application demand would be prioritized. the reason node sdk has been leading is mainly historical though, due to different sets of maintainers.  there is a proposal to base the next Fabric CLI on go sdk so that would indeed be a reason to implement new features in go sdk first.

(apologize if this is doced and I should first read....) I have an env with the SDK configured to talk to 2 peers (1) which peer is used to for querying and how can I control peers to use (2) which peer is used for eventing and how can I control peers to use ... in particular, can the SDK be configured to listen for events from both peers and will not send duplicate events (when it receives identical events from both peers) ?

Hi! Anyone know what the filter refer to in this function https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/event/event.go#L106
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 14:01:58 GMT):<br/>
@muralisr you can use an endpoint filter (WithTargetFilter argument). The default version looks up the filter values using configuration. (e.g.,  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/config/config_e2e.yaml#L124 
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 14:04:03 GMT):<br/>
(From the filtered list, there are resolver and load balancing strategies in place as well - take a look at the channel policies section of the config).

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 14:08:32 GMT):<br/>
The SDK currently picks one peer at a time, but is enabled to switch peers automatically - e.g., if the peer falls behind in block height -- see BlockHeightLag. e.g., https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/config/config_e2e.yaml#L198
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 14:12:45 GMT):<br/>
@twoneks it's a filter for CC events - use a regular expression to filter for certain CC events.

Thinking that my chaincode will be executed more than once (one for each endorser peer) how should I handle the notifier challenge?? How do I know how many time should I read from the channel assuming that the number of endorser peers could grow?

@bandreghetti it's still related to gometalinter.. have you checked $GOPATH/bin/ folder to see if gomatelinter directory was updated with the version created by `make depend`
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 17:30:34 GMT):<br/>
?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 17:33:21 GMT):<br/>
@bandreghetti my bad.. .it doesn't look like gometalinter... can you backup and rename your fabric-sdk-go directory and checkout a fresh copy of the project? 
</p>
<p><strong>bandreghetti</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 17:35:19 GMT):<br/>
I did, checked out a fresh copy of fabric-sdk-go, ran `make depend` and then `make` but got the same results
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 17:36:34 GMT):<br/>
what's the time of creation of the gometalinter directory under $GOPATH/bin/ ?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 17:36:34 GMT):<br/>
what's the time/date of creation of the gometalinter directory under $GOPATH/bin/ ? @bandreghetti 
</p>
<p><strong>bandreghetti</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 17:38:40 GMT):<br/>
```~/go/bin$ ls -lt | grep gometalinter

that seems like 5 minutes ago.. so it should be good!
</p>
<p><strong>bandreghetti</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 17:39:30 GMT):<br/>
actually it is an hour ago, i'm at UTC-3 haha
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 17:39:39 GMT):<br/>
actually it's 4 minutes in the future.. oh
</p>
<p><strong>bandreghetti</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 17:40:02 GMT):<br/>
but that's when I checked out and  ran make depend I guess
</p>

but I guess it's 13:43 your time..
</p>
<p><strong>bandreghetti</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 17:41:17 GMT):<br/>
the last time I did was yesterday so we should be safe
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 17:41:23 GMT):<br/>
and you confirm running gometalinter is pointing to $GOPATH/gometalinter? (run `which gometalinter`)
</p>

<p><strong>bandreghetti</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 17:41:49 GMT):<br/>
yep

```$ which gometalinter

</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 17:42:24 GMT):<br/>

`go version` gives you 1.10.4, right?
</p>
<p><strong>bandreghetti</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 17:43:36 GMT):<br/>
yep

```$ go version
go version go1.10.4 linux/amd64```
</p>
<p><strong>bandreghetti</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 17:45:25 GMT):<br/>
I have downgraded from 1.11 yesterday, is there any possible way it could be messing up the tests?
</p>
<p><strong>bandreghetti</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 17:45:46 GMT):<br/>
I basically erased the goroot folder and replaced it with the 1.10.4 one
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 17:49:18 GMT):<br/>
on a Mac, I had 1.11 installed, then re-installed 1.10 package and had to change the symlink of go
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 17:49:42 GMT):<br/>
I suspect gometalinter is still pointing to the 1.11 version somewhere on your box
</p>
<p><strong>bandreghetti</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 17:52:45 GMT):<br/>
how so? isn't the binary file self-contained?
</p>
<p><strong>bandreghetti</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 17:54:01 GMT):<br/>
```$ gometalinter --version
gometalinter version master built from ? on```

not sure what that means haha
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 17:56:42 GMT):<br/>

on another topic, i'm getting `failed to get discovery service: could not get chConfig cache reference: no channel peers configured for channel` whenever I try to run the SDK without static channel configs in config.yaml file

channel is created and peers are joined to it by the SDK itself

shouldn't it have the channel peers configuration? where should I set/fetch this config, other than the config.yaml file?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 18:35:22 GMT):<br/>
for the metal inter issue.. are you able to revert to go 1.10.3?

for the channel topic.. is this your own example? or are you trying to run your own test application?

yes, for me that is

</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 18:37:59 GMT):<br/>
I'm running 1.10.4 and I'm getting the above errors, you're running 1.10.4 and have different errors

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=Hx6gH68n5mYPwKsuJ) @Baha-sk it is my own application

I want to be able to manage my network with it by having the least amout of static configs as possible
</p>
<p><strong>bandreghetti</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 18:38:40 GMT):<br/>
I'll revert to go1.10.3, gimme a moment
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 18:41:24 GMT):<br/>
look at the how SDK integration tests create and join a channel: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/e2e/orgs/multiple_orgs_test.go#L158 ... you need to define the channel in the config
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 18:41:49 GMT):<br/>
if you don't want to provide a static config.. then you can override your own config dynamically...
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 18:43:26 GMT):<br/>
like this: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/e2e/configless/endpointconfig_override_test.go#L105

I'll give it a shot. Right now I'm out of my element. I can get my organization's hyperledger network up (still needs some tweaks which is where the SDK comes in), but I have no idea how to integrate the SDK into the environment. Perhaps, once I understand more the SDK `README` will make more sense, but I cannot make heads or tails of how it's integrated into hyperledger fabric.

@jvsclp the SDK allows user to create client applications to the peers, look at the `test/integrations` directory of the SDK project to see examples of how one can create an sdk instance, create channel clients and query the orderer/peer, etc.

`make integration-tests` is the simplest way
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 19:46:25 GMT):<br/>
if you want to start the network for the integration tests alone, then you can use: `make dockerenv-stable-up`
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 19:46:57 GMT):<br/>
this will kick off the peers/orderers/couchdb, etc. containers without running any tests
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 19:47:56 GMT):<br/>
then in another window, you can navigate to `test/integrations/...`  to any test file, then run any of the go tests just as you would run a normal go test..

`ls -lai /opt/go/bin |grep go`

is /opt/go/bin holding the real go binaries? or is it holding symlinks only? I guess let's focus on one thing now.. starting with replacing $GOPATH/bin and running `make depend` ..

once you created your own interface, you'll have to pass it in as an option when creating the sdk (something like this: `fabsdk.WithEndpointConfig(endpointConfigImpls...)`) 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 20:42:07 GMT):<br/>
you can follow the function at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/e2e/configless/end_to_end_test.go#L28 where the option mentioned above is passed in at line 30

oh, so I'll have to create a new SDK instance? I thought it as more dynamic than that :thinking:

for the metalinter issue above, is your go binary installed in $GOPATH/bin?
</p>
<p><strong>bandreghetti</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 20:43:50 GMT):<br/>
I mean, if it creates a channel why doesn't it store the channel configs?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 20:44:12 GMT):<br/>
yes, you have to pass it in to your new SDK instance... it's a replacement of the static config file

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=qsu3XGntp6KHdS8zA) @bandreghetti ok good.. just making sure.. now that you recreated a new bin folder... you have new binaries in it after running `make depend`?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 20:50:37 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=qHqu9nbiGiTFGWoP3) @bandreghetti just as you have to create a channel config tx file before starting the client to send a channel update to the orderer/peers, adding the channel config info in the config file has to pre exist beforehand... I guess this will keep the SDK consistent. if you need to create a new channel, then create a new SDK instance.. you can always close the old SDK instance (by calling sdk.Close(), very important) and create a new one with the new channel and its config you intend to create
</p>
<p><strong>bandreghetti</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 20:54:36 GMT):<br/>
oh, so I should close the SDK and reopen it with the new config everytime I create a channel? this doesn't seem practical... are you sure this is the canonic way to do this?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 21:00:58 GMT):<br/>
creating a channel is an administrative task, I hope you don't need to create too many channels in your network...
</p>
<p><strong>bandreghetti</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 21:01:38 GMT):<br/>
yea I don't but I thought I'd only need to instantiate the SDK once
</p>
<p><strong>bandreghetti</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 21:02:18 GMT):<br/>
and never again, with it updating configs on the way
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 21:03:07 GMT):<br/>
usually, an admin application will create the channels.. and another user application will query channels , for the user, the channels should already be created... so you know which channel configs the user needs to talk to
</p>
<p><strong>bandreghetti</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 21:05:55 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/config/config_e2e_single_org.yaml#L105

this is the reason why I thought the sdk would store the channel configs

`If an app is creating channels, then it likely will not need this section.`
</p>
<p><strong>bandreghetti</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 21:26:16 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=iP68bEHB3g9SsjCZb) @Baha-sk I wanted the app to do both: be able to create channels, join peers to a channel, install and instantiate chaincodes and interact with the chaincodes

for that the user would just pass the channelID (and other needed informations according to the operation) and then the sdk would access that channel

this is why i wanted the channel configs to be fetched dynamically from orderer

It is a symptom of missing the channel section in the sdk config. It may not be directly used when updating channels, in this case the discovery service depends on it as stated in the log message.

hey all, the node sdk will be separating signing and sending of transactions in 1.3. does the go sdk support or plan to support off line signing so that clients do not explicitly communicate with fabric themselves?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 14:14:50 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith we just done distributed signing for channel updates in go SDK, where signatures can be created beforehand, sent to the network admin who will assemble all signatures then call channel updates.. are you planning to do something similar for general transactions in node SDK?
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 14:31:42 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk not exactly. im looking for functionality in which a client can sign transaction proposals with their own cert and then send a signed proposal to a separate service which will forward the signed proposal to the appropriate peers. the folks in the node-sdk will be supporting that but id love to be able to build that logic into a binary
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 15:05:59 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith currently, at a high level, the users of the SDK go client don't need to deal with transaction proposals, they only need to get a channel client and call its `execute` function, example: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/e2e/end_to_end.go#L173.. not sure if it makes sense to expose the proposals to the user. The aim is to make it easy to use the SDK to communicate with the Hyperledger network.

<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 15:07:58 GMT):<br/>
also, signing the proposal is done at the very end of `execute`, when we're about to send the proposal..

<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 15:14:06 GMT):<br/>
at a low level, one can always get a transactor instance from ChannelService to submit proposals manually. If we want to separate signing from subitting

</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 15:16:44 GMT):<br/>
not sure at what level a binary would be useful to the node SDK though as the logic depends on the framework around go SDK's channel transactor api..
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 17:04:33 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk to clarify i don't want to use the binary to extend the node-sdk. i want to be able to compile a binary whose sole responsibility is to sign transaction proposals
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 17:15:11 GMT):<br/>
@jrosmith and output the signed tx proposal, then you'll import these into node sdk? we don't have this feature or even have separate binaries in go SDK.. not sure if this is planned though... @troyronda ^^^
</p>
<p><strong>jrosmith</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 17:17:25 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk sure that would work. i basically want to make it as easy as possible for end-users to provide me with proposals and then i can process those proposals with any sdk i wish

@jvsclp feel free to push a patch for the Windows/Cygwin makefile fix, if the CI passes, it can probably be accepted to be merged into master.. if the CI fails, then the change is probably not compatible with *nix/Mac environments.
As for the errors in the logs above, it could be that the peers urls are not being resolved in Cygwin to localhost, try to resolve them inside of /etc/hosts by adding the peers urls to the loopback address, like adding these entries to `/etc/hosts`:
```127.0.0.1	peer0.org1.example.com peer0.org2.example.com tlsca.example.com ca.org1.example.com ca.org2.example.com orderer.example.com 
127.0.0.1	peer1.org1.example.com peer1.org2.example.com```

I'm receiving this warning `[fabsdk/client] 2018/10/10 10:08:52 UTC - pgresolver.(*randomLBP).Choose -> WARN No available peer groups`
From what I understood the problem could be in my `entityMatchers` config that is like this
```yml
entityMatchers:
  peer:
    - pattern: (\w*)peer0.importerorg.trade.com(\w*)
      urlSubstitutionExp: localhost:8051
      eventUrlSubstitutionExp: localhost:8053

  certificateAuthorities:
    - pattern: (\w*)ca_peerImporterOrg(\w*)
      urlSubstitutionExp: http://localhost:8054
      mappedHost: ca_peerImporterOrg
```
I'm getting this warning in the main flow but digging into the sdk I notice that in my request options I have 
```
txnOpts: 
  channel.requestOptions
  BeforeRetry:  nil
  CCFilter: nil
  ParentContext: context.Context nil 
Retry: retry.Opts
TargetFilter:  fab.TargetFilter (*filter.EndpointFilter)

```
Where target is empty. 
Does anybody have some ideas?

Hi, I’m having the following problem after upgrading the `fabric-sdk-go`. 

In the method `ProcessTransactionProposal` in peerendorser.go, `proposalResponse, err := p.sendProposal(ctx, request)`  the proposalResponse is  `nil` and gives the error:
`err is:  cscc.GetChannels failed: SendProposal failed:  Transaction processing for endorser [localhost:7051]: Endorser Client Status Code: (2) CONNECTION_FAILED. Description: dialing connection timed out [localhost:7051]`

Both `ctx` and `request` are not nil, the latter containing the Certificate.

Anyone who can point me to the right direction?
Thanks.

Hi guys, I've a rest api, on chaincode I change the status of response before return shim
e.g
```
shimError := shim.Error(err.Error())
			errorCode, err := strconv.Atoi(result)
			if err != nil {
				return shim.Error(err.Error())
			}
			shimError.Status = int32(errorCode)
			return shimError
```

. But at fabric-sdk-go the chaincode status is always 0
```
resp, err := channelClient.Execute(invokeRequest)
			if err != nil {
				log.Printf("Put Error:\n%+v\n", resp)
				w.WriteHeader(int(resp.ChaincodeStatus)) # always 0
				w.Write([]byte(err.Error()))
				return
			}
```
how do I get status returned at pb.response?
I want to manage error codes between chaincode and rest, instead of returning always 500 for internal error
I can see in err.Error() the chaincode status that i've set in chaincode 
`err.Error() = Transaction processing for endorser [peer1.org1.example.com:8051]: Chaincode status Code: (402) UNKNOWN. Description: Person 000 already exists`, but I can't access it from response struct
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 17:16:13 GMT):<br/>
@vieiramanoel  this is normal behaviour, cc errors are set in error, not in response
</p>
<p><strong>vieiramanoel</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 17:28:11 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk then how can I manage errors with http codes between chaincode and sdk?

<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:06:40 GMT):<br/>
@vieiramanoel in the log statement you pasted above, 402 is an HTTP status code, which happens to be returned by the CC... the SDK doesn't distinguish who originated the error, it's up to the application to manage the errors the way it wants. You can categorize them by error range (ie: 500 range errors are system wise, 400 range are application wise, etc.), that's up to you.
</p>
<p><strong>vieiramanoel</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:17:56 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk But in this case I must parse string in order to get the http status code, instead I would like to get it as int32 from `resp.ChaincodeStatus` is it possible? Or I have to parse string in application always?

<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:25:05 GMT):<br/>
you may look into resp.Responses  which is an array of TransactionProposalResponse...you can iterate through it,  it has Status and ChaincodeStatus as well

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=jpptQGsXBpfZGwHWZ) @Baha-sk Thank you for the information on the error, that helped to make some progress.
After making some changes to echo variables in the `Makefile`
After line 506: `$(info abspath is $(abspath .))` to display what abspath is creating before calling Docker with `@(DOCKER_CMD)` in `.PHONY: crypto-gen`
The result is what I would expect: `abspath is /d/gowork/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go`
It seems the problem lies with MINGW trying to convert the path for docker because if I adjust the volume mount, I no longer get the source path error, but: 
```c:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Resources\bin\docker.exe: Error response from daemon: OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:348: starting container process caused "exec: \"C:/MinGW/msys/1.0/bin/bash\": stat C:/MinGW/msys/1.0/bin/bash: no such file or directory": unknown.```
I'm still working on it, but if you have any advice I'd appreciate it.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=32rZ5rfcHeekSgrd7) @vieiramanoel the error message you posted earlier is most likely coming from here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/invoke/txnhandler.go#L129
if you noticed in this line, the code sets requestContext.Error, the requestContext.Response and requestContext.Response.Responses should be unaltered... and also notice that in the peer endorser code: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/invoke/txnhandler.go#L129
the response is returned as is unless if it's a connection error (code above this line), we only extract the error code.. not sure how come your response is empty

what you can do is probably set `$(abspath .)` or the equivalent in your environment into an env variable, and use some logic to set the right value according the architecture, (ie Darwin or *nix env set the variable to `$(abspath .)`, if your env, then set the equivalent command).. abspath is a makefile function.. not sure how it's different in Cygwin/Windows

```invokeRequest := channel.Request{

I read through it which spawned a lot of other open tabs and searching and got me to where I am now. Your advice is very helpful, otherwise I feel as if I've been dropped in the wilderness without a map or compass.

I am not a developer by trade (you could probably tell by my commits), but I feel fairly proficient with Google.

Hi,

Just upgraded to the Fabric-SDK-Go v1.3 and trying to run `make` gives me these errors:

```
Running metalinters...
pkg/msp/memory_user_store.go:1::warning: file is not gofmted with -s (gofmt)

….
ake: *** [unit-test] Error 1
```

I had to “down grade from Go 1.11 to 1.10.4 — not sure whether that’s relevant.

Any ideas?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 14:29:25 GMT):<br/>
@habpygo the go formatting seems to have changed between 1.10 and 1.11
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 14:30:24 GMT):<br/>
(the SDK is currently using 1.10 gofmt)
</p>
<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 14:40:26 GMT):<br/>
Probably that's the problem, although I can't find out what version is running (gofmt -version/-v/ not working). Any idea how to downgrade to version 1.10? 
</p>
<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 14:41:41 GMT):<br/>
Just assuming that it has silently upgraded to version 1.11 after I upgraded Go to version 1.11
</p>
<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 14:41:58 GMT):<br/>
and then downgraded Go to 1.10.4 again.
</p>
<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 15:46:43 GMT):<br/>
Ok @troyronda it was that. Solved it by doing a `which gofmt` and then deleting that file. After that running `make` for the testsuite exited with code code 0
</p>
<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 15:48:09 GMT):<br/>

I've made some significant progress and I want to check in to see how I should go about putting in my bug reports. The `abspath` issue has been resolved, https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=CPB8WkCHLLCbFujG8, but it leads to a follow-up error not recognizing the bash shell to start, https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=5RZs4z6JJquEb2hPR. This issue affects every instance where `Docker run` is invoked in the makefile. 

1) Should I submit a JIRA for each seperate function call, that is, `crypto-gen`, `channel-config-gen`, etc. that has the `abspath` problem or consolidate them?
2) Similar question as (1), but for Docker not recognizing how to start /bin/bash in Linux containers?
3) Should I consolidate all the changes and push them as one unit solving the two bugs in all the functions of the makefile for fabric-sdk-go in Windows?

I'm leaning toward submitting a separate bug report for each occurrence, but what are your thoughts?

- deleted Go version 1.11 and installed 1.10.4
- did `which gofmt` and go the that directory
- deleted the `gofmt` file.

Also, anyone running from local have issues when instantiating cc? I can call InstantiateCC(with no targets) parameters and during the InstantiateCC function call, I can see my cc containers started but InstantiateCC still returns an error ``` [fabsdk/client] 2018/10/14 18:49:28 UTC - dynamicdiscovery.asPeers -> WARN Peer config not found for url [peer0.org1.example.com:7051]

It seems its able to find the peer ID to use but using the incorrect endpoint, should be using localhost instead

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=rwvWC5pHxyyQKf52i) @jvsclp for # 1, one issue is sufficient
for # 2, that's not possible, the CI runs on Linux (Ubuntu) and /bin/bash is standard (works on Mac as well).. see where your 'bash' program points to in the copy of your Docker image.. 
for # 3, you can consolidate them as they're related to your specific environment

@jvsclp for https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/27004/, have you tried `-v /$(abspath .)` and `/bin/bash` (ie not `bin/bash`)?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 19:11:07 GMT):<br/>
I'm asking because `bin/bash` seems awkward inside a Docker container...
</p>
<p><strong>jvsclp</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 19:37:46 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk Using `-v /$(abspath .)` corrects the first bug I was having from the Docker call appending `;C` to the directory passed in the `abspath` on Windows. Having `/bin/bash` as mentioned in the commit causes a follow on error unrelated to the `abspath` correction. So if I do `-v /$(abspath .)` I will still get an error from `/bin/bash`. However, I tried with two forward slashes, `//bin/bash` and that worked on Windows using Git Bash (MINGW64) which keeps the call out of the Docker container. I published a new patch with the change.
</p>
<p><strong>jvsclp</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 19:38:02 GMT):<br/>
What are the drawbacks to bin/bash versus /bin/bash?

<p><strong>jvsclp</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 19:38:02 GMT):<br/>
What are the drawbacks to bin/bash versus /bin/bash in the call to Docker for those functions mentioned in the patch commit?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 19:47:16 GMT):<br/>
@jvsclp it is odd to reference the standard /bin/bash binary as bin/bash... this assumes one must cd into / in order to access `bin/bash`
</p>
<p><strong>jvsclp</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 20:26:31 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk If `/bin/bash` is in the Docker container, I wonder why when making the call to run Docker `bin/bash` or `//bin/bash` works, but `/bin/bash` does not.
</p>
<p><strong>jvsclp</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 20:31:41 GMT):<br/>
Also, in the case of the function calls in the Makefile, does it matter if the call to the shell is `bin/bash`? It seems the `crypto-gen` and `channel-config` functions are single purpose and do not persist after a successful run to generate the necessary network artifacts.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 20:41:58 GMT):<br/>
@jvsclp to be honest, I've never seen `bin/bash` in scripts before.. it does entail someone is running it from their current directory, not from `/`
</p>
<p><strong>jvsclp</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 20:51:10 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk I guess I'm confused then. `/bin/bash` occurs in the spun up Docker container and `bin/bash` runs from the local machine spinning up the Docker container?
</p>
<p><strong>jvsclp</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 20:52:12 GMT):<br/>
It seems that `//bin/bash` also verifies in https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/27004/.
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=wxaSHFi43sqsz4tiT) @jvsclp that's not what I meant... I meant we usually never access /bin/bash binary via `bin/bash`... that's all

@baoyangc I created a patch to fix this in the z build... hopefully once merged you can rebase and see if it still fails..

Just wondering if this is expected behavior after running `make`: https://hastebin.com/uzabumayay.sql 
I'm good with all the warnings, but it's the `make: *** [unit-test] Error 1` I'm not sure about.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=AXY4p6C5ojS72KbKu) @jvsclp those metalinter warnings are actual errors, you're probably using the wrong version of gometalinter.. delete your gometalinter binary then run `make depend`, it will re install the metalinter binaries and try again..
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 22:20:01 GMT):<br/>
also fyi, sdk go doesn't support go 1.11 yet and gometalinter is linked the go version.. so make sure you're on a 1.10 version
</p>
<p><strong>jvsclp</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 22:21:37 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk Thanks, I'm using go v1.10.3. I'll give your suggestion a shot.

Hi,

I have some questions about the Fabric-go sdk's maturity and development plan that I have not been able to find any information on:
* I see that the project is in Alpha 4, is there a ballpark ETA for a Beta or RC?
* At what point can we expect API's to settle?
* Which version of the Fabric project can we expect the go-sdk to be fully released alongside?
* Which are the most pressing issues in the tracker?
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=RhejuqZQrcygbSoNR) @vieiramanoel so basically you need to mock the result coming from this line: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/fab/peer/peerendorser.go#L105
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 20:14:54 GMT):<br/>
if you go to the sendProposal() call... you will see that it calls `conn, err := p.conn(ctx)` which returns a grpc clientContext... if you go to conn() function, you notice that it gets a fab.commManager instance through the call `commManager, ok := context.RequestCommManager(ctx)`
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 20:15:10 GMT):<br/>
commManager is what you want to mock here...
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 20:18:11 GMT):<br/>
look at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/fab/peer/peer.go#L233 for how you can create an example mockCommManager... 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 20:18:11 GMT):<br/>
look at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/fab/comm/mocks.go#L19 for how you can create an example mockCommManager... 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 20:21:31 GMT):<br/>
then make sure to add the instance of the mockCommManager in your ctx passed in to processProposal
</p>
<p><strong>vieiramanoel</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 20:21:56 GMT):<br/>
so mocking commManager I can emulate sendProposal result, right?
</p>
<p><strong>vieiramanoel</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 20:22:01 GMT):<br/>
I'll work on this
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 20:22:38 GMT):<br/>
not all of sendProposal.. just the outside call inside of sendProposal.. 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 20:22:49 GMT):<br/>
good luck..
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 20:59:53 GMT):<br/>
@vieiramanoel I was thinking... probably you don't need to mock CommManager... 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 21:00:48 GMT):<br/>
all you need is a MockEndorserServer... and leave processProposal do an external grpc call where the MockEndorserServer will catch it and simulate an error ...
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 21:02:37 GMT):<br/>
actually this is exactly what TestProcessProposalGoodDial() does..
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 21:02:40 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/fab/peer/peerendorser_test.go#L194 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 21:04:55 GMT):<br/>
then you can return whatever you like from this mockEndorserServer
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 21:05:33 GMT):<br/>
this is an example of proposalError, I think this is what you want to return.. https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/fab/peer/peerendorser_test.go#L208 @vieiramanoel

Chaincode Invoke sends the transaction to the orderer. Is there a way to force the query to do the same?

Hello everyone. Noob here, trying to migrate some of my sample code from HLF 1.1 to 1.2, and I am having problems with locating peer endpoints. The old `InstantiateCC()` worked fine without `resmgt.WithPeers()` but it doesn't seem to work against 1.2. I see that the sample-cli code calls` WithPeers()` but it goes through quite a bit of trouble to compose a peer list based on `EndpointConfig()`. Is all of that rigamarole strictly required? If so, is there already equivalent code actually in the sdk so i don't have to copy/paste or ref the fabric-cli sample?

@nyet this example of the integration test does not use `WithPeers()`: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/base_test_setup.go#L314 ... make sure your peers (at least anchor peer for each org) are defined in your config.yaml as in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/config/config_e2e.yaml#L332

@baha-sk they are

note that in the debug log, we see `EventSource:false`

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 18:51:17 GMT):<br/>
ah it looks like it has to be in the channels->(org)->peers section, even though the comment says it is optoinal:
```
        # [Optional]. will this peer be the target of the SDK's listener registration? All peers can
        # produce events but the app typically only needs to connect to one to listen to events.
        # Default: true
        eventSource: true
```
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:39:41 GMT):<br/>
@nyet, eventSource being `[Optional]` means it doesn't need to be specified for all the channel peers (if the client doesn't need to listen to events from all peers).. did it work?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:40:16 GMT):<br/>
yes. I should have said the note about "default: true:" is wrong
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:41:23 GMT):<br/>
also `channels/peers` must match the `peers` list
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:41:31 GMT):<br/>
oh I see
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:42:01 GMT):<br/>
yeah.. I guess the comment can be changed if that's the case
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:42:18 GMT):<br/>
Now, I am trying to do the same thing with `SaveChannelRequest()` and `JoinChannel()` (without `WithOrdererEndpoint`).. but that doesn't seem to work either. Is `WithOrdererEndpoint()` also required or can the orderer be determined from `config.yaml`?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:43:19 GMT):<br/>
you don't need to use `WithOrdererEndpoint` or `WithOrdererEndpoint()` if they're all set in `config.yaml`
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:44:03 GMT):<br/>
you said you were using `entitymatchers` ?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:44:07 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:44:53 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:45:38 GMT):<br/>
its stripped down because I am building templates so it is missing all the comments. i only want to include what the bare minimum is
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:46:32 GMT):<br/>
eqtitymatchers are useful if you want to map peers urls with different dns names than the ones defined under peer generally

(for this POC)
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:49:06 GMT):<br/>
actually fyi https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/config/config_e2e.yaml is the bare minimum (you can even remove certificateAuthorities section if you don't want to interact with Fabric CA).. Normally you don't need entityMatchers also..
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:49:15 GMT):<br/>
looking into your config.. 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:53:00 GMT):<br/>
can you comment out `entityMatchers` in the config and add these addresses to your /etc/hostsfile: `127.0.0.1      peer0.org1.hf.blockdaemon.io peer1.org1.hf.blockdaemon.io orderer0.hf.blockdaemon.io`
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:53:17 GMT):<br/>
i'mi assuming you're running all your network locally, right?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:53:27 GMT):<br/>
its on a vm somehwere
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:53:38 GMT):<br/>
i'd have to set up ports etc
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:53:48 GMT):<br/>
but on localhost?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:53:51 GMT):<br/>
eerr just set them in `config.yaml`
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:54:18 GMT):<br/>
usually your docker-compose.yaml  will set the ports for you..
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:54:21 GMT):<br/>
no i mean
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:54:30 GMT):<br/>
i have to put the ports in `config.yaml`
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:56:00 GMT):<br/>
if you notice the sdk config e2e example, the peers/orderers have the url set in them... https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/config/config_e2e.yaml#L335 is this what you mean?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:56:31 GMT):<br/>
yes id' have to set the ports via the rul
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:56:31 GMT):<br/>
yes id' have to set the ports via the url. Mine do not becausei use matcher
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:57:28 GMT):<br/>
yes, that's fine.. but your `entityMatcher` section entails your peers/orderer are running locally on your machine

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 20:11:01 GMT):<br/>
how do i specify an orderer to use in Matchers
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 20:11:59 GMT):<br/>
you don't need to use matchers if you have specified the url under the `orderers`
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 20:12:51 GMT):<br/>
and you should not be specifying this section in the config: channels:/<channel>:/orderers
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 20:12:51 GMT):<br/>
specifying the url in orderers does nothing
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 20:14:27 GMT):<br/>
Matching just remaps the specified orderer. The one in `orderers:` does nothing. the one in `channels:/<channel>:/orderers:` works but i'm not supposed to use it
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 20:15:17 GMT):<br/>
orderer matcher is commented out here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/config/config_e2e.yaml#L477
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 20:16:02 GMT):<br/>
you can try to add one and try ..
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 20:16:43 GMT):<br/>
yea nothing works unless I specify one in channels, or via WithOrdererEndpoint()

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 20:20:22 GMT):<br/>
Yea i think you HAVE to specify orderer
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 20:20:27 GMT):<br/>
the client can't know
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 20:20:34 GMT):<br/>
so it's fine, just pass it when saving the channel
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 20:21:31 GMT):<br/>
yea no big deal was hoping to avoid having to have it in code, was hoping to be able to specify it in config.yaml but i can see that if the channel doesn't exist yet, the client can't know what orderer to use yet
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 20:23:07 GMT):<br/>
that's right

@Baha-sk I tried a few different approaches to resolve the errors when running `make` in Windows with no success. I'm still getting the long list of errors: https://hastebin.com/ozadikejuc.sql

1) I deleted the `gometalinter.exe` in my `gowork/bin` directory and the `gowork/src/github.com/alecthomas` which made the `make depend` script run without error. It only seems to cause the `_linters/honnef.co': No such file or directory` error when the binary and the directory for the gometalinter both exist.
2) I ran `make` with both the latest release, `v2.0.11` of gometalinter and the `v2` which is the default in the `dependencies.sh`
3) I also upgraded from go v1.10.3 to v1.10.4, then tried the above step with no success.

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 26 Oct 2018 15:23:51 GMT):<br/>
@tinywell I had this problem as well with two peers. Sometimes the client would connect to different peers for the tx and one for the event, unless you specifically use `resmgt.WithPeers(...)` to override the peers specified in `config.yaml`. In the case where they are different, the event is greatly delayed. However, if one peer is not reachable, it should try others.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 26 Oct 2018 15:26:08 GMT):<br/>
Which brings us to another point; is there a way to figure out which peer a tx used so it can be forcibly preferred when using eventservice for TxStatus?

@jvsclp The comment says you removed leading slashes, but now there are double? I don't see why double forward slashes are necessary, they aren't escaped anywhere in mingw64 make as far as i know
</p>
<p><strong>jvsclp</strong> (Fri, 26 Oct 2018 17:14:32 GMT):<br/>
@nyet I originally removed the leading slashes, correct. That made running `bin/bash` work on Windows 10 using mingw64, otherwise with `/bin/bash` mingw attempts to convert '/bin/bash' to 'C:/MinGW/msys/1.0/bin/bash` which is not found in the docker container (see http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Posix_path_conversion). However, there was some consternation of running `bin/bash` versus `/bin/bash` and rightfully so. I found in the release notes of Known Issues with Git for Windows that using a double slash `//bin/bash` is an acceptable alternative which will avoid the path conversion (https://github.com/git-for-windows/build-extra/blob/master/ReleaseNotes.md). Running the double slash `//bin/bash` works on Windows 10 using mingw64.

but there are no defaults for `chPeerCfg` that I can find

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 22:56:47 GMT):<br/>
Oh. I see that `peerChannelConfigHookFunc()` initializes them but all lower case.

<p><strong>ranjan008</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 10:29:38 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda  is there any method where I can directly query Block with private data from the peers instead of querying it through chaincode, just like we are querying block data directly through peer.

@nyet the lookups are using viper behind the scenes... so all keys are automatically converted to lowercase by the tool, this is why it's failing.. I suggest we keep lowercase keys

try to increase the timeout when querying the peers maybe?

Hello! i'm trying the sdk with head at 614551a752802488988921a730b172dada7def1d and the make command fails! 
I have a lot of output but the most relevant message is i suppose : 
Failed to get client TLS config: Certificate provided has expired
Does anyone know how to bypass this as i don't want to change the commit i'm using?
Thank you in advance!

<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:54:45 GMT):<br/>
@noursaadallah a lot has changed since this commit (including support for Fabric 1.3) you might wanna update to the latest revision
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:55:38 GMT):<br/>
@noursaadallah another option is regenerate the crypto-gen directory locally..
</p>
<p><strong>noursaadallah</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 18:06:07 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk  thank you for your answer!  and how can i regenerate the crypto-gen directory please?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 18:11:05 GMT):<br/>
it's a command under Fabric.. look it up in the Fabric's makefile to generate the tool, then you can run it for the crypto-gen folder that holds your users credentials

Hey guys,

When querying CouchDB using the stub.QueryResultWithPagination method, is there a way to get how many pages there are in total?

Also, is there a way to ask for a specific page instead of iterating with bookmarks? I feel like this is not very efficient...
</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 18:18:22 GMT):<br/>
sorry, there is no such support in leveldb or couchdb to efficiently get that information
</p>
<p><strong>bandreghetti</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 18:41:29 GMT):<br/>
Oh, thank you then "/

But will it be implemented eventually?

<p><strong>JaccobSmith</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 02:16:22 GMT):<br/>
when I use the sdk to invoke a chaincode ,the orderer node produced an error:  
received bogusgreeting from client: \"\\x16.....................
</p>
<p><strong>JaccobSmith</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 02:21:15 GMT):<br/>
Oh, I found it, it's because of my config, I use the "127.0.0.1:7050" as the orderer's url, then I didn't change the config item "allow-insecure" to true
</p>
<p><strong>JaccobSmith</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 02:21:51 GMT):<br/>
Or ,I can add a "http://" to the front of the orderer's url
</p>
<p><strong>JaccobSmith</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 02:27:24 GMT):<br/>
Another question , when the endorsering process is successful,but the orderer fails committing the block , Is there some way to judge this with the SDK?       Actually, when I use the SDK to send the proposal to the peer and get the endorsered results ,the SDK seems to send the results to the orderer without waitting the reeponse of the orderer

Hi, can anybody tell me how the SDK internally correlates an incoming endorsement with the associated TX proposal? I know where to find the transaction ID of the proposal and the proposal hash in the proposal response, but that's not the same. Any pointers?
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 15:27:58 GMT):<br/>
I use the sdk with `fabsdk.WithEndpointConfig` and `fabsdk.WithIdentityConfig`. However, the function signatures change from time to time and when I update the sdk, I would like to type check my functions. Is there a way to check if my functions still match the signatures? interfaces like the following are all private ```type peerConfig interface {
	PeerConfig(nameOrURL string) (*fab.PeerConfig, bool)
}```
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 15:59:02 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=KeX8JRoG22RAvmZyy) @Kyroy peerConfig is not a reference interface, this is why it's not exposed. The reference interface is the original one in pkg/common/providers/fab.providers.go : ```//EndpointConfig contains endpoint network configurations
type EndpointConfig interface {
	Timeout(TimeoutType) time.Duration
	OrderersConfig() []OrdererConfig
	OrdererConfig(nameOrURL string) (*OrdererConfig, bool)
	PeersConfig(org string) ([]PeerConfig, bool)
	PeerConfig(nameOrURL string) (*PeerConfig, bool)
	NetworkConfig() *NetworkConfig
	NetworkPeers() []NetworkPeer
	ChannelConfig(name string) *ChannelEndpointConfig
	ChannelPeers(name string) []ChannelPeer
	ChannelOrderers(name string) []OrdererConfig
	TLSCACertPool() CertPool
	TLSClientCerts() []tls.Certificate
	CryptoConfigPath() string
}```
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 16:00:15 GMT):<br/>
@Kyroy so your overridable config functions must match this official interface's functions instead

<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 16:55:56 GMT):<br/>
not sure if it's an SDK issue or a Fabric issue to be honest

<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 16:56:35 GMT):<br/>
you can confirm if the config is similar to the ones we have in the go sdk's integration tests

under /test/fixtures/config

err examples
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 16:58:13 GMT):<br/>
it's probably not using the same config as the go SDK one.. they're not the same
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 16:59:04 GMT):<br/>
It would be helpful if there were more defaults, or there was a top level way to adjust things

@baha-sk i have tracked the problem down to something in fabric where it is missing the channelID in the nofication path... but I cannot figure out why the channel id went missing between instantiate and the notify... it looks like I will have to actually do my own build of the peer binary to get some debugging ... any recommendations?

</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 12:34:25 GMT):<br/>
@oreg  @Taaanos then signingmgr.go calls the Sign of the CryptoProvider.. which default implementation is: fabric-sdk-go/pkg/core/cryptosuite/bccsp/wrapper/cryptosuiteimpl.go and from there the rabbit hole ends with Fabric's sw or PKCS11 implementations .. in the default you have another call to either ecdsa signing or rsa signing, look at fabric-sdk-go/internal/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bccsp/sw package for more details (ecdsa.go and rsa.go)

What I do now is add a test struct `otherFcns` that implements the rest of the functions, embedd my `MyImpl` struct and do ```var _ fab.EndpointConfig = (*otherFcns)(nil)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=BGtecNx4LGHgX96GG) @Kyroy Actually this is the reason these single interfaces should not to be exposed. We don't want to enforce single interfaces for each function, the purpose of overriding the functions is for users to create an interface with their own combination of functions (which is exactly what you are doing with the `xxx` interface). You do not need to implement all the functions.
Even though this test implements each function separately then assembles a complete EndpointConfigOptions instance: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/fab/opts_test.go#L49 you can also implement multiple functions in 1 interface and pass that interface to BuildConfigEndpointFromOptions() (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/fab/opts.go#L107) which will build a complete EndpointConfig interface which you can pass to `pkg.context.WithEndpointConfig()`. In fact, the exposed functions in `pkg/fab/opts.go` are utility functions to help users build a final EndpointConfig instance that you can pass to `WithEndpointConfig`:
1. `UpdateMissingOptsWithDefaultConfig`: will fill in functions not implemented by the user (interface of first argument), with default EndpointConfig implementation (second argument)
2. `IsEndpointConfigFullyOverridden`: will return true if all functions were implemented in the user's custom interface (argument passed), false otherwise.
3. `BuildConfigEndpointFromOptions`: build a final EndpointConfig to be used by the SDK with the user interface implementing one (or more) function(s) of EndpointConfig.

Are you saying the SDK opens a connection to each endorsing node that it shuts down only once the response has arrived on that same connection? That would be useful. Could you point me to the SDK code that handle this connection?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=DFtRPJmNFmsnqvupe) @Baha-sk When I define my own interface that I implement, the typechecker will not see when the interface `fab.EndpointConfig` was changed in the SDK. The program still runs and just uses the default implementations by the sdk.

However, my solution covers this. So I am ok with it

Hello all ,has anyone faced with this  issue?
`go build`
```
# github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/vendor/github.com/google/certificate-transparency-go/x509
..\github.com\cloudflare\cfssl\vendor\github.com\google\certificate-transparency-go\x509\root_windows.go:112:3: cannot use uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(sslPara)) (type uintptr) as type syscall.Pointer in field value
``` 
it looks like this is a problem of go 1.11 compiler , I found that issue was fixed in cloudfare/cfssl in the new package version
but fabric-go-sdk is linked to 1.3.1

however i get this issue 
</p>
<p><strong>adamhardie</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 15:16:41 GMT):<br/>
can't load package: package github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/lib/cid: cannot find package "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/lib/cid" in any of:

<p><strong>Taaanos</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 15:27:45 GMT):<br/>
go get -u github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/lib/cid 
should install the package at $GOPATH
</p>
<p><strong>Taaanos</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 15:28:04 GMT):<br/>
have you set up go's env vars?

Hi Experts
Anyone could suggest me good tutorial or documentation link of the #fabric-sdk-go ?
I’m trying to learn how an own  REST API build in go could interact with the peer using #fabric-ds-go.

</p>
<p><strong>Taaanos</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 15:41:31 GMT):<br/>
@Mr.Reddington fabric is built using gRPC. There are REST options as well.

<p><strong>Taaanos</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 15:42:38 GMT):<br/>
There is no official documentation yet for fabric-sdk-go, like fabric-sdk-node for example
</p>
<p><strong>adamhardie</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 15:42:47 GMT):<br/>
hm, i can see 
github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/lib/cid
is in "go list ... "
</p>
<p><strong>adamhardie</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 15:44:14 GMT):<br/>
i think i may have installed it stragely as i check 
cd $GOPATH 
go list
</p>
<p><strong>adamhardie</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 15:44:33 GMT):<br/>
and it says "no go files in xxx/x" 
</p>
<p><strong>Taaanos</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 15:44:55 GMT):<br/>
@adamhardie what are you trying to do? FYI if you cloned a repo there is probably a Gopkg.lock and Gopkg.toml, if yes you can use dep to handle the dependencies 
</p>
<p><strong>Taaanos</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 15:45:14 GMT):<br/>
what does echo $GOPATH prints?

just install the package for cli

<p><strong>adamhardie</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 15:45:46 GMT):<br/>
gopath prints /opt/go

i have added packages before but a while ago, i will keep trying

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=TNS2Csvux3KhxiS2W) @Taaanos shim package is to be used inside the cc to respond to requests and operate with the peer/ledger, the SDK's job is to query a fabric network as an admin (ie Create Channel, Install CC, etc.) or as a user (invoke/Query CC, listen to CC events, etc.) there are different client packages to allow this, for instance the `resmgmt` is a client that allows to manage/query fabric resources (like CCs and Channels), look at the tests under /integration/e2e/pkg/resmgmt for examples, or the channel client to execute/query transactions on the channel, see integration/pkg/client/channel for examples... if you want a broader full end to end examples, then integration/e2e/end_to_end.go shows full examples of creating channels and CCs and invoking them via the client.

 @Baha-sk im getting closer to figuring out what is wrong with cc instantation; long story short: there are situations where when calling cc, the peer generates an event with no channelid, and Notify() fails to pass the error along to the peer via event.

</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 16:46:17 GMT):<br/>
The result is a timeout, rather than the client seeing the error message from the peer when it is waiting for the TxEvent for the instantiation txid. I searched in Jira but I do not see a bug for it...
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 16:49:22 GMT):<br/>
You can test this by making the Init() shim in a CC always return shim.Error()
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 16:53:50 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=XK3Ze5j2fbcfoC2XZ) @nyet I believe you need to have a channel first, look at `createChannelAndCC` in test/integration/e2e/end_to_end.go.. the test first creates a resmgmt client and joins a channel, then does the installCC and instantiateCC with that resmgmt client
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 16:54:07 GMT):<br/>
ya i did all of that
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 16:54:41 GMT):<br/>
and you specified the orderer endpoint in JoinChannel?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 16:54:58 GMT):<br/>
yea, create, join, install all work
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 16:56:10 GMT):<br/>
the interesting thing is, in all cases, channelid is missing in the Notify()
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 16:56:18 GMT):<br/>
but only instantiate doesn't like it
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 16:56:39 GMT):<br/>
usually timeout is a sign of a bad credential during connection..
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 16:56:54 GMT):<br/>
Yep, that doesn't seem to be the case here
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 16:57:11 GMT):<br/>
are you using resMgmt.InstantiateCC() call?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 16:58:02 GMT):<br/>
whoa wierd this time the notify got channelid but the client STILL didn't see the error
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 16:58:04 GMT):<br/>
ya
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 16:58:28 GMT):<br/>
Is it strictkly legal to call instantiate with no args?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 16:58:35 GMT):<br/>
(the shim)
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 16:59:21 GMT):<br/>
wait no it got the error this time
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 16:59:26 GMT):<br/>
no.. you need to pass in the channelID, resmgmt.InstantiateCCRequest and (if you have options) you can pass in the opts as last argument
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 16:59:42 GMT):<br/>
hold lemme check my code real quick and i can tell you
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 16:59:54 GMT):<br/>
channel is there but no optional args
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 16:59:56 GMT):<br/>
the shim is used inside the cc, not the client
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 16:59:59 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:00:01 GMT):<br/>
i understand
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:00:25 GMT):<br/>
the issue that is in some cases, if the shim returns an error from the cc, the peer generates an event with no channelid
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:00:47 GMT):<br/>
and the client never sees the error
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:00:57 GMT):<br/>
you also need an instance of resmgmt.InstantiateCCRequest to specify the cc name, path, version, policy and args
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:01:26 GMT):<br/>
are you sure the channel is created?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:01:29 GMT):<br/>
yep
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:01:47 GMT):<br/>
if not, restart your network and make sure create and join channel are executed..
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:01:52 GMT):<br/>
yep they are for sure

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:02:59 GMT):<br/>
just wondering if that sounded familiar to you
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:03:08 GMT):<br/>
im getting closer to narrowing it down to something in my code
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:04:39 GMT):<br/>
if you want, try to add the option WithRetry() call so that it tries multiple times..
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:05:24 GMT):<br/>
`resmgmt.WithRetry(retry.DefaultResMgmtOpts)` in createCC under test/integration/e2e/end_to_end.go
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:05:58 GMT):<br/>
`retry.DefaultResMgmtOpts` is specific to the tests, but you can create your own copy
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:15:20 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk I have fixed my end by having `Init()` allow an empty function from `GetFunctionAndParameters()`, but the results are still cryptic (sometimes) if `Init()` returns an error. Not sure why, it isn't a consistent behavior. If i get something consistently reproducible I will open a bug. Until them I'm moving on.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:19:57 GMT):<br/>
out of curiosity, why does `Init()` returns shim.Error()? if the CC is not doing any special initialization operations just return shim.Success(), no?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:20:07 GMT):<br/>
Yes, it was my mistake
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:20:17 GMT):<br/>
i was having it look for `function == "init"`
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:20:40 GMT):<br/>
(since my instantiation used to call it with "init")
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:21:25 GMT):<br/>
you don't need to have init as part of the invocation list, it is used by the peer to start the CC only
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:21:34 GMT):<br/>
I am not sure why, I don't recall every doing that but something changed recently.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:21:56 GMT):<br/>
your functions should be the ones needed when Invoke is called
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:22:32 GMT):<br/>
Understood, not sure why Init() was looking for `"init"`. I may have erroneously copied it from somewhere. What is confusing is why it was working before.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:22:49 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:25:14 GMT):<br/>
oh wait

</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 17:25:25 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 20:30:34 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk I think this related to the problem I was seeing
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FABG-775
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 20:41:02 GMT):<br/>
yes, @vieiramanoel was working on this and even pushed a patch for this, but the error codes returned by the CC are indirectly managed in the SDK, so it's not that straight forward to expose these error codes as the SDK generates Status instances with a specific code once the response is received
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 20:43:45 GMT):<br/>
for now, your cc should return shim.Error("...some error msg here...") and the SDK will expect error 500 (the string in shim.Error(..)) matches some specific strings, then the SDK will set a proper error code and return it back to you
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 20:57:15 GMT):<br/>
@nyet @vieiramanoel have a look at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/fab/peer/peerendorser.go#L228 to see how the CC errors are extracted into `status` error
</p>
<p><strong>vieiramanoel</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 21:12:59 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk always getting 500 for cc error is awful, I'm not happy in matching error strings too, makes it not generic and for each chaincode I need to specifically implement a different rest-server
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 21:46:09 GMT):<br/>
@vieiramanoel absolutely feel the same
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 21:46:55 GMT):<br/>
even the most basic error recovery/retry exception handling is basically impossible w/o a bunch of string matching
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 21:47:04 GMT):<br/>
which is, by nature, extremely fragile
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 21:50:39 GMT):<br/>
you can return `pb.Response{Status: "1234", Message: fmt.Sprintf("Failed to set value for key[%s] : %s", key, err)}` in the cc, but it needs to be handled properly in the sdk
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 21:50:39 GMT):<br/>
you can return `pb.Response{Status: "1234", Message: fmt.Sprintf("Failed to set value for key[%s] : %s", key, err)}` in the cc as an example, but it needs to be handled properly in the sdk
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 21:52:07 GMT):<br/>
ah so just avoid Error() unless it really is a crazy error
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 21:52:20 GMT):<br/>
yea
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 21:52:23 GMT):<br/>
ok I see.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 21:53:14 GMT):<br/>
the available codes in the SDK are here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/common/errors/status/codes.go#L22, these codes don't have 1:1 mapping with returned pb.Response in the CC as we can't control what the CC return
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 21:53:45 GMT):<br/>
shim.Error() resolves to http 500 error
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 21:59:14 GMT):<br/>
thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 22:00:07 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk what about this example:
```
        resp, err := setup.resClient.InstantiateCC(setup.ChannelID, req)
        if err != nil || resp.TransactionID == "" {
                // Seriously, hyperledger?
                if strings.Contains(err.Error(), "chaincode exists "+setup.ChainCodeID) {
                        fmt.Println("Chaincode already instantiated on channel "+setup.ChannelID)
                        return nil
                }
                if strings.Contains(err.Error(), "chaincode with name '"+setup.ChainCodeID+"' already exists") {
                        fmt.Println("Chaincode already instantiated on channel "+setup.ChannelID)
                        return nil
                }
                return errors.WithMessage(err, "failed to instantiate the chaincode on channel "+setup.ChannelID)
        }
```
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 22:00:28 GMT):<br/>
like i think the only way to detect this is to query the channel to see if it is already there?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 22:00:34 GMT):<br/>
(before calling instantiate)
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 22:06:33 GMT):<br/>
yes you can, usually the install and instantiate CC calls are done by an admin app.. and the user app does CC invocations and tx executions..
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 22:07:13 GMT):<br/>
you can do a CC query to check if the CC is already installed prior to do instantiateCC
</p>

Channel based on channel.tx which has all applications that can participate based on profile TwoOrgsChannel
and we see to restrict peers from joining a channel based on channel channel.tx created on orderer i.e., channel.block which is used to join channel

Why do we have to join all peers to the channel explicitly when channel.tx and channel.block already has information and peers are already connected?

So, looks like genesis block is created only once with all orgs on system channel

Application Channel are created per channel based on channel.tx that also has all application orgs that can participate based on a profile TwoOrgsChannel
and we seem to restrict peers from joining any channel created based on channel channel.tx created on orderer that gives you channel.block which is probably also based on genesis.block restriction on orderer (which orgs can participate?) is used by peers to join channel

Q) Why do we have to join all peers to the channel explicitly when channel.tx and channel.block already has information about orgs and peers for each org are already connected?
Q) What is the purpose of anchor peer transactions again per peer on orderer after joining the channel?

Each org has a few peers, genesis block has all orgs, orderer info - based on configs
Channel (.tx) has subset of orgs - based on configs
Why would we restrict specific peers in same org like this?

no, it's not. I also just recently learned this. This is why I am looking for this feature in the sdk
- The creator of the instantiation transaction of the chaincode on a channel is validated against the instantiation policy of the chaincode.
- specifies the set of peers on a channel that must execute chaincode and endorse the execution results

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=Z6DEGBLoEczh2otE3) @Kyroy but why is it called `instantiation` policy if you want this available on `install` ?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=4c4y4EquLwQDg5wHn) @nyet my 2 cents are the tests run quicker than the peer/cc containers which is causing the test to query before the fabric network is updated, which is causing different failures at different runs, I'm trying to add retries where these failures occur
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:40:47 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk I also don't know why it was designed like this (on `install`). It is called `instantiation policy` because it defines who is allowed to instantiate the chaincode. And later who is allowed to upgrade (if I got it correctly). 
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:40:47 GMT):<br/>
What I was looking for is how to prevent a random party from upgrading a chaincode to a malicious version. e.g. to read private information from private collections, etc...
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:43:09 GMT):<br/>

IIRC you must have install privileges to upgrade chaincode (it is the same action as install).

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:48:52 GMT):<br/>
Update/upgrade is just install with a different version number.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=mQgs3aW5DNkKk69A3) @nyet Scenario: multiple orgs on a channel, let's say org1, org2, org3, ...
All of them are "equal", so they have the same rights. Let's assume all policies are MAJORITY
If you have a chaincode where, e.g. there exists a private-collection from org1 and org2, they can implement a function to get some special documents also for org3 (by querying peer from org1/org2). So they implemented an access control.

But when you do not set the instantiation policy, org3 could install a new version of this cc, and just upgrade the chaincode.
this means that
a) org3 can remove current features from the CC and make a DoS for the chaincode
b) org3 can remove the access control and access all documents in the private collection by querying the peers from org1/org2

At least this is how I understood `instantiation policies`.
When I stated this problem in the #fabric chat, I was forwarded to the instantiation policy.

And my question is, why not updating this struct to the interface
a) you use native structs of fabric and dont define own structs that differ
b) by using native structs, you dont miss any features
c) users that know fabric constructs can just use them

I get that right now the sdk has its own stuff

It was just a proposal to use the interface in the struct instead of re-defining the struct in the sdk.

The trying to query only just messes up everything... NodeJS workd like a charm... query enroling admin I have done all of that... But GO docs and examples are too involved to many moving parts.. Like example this is how you query bam done next file this is how you invoke bam done... not linking all of the shit in one... makes it very difficult to read and work through... Just some back ground I am a masters student in software engineering so not a complete idiot... Just Its easier to read your own code than trying to read very involved code like entering a job and there give you 500000 lines of code to get familiar with it..

@Switch2Logic  Try this https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/e2e/end_to_end.go#L83

You have to create new sdk instance using config, something lie
'sdk  = fabsdk.New(config.FromFile(<YOURCONFIGFILE>)'

Then create Channel client using channel id and user (as given in that test)
You don't need retry opts or target endpoints for simple straightforward test client.Query()
` client.Query(channel.Request{.......})` is enough

I'm trying to do a back to back channel create with an anchor-peers update. Is `WaitForOrdererConfigUpdate()` still needed? The comment in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/base_test_setup.go says
```// WaitForOrdererConfigUpdate waits until the config block update has been committed.
// In Fabric 1.0 there is a bug that panics the orderer if more than one config update is added to the same block.
// This function may be invoked after each config update as a workaround.```

@Switch2Logic Looks like a simple connectivity problem. Can you ping the peer from the client? Can the order see the peer?

in the peer `CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/var/hyperledger/msp`

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 17:26:20 GMT):<br/>
but in docker:
```    volumes:

```
According to this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51398420/hyperledger-fabric-msp-directory-to-be-used-while-defining-docker-compose
`CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH` should be `users/Admin@org1.example.com/msp`, not `peers/..../msp`
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 17:29:46 GMT):<br/>
do i need something like `      - ./crypto-config/peerOrganizations/org1.${DOMAIN}/users/Admin@org1.${DOMAIN}/msp:/var/hyperledger/admin_msp` for the "peer" command to work inside that container?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 17:42:03 GMT):<br/>
I guess the answer is, the peer running in the container as a real peer uses the peer msp, but when running the peer command as a client needs the admin msp?

@nyet there's no need to change docker compose as this `/var/hyperledger/msp` is a mounted volume to whatever path you specified in docker-compose file.. make sure the volume mounting is done properly (you can log in to the container and double check if `/var/hyperledger/msp` is properly mapped

I am just saying that `peer node status` is worthless
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 21:23:30 GMT):<br/>
the peer can have cancer and still say it is fine
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 21:23:32 GMT):<br/>
what about other peer node commands?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 21:23:41 GMT):<br/>
use https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discovery-cli.html 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 21:23:47 GMT):<br/>
on a single peer
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 21:23:48 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 21:23:54 GMT):<br/>
and it gives you the list of all the other peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 21:24:01 GMT):<br/>
it's much better than asking all the peers
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 21:24:04 GMT):<br/>
got it
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 21:24:05 GMT):<br/>
thanks
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 21:24:12 GMT):<br/>
now, in v1.4 we will have metrics support
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 21:24:21 GMT):<br/>
so the peer will be able to send via udp, all kinds of information
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 21:24:28 GMT):<br/>
way too much information if you ask me ;) 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 21:24:38 GMT):<br/>
and also the peer will have an endpoint `/healthz`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 21:24:42 GMT):<br/>
that you could `curl` 
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 21:27:25 GMT):<br/>
so all the rest of the peer commands seem to work it was only `peer node status` that had cert issues 
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 21:27:30 GMT):<br/>
understood

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=taT2EubgwQoxWYQjE) @Baha-sk thank you for your answer. I am using go 1.10.4 but how can I find the correct gometalinter?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 14:41:13 GMT):<br/>
you can run `which gometalinter` where it's installed ... 
</p>
<p><strong>Taaanos</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 14:42:22 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk Plus, are we talking about master branch?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=nCXjfrr7zeKZFHzot) @Baha-sk I have `gometalinter` at the correct path `go/bin/gometalinter`
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 14:43:30 GMT):<br/>
yes, no master branch in go sdk... you can probably delete the binary then run `make depend` to reinstall it
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 14:43:30 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 14:45:07 GMT):<br/>
unfortunately when printing the version of gometalinter (`gometalinter --version`) it just says: `gometalinter version master built from ? on ` 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 14:45:55 GMT):<br/>
it's because the install script builds it from GitHub..

@Taaanos, also the metalinter binaries are not installed in `fabric-sdk-go`, they're installed in your GOAPTH's bin folder usually

<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 14:44:12 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 15:24:44 GMT):<br/>
not sure why it doesn't work for you @Taaanos , I guess you can wait for go 1.11 support, for now you can disable the linters in the `unit-test` target by setting `TEST_WITH_LINTER=false` in the makefile.. but it doesn't guarantee linting code you introduce/change in the sdk
</p>
<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 15:32:37 GMT):<br/>
Hi @Taaanos,

Just to make 100% sure, I got these type of problems when upgrading to go version 1.11 and I had to downgrade to 1.10.4 again. However, after downgrading there remained some funnies.

If you run `go version`, do you get 1.10.4? 
Running `which go` do you get the right path? On my Mac I get usr/local/go/bin 
Running `which gofmt` I get /usr/local/go/bin/gofmt. I remember that I had to delete gofmt in the wrong path.
</p>
<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 15:33:22 GMT):<br/>
Just check where 1.10.4 should reside and gofmt as well.
</p>
<p><strong>Taaanos</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 15:35:31 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 15:38:21 GMT):<br/>
@Taaanos it's possible another tool installed gofmt for you.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 15:39:10 GMT):<br/>
I assume you have tried to delete gofmt and then run make depend and then run make all in one sequence?

<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 16:16:14 GMT):<br/>
I am not sure what to do with the override. I had them in the config file, deleted them, then put it back again. 
</p>
<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 16:17:36 GMT):<br/>
@tanos one more try. You have your go paths configured correctly?
</p>
<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 16:18:15 GMT):<br/>
`source data must be an array or slice, got map` error pops up when you override config backend with unexpected strut types and config fails to resolve it
</p>
<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 16:19:32 GMT):<br/>
Not sure what you mean. Can you point me to a correct example in the sdk?

<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 16:21:16 GMT):<br/>
@Taaanos Did you correct the GOPATH and Root in the .bashrc or .profile files? 
</p>
<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 16:22:37 GMT):<br/>
@habpygo here is the sample for overriding channels in config programmatically
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/e2e/orgs/multi_orgs_ch_update_signatures_test.go#L317
</p>
<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 16:23:01 GMT):<br/>
similarly you can override other config elements
</p>
<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 16:23:31 GMT):<br/>
OK thanks @sudeshrshetty , I will try that out. 
</p>
<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 16:24:03 GMT):<br/>
@habpygo just curious, which config element you are trying to override? Why don't you directly change config file?
</p>
<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 16:26:58 GMT):<br/>
@sudeshrshetty I'm not trying to override anything really. As I said I commented the overide from the config.yaml file out and tried without succes; then I put it in a separate file `local_entity_matchers,yaml` with no luck. At the moment I'm not overriding anything.

</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 16:33:09 GMT):<br/>

you can take a look at my repo if you want. It gets rid of all the example.com crap and templatizes it https://github.com/Blockdaemon/hlf-service-network

</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 16:46:40 GMT):<br/>
The main difference was me having to add a bunch of policies to configtx.yaml, and needing a channel name for the orderer genesis block (to avoid a warning) iirc
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 16:48:39 GMT):<br/>
But in general I share your frustration that a lot of the error reporting is cryptic, and generally unhelpful when tracking down problems.

<p><strong>Taaanos</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 18:48:53 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=oB6WiPkB9w7qLcE2q) @nyet what do you mean by OS go lint related packages? I have tried brew (which installed 1.11.2) and then followed the procedure to uninstall and tried with 1.10.4 dmg. But I am getting the same on ubuntu with directly installing 1.10.4
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 18:49:32 GMT):<br/>
there are various metalint packages in both brew and .deb pkgs, maybe something ended up in `/usr/bin` or your `brew` path?
</p>
<p><strong>Taaanos</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 18:50:58 GMT):<br/>
will check this out as well
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 18:50:59 GMT):<br/>
for example, on debian, the golint package installs `/usr/bin/golint`
</p>
<p><strong>Taaanos</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 18:51:39 GMT):<br/>
I believe after some commit (2 months ago) version check for `go` got introduced
</p>

I believe after some commit (2 months ago) there version check for go introduced
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 18:51:42 GMT):<br/>
but in practice, `$GOPATH/bin` should be before `/usr/local/bin` and `/usr/bin` in your `PATH`
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 18:53:08 GMT):<br/>
trying it now again in `fabric-sdk-go` on my machine
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 18:53:22 GMT):<br/>
```nyet@nyet-0:~/go/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go$ make depend
Checking Go version
go version go1.10.4 linux/amd64
``` etc
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 18:54:13 GMT):<br/>
the first thing `make depend` does is to install all the linters into `$GOPATH/bin`
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 18:54:42 GMT):<br/>
and if that is first in your PATH, everything should be fine
```$ echo $PATH
/home/nyet/go/bin:/home/nyet/.local/bin:/home/nyet/bin:/home/nyet/.gvm/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games:/snap/bin
```
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 20:39:56 GMT):<br/>
yes, I had the same issue when I upgrade to go 1.11 then reverted backed to 1.10.4, brew did not downgrade `gofmt` and `goimport` binaries, I had to remove them and re install a fresh Go 1.10.4 from brew @Taaanos @nyet 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 20:40:48 GMT):<br/>
@nyet apparently Jenkins was down till around 12:30-1:00 pm EST... I posted a `reverify-z` on your patch, the build is running
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 20:59:00 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk if you didn't change anything i suspect it will still randomly fail sometimes
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 20:59:51 GMT):<br/>
pewp this is new ```Creating network "fabsdkgo_default" with the default driver

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=ttxJsxn4wvmA52JGK) @nyet I added retry invocations in the tests that were failing randomly 
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 21:01:17 GMT):<br/>
this was from yesterday though no? unless you did a second rebase (i did not)
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 21:05:28 GMT):<br/>
yes from yesterday.. the z build error yesterday you got after the rebase had no retries though.. 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 21:06:32 GMT):<br/>
I've seen it in the past, it's the only one for which I have not added a retry since it depends on the error type returned... I'll probably add a retry for it as well
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 21:06:34 GMT):<br/>
well i see the last build succeeded regardless ;)
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 21:07:09 GMT):<br/>
yes, because the error is intermittent, it doesn't always happen
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 21:07:56 GMT):<br/>
Also i see that sudesh R+1 but then R-1 ... is this because I didn't add a test case? I can add one but the jenkins stuff made me not want to do it yet
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 21:08:38 GMT):<br/>
yes, if you can add an assert call maybe
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 21:09:03 GMT):<br/>
I will time permitting but i have other things on my plate now :/
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 21:10:05 GMT):<br/>
I think he saw your build was failing, so he removed the +1.. but adding an assert call is shorter than if err != nil
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 21:10:06 GMT):<br/>
You mean basically assert the default values by testing the new configImpl btw?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 21:10:17 GMT):<br/>
oh i see
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 21:10:27 GMT):<br/>
i thought he meant actually test to see if the values were right
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 21:10:44 GMT):<br/>
that too :)
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 21:11:29 GMT):<br/>
it makes sense if defaults == true and that New() returned false values should fail
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 21:36:29 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk BTW are you implying I won't get a CR+1 until I write real unit tests? :)
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 21:44:09 GMT):<br/>
@nyet I'm not implying anything, just answered your question about the R+1 above :)
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 21:44:45 GMT):<br/>
grin
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 21:46:46 GMT):<br/>
well usually folks are inclined to give +1/+2 when their comments are addressed... just saying
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 22:51:14 GMT):<br/>
welp it was easy enough so i added a test case

Hi!, i want to use the GO sdk but i don't know if i can use the 1.11 version, can you help me? Ty
</p>
<p><strong>Taaanos</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 12:32:48 GMT):<br/>
@nyet @Baha-sk Just to be sure, retried everything with a fresh ubuntu vm. Installed 1.10.4 from golang.org and go/bin is first in my path. I believe if you try it on a fresh installation it is easily replicable. 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 15:35:45 GMT):<br/>
@enriquebusti Go 1.11 is not supported by Go SDK for now
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 15:38:23 GMT):<br/>
not until Fabric 1.4 at least
</p>
<p><strong>Taaanos</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 15:47:59 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk could you post your `gometalinter.json` config?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:12:20 GMT):<br/>
@Taaanos it's in the root of Go SDK
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:12:23 GMT):<br/>
I have not changed it
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:12:58 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk with regards to your adding retries to the unit tests: why doesn't the sdk have this functionality built in so the caller doesn't have to explicitly add retry code?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:13:22 GMT):<br/>
@Taaanos did you run "make depend" first, before "make"
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:14:22 GMT):<br/>
@nyet these retries are specific to the integration tests with a "test" code in case of specific errors... client apps should handle the retries following their own logic..
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:17:05 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk But this specific error is one I would expect to always potentially come up: 500 until the peer cc is ready, then either success or some other error. I could see this being a common issue; I  don't see that there should be chain specific handling to avoid the race.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:19:08 GMT):<br/>
in this specific CC2CC invocation call, we expect and error code 10 (pb.TxValidationCode_ENDORSEMENT_POLICY_FAILURE).. error 500 is returned because the peer did not respond (due network lag or something).. so we retry until error 10 is returned or we exhaust the retries in which case it's a test failure
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:20:12 GMT):<br/>
we don't wanna treat error 500 as a successful negative case in this test
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:20:13 GMT):<br/>
I understand that, but I feel the sdk should be tolerant of network lag (or whatever the transient problem is), since that should be covered by the retry options.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:20:43 GMT):<br/>
this is why retriable codes were introduced.. but each case is different
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:20:44 GMT):<br/>
the underlying transient issue should be invisible to the sdk client
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:21:27 GMT):<br/>
the client cannot control the network.. ie what's acceptable for one client may not for another client.. this is why it's configurable
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:21:28 GMT):<br/>
So the question becomes, why don't the default retry options handle this case, and if it is because the values are not conservative enough, shouldn't the default values be increased accordingly?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:21:53 GMT):<br/>
Or at least the retry options should be adjusted for this test case?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:22:56 GMT):<br/>
I generally don't agree that these sorts of retry things should be wrapped around OTHER retry things unless they are unavoidable, and in either case, if it can't be compensated for by the extant retry mechanisms, this new, more complex mechanism  should be includied in the sdk itself
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:23:01 GMT):<br/>
this is why in the integration tests, we're using `retry.TestRetryOpts` as default error options
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:23:13 GMT):<br/>
Would increasing that have fixed the issue for htis test case?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:23:53 GMT):<br/>
if not, why (e.g. it requires a diferent layer of retry), and if that is true, that layer should be provided as part of the extant retry mechanisms inside the sdk itself
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:23:54 GMT):<br/>
this includes default retries.. but we can't enforce this in all the client invokes
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:25:06 GMT):<br/>
also `channel.WithRetry(retry.DefaultChannelOpts)` vs `retry.New(retry.TestRetryOpts)`
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:25:10 GMT):<br/>
the # of retries and retry wait times are configurable, and the tests show how one can setup their own
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:25:38 GMT):<br/>
yes, this is an example of adding a specific returnable options (for channel client for instance)
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:26:22 GMT):<br/>
Why can't this already be done without altering the `retry.DefaultChannelOpts`
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:26:22 GMT):<br/>
Why can't this already be done by altering the `retry.DefaultChannelOpts`
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:26:33 GMT):<br/>
basically my additional invoker call (on top of channel.WithRetry(retry.DefaultChannelOpts)) will do retries on error 500
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:27:17 GMT):<br/>
My point is, if that is potentially a problem, it should be possible to ask for by adjusting the `WithRetry()`, and not by forcing the user to write a `NewInvoker()`
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:28:02 GMT):<br/>
With the understanding it is a network problem possibly not caught by `WithRetry()`
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:28:23 GMT):<br/>
In which case i think it SHOULD be caught by `WithRetry()` it self
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:28:26 GMT):<br/>
I don't want to change real client code (retry.DefaultChannelOpts) because of a test issue ( happening on z build only)
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:28:50 GMT):<br/>
in my experience, race conditions that can occur in one case can always occur in another, it is just a matter of odds :)
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:29:22 GMT):<br/>
not trying to cause trouble btw I'm also asking these questions to leran.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:30:13 GMT):<br/>
hence the addition of the invoker.. this could happen in real world applications... this is why the sdk users can come up with their own retriable options to suit their specific environment on top of the default options
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:31:07 GMT):<br/>
As a user, I would be baffled though, if `WithRetry()` was not sufficient to catch the problem, and if the only solutiohn was to wrap it with a `retry.NewInvoker()`
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:31:18 GMT):<br/>
for instance these codes ```		status.Code(pb.TxValidationCode_DUPLICATE_TXID),
		status.Code(pb.TxValidationCode_ENDORSEMENT_POLICY_FAILURE),
		status.Code(pb.TxValidationCode_MVCC_READ_CONFLICT),
		status.Code(pb.TxValidationCode_PHANTOM_READ_CONFLICT),``` are specific to the event server..
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:32:17 GMT):<br/>
we can't mix these with app specific code.. this is why users can add their own invoke retry options on top of the defaults (not mixed with the defaults)
</p>

ok
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:34:00 GMT):<br/>
So out of curiosity, what is the transient error that is not 500 or `ENDORSEMENT_POLICY_FAILURE` in this case?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:34:28 GMT):<br/>
(that the retry is ignoring)
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:35:06 GMT):<br/>
I suppose i could go look at the logs myself heeh
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:37:30 GMT):<br/>
```integration-tests_1  |     		
	            	expected: 10
integration-tests_1  |     		
	            	actual  : 500```
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:37:43 GMT):<br/>
looks like your `Equal()` options are reversed btw
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:38:23 GMT):<br/>
oh wait you are expecting 10 but getting 500
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:39:04 GMT):<br/>
Wait, but your retry bails if it sees 500 unless I'm reading this wrong
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:39:18 GMT):<br/>
`if e != nil && strings.Contains(e.Error(), "500") {`
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:40:01 GMT):<br/>
why is that looking for `Contains(.. "500")` and not `stat.Code==500`
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:40:01 GMT):<br/>
why is that looking for `Contains(.. "500")` and not `status.FromError(err).Code==500`
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:41:30 GMT):<br/>
i geusse that saves having to trap other exceptions from `FromError` :/
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:44:08 GMT):<br/>
oh nvm, it makes the 500 a retry condition.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:44:14 GMT):<br/>
I see.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:47:06 GMT):<br/>
I still don't see why `WithRetry()` can handling the 500 case for you.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:47:06 GMT):<br/>
I still don't see why `WithRetry()` can't handle the 500 case for you.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:47:33 GMT):<br/>
is it not meant to?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:49:03 GMT):<br/>
I did paste error 10 earlier, it's `pb.TxValidationCode_ENDORSEMENT_POLICY_FAILURE`
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:50:12 GMT):<br/>
(again, not trying to cause trouble, trying to learn when `WithRetry()` can be used and when it can't)
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:50:33 GMT):<br/>
that particular test is expecting this error due to expected endorsement failure.. that's what I was explaining before.. but error 500 is a system error.. we can probably add a retry default error.. but it's left to the user to handle for now
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:51:27 GMT):<br/>
Yah, i understand that the test is looking for 10.. is the problem because `RetryWith()` wll retry if it sees 10?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:53:07 GMT):<br/>
no, the client will not retry if endorsement error is 10, it just returns the error
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:53:32 GMT):<br/>
the client will retry for these 2 error codes from the endorser server: ```status.EndorserServerStatus: {
		status.Code(common.Status_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE),
		status.Code(common.Status_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR),
	},```
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:53:40 GMT):<br/>
So the default retry isn't working because it isn't conservative enough, not beecause of the specifics of the test?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:53:52 GMT):<br/>
as per `retry.DefaultChannelOpts`
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:54:28 GMT):<br/>
I'm trying to understand why (exactly) when the defeault retry meachinism will not work, and has to be wrapped with a different retry layer
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:54:36 GMT):<br/>
the test should not retry on error code 10 because it expects it
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:55:07 GMT):<br/>
ya, so `RetryWith()` WILL retry if it sees 10?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:55:11 GMT):<br/>
the additional invoker call I added was to check if the error code is 500, to trigger a retry
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:55:40 GMT):<br/>
no, it will not for code 10.. that's what I said earlier
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:55:58 GMT):<br/>
So why can't the normal retry mechanism be used?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:56:13 GMT):<br/>
if it is just a case of # retries or timeout difference
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:56:29 GMT):<br/>
`	channel.WithRetry(retry.DefaultChannelOpts),` this is being used.. but it doesn't check for error code 500
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:56:42 GMT):<br/>
OK so it will NOT retry on 500 either
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:56:57 GMT):<br/>
this is why `retry.NewInvoker(retry.New(retry.TestRetryOpts)).Invoke(` was added (to trigger retries on error 500)
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:57:01 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:57:20 GMT):<br/>
only if this condition is met: `	if e != nil && strings.Contains(e.Error(), "500") `
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:57:42 GMT):<br/>
I think I see. The problem is that `WithRetry()` will NOT retry if it sees 500, it will return immediately with 500, no retries, and the wrapper retries around 500
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:57:50 GMT):<br/>

Is there a sandbox place to put test merges for submission to jenkins? I'd like to do a couple reverify-z with your fix

@nyet can you compare the binaries in @GOPATH/bin between the vm and your local machine? to see if the files differ in size?

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 18:38:20 GMT):<br/>
and same issue, so it isn't the binaries
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 18:43:14 GMT):<br/>
weird! the binaries should behave the same way.. unless the vm has a different os version, or there's a different copy accessible somewhere
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 18:45:09 GMT):<br/>
There is something else going on that has nothing to do with the binaries, not sure what
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 18:49:00 GMT):<br/>
why does `pkg/core/cryptosuite/common/pkcs11/contextHandle.go` import `"github.com/miekg/pkcs11"`? The package itself is named pkcs11
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 18:50:43 GMT):<br/>
the sdk's pkg.core.cryptosuite.common.pkcs11 is using miekg's miekg.pkcs11 package
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 18:51:26 GMT):<br/>
A huge proportion of the warnings are from that file

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 18:59:50 GMT):<br/>
They're all about pkcs11 package issues. Is it a namespace issue?

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 19:01:09 GMT):<br/>
the vendor directories are very different between these two repos

something is wrong with vendoring

delete the vendor folder and run `make populate`

Is it somehow possible to avoid hosts entries like "127.0.0.1 ca.xyz.com" if you get "dial tcp: lookup ca.xyz.com on 1.1.1.1:53: no such host" ?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 20:52:47 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=thi6BEKvc2aijwxRR) @chrim5 you can add an entityMatchers section in config.yaml which will map your peer hosts to localhost like this https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/config/overrides/local_entity_matchers.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>chrim5</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 21:28:42 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk Thanks. Then it looks like I misconfigured that part:
    - pattern: (\w*).xyz.(\w*)
      urlSubstitutionExp: https://ca.xyz.com:7054
      mappedHost: localhost
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 21:37:56 GMT):<br/>
mappedHost should match the peer id in your config 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 21:42:56 GMT):<br/>
```- pattern: peer0.org1.example.(\w+).    >>>> is the url pattern that will be converted
      urlSubstitutionExp: localhost:7051.      >>>> will be converted to this url expression
      sslTargetOverrideUrlSubstitutionExp: peer0.org1.example.com.    >>>> will convert the sslTargerOverride.. usually this matches your real peer name to match the cert subject (for SSL connectivity)
      mappedHost: peer0.org1.example.com.    >>> this is the peer ID for which peer configs will be used for the particular matched pattern```

@Baha-sk @Taaanos I think i may have found the issue; the external `pkcs11` dependency will not build without `libltdl-dev`, and if it doesn't build, the linter doesn't know `pkcs11` is imported, it thinks it is the local package. I've seen simliar things with golang before if an `import` namespace matches the local `package`

I am not sure but i think it might be considered poor practice to have the local package match an import namespace.

@nyet thanks for digging deep into the issue.. probably best to rename the go sdk package.. @troyronda what do you think ^^^ 
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 22:52:15 GMT):<br/>
Basically, i did an `apt install libltdl-dev` and it worked. I think `"github.com/miekg/pkcs11"` should be ` mPkcs11 "github.com/miekg/pkcs11" or something similar in `contgextHandle.go`

yeah, we can also use a different label too.. probably less intrusive than renaming the package

hello every:)
I tried to use fabric-go-sdk to do invoke/query, but got the following error:
`Endorser Client Status Code: (23) CHAINCODE_NAME_NOT_FOUND. Description: could not find chaincode with name 'lscc'`
But when I checkout version to git version f3fee0ed, it is OK to use lscc
any idea on this?

Now that the issue is solved I want to profile somethings. I would like to experiment with tests and get some profiles analyzed with gprof. Which network do i need to deploy in order for tests to be able to connect with the network?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=XEkhNEsDHDngX9XZu) @Taaanos this is possible.. you have to make sure whatever tests you're running separately is complete (ie channel is created, peers have joined the channel and CCs are installed and instantiated..)
</p>
<p><strong>Taaanos</strong> (Tue, 20 Nov 2018 15:35:01 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=HGAeEYh3dF7yKejdi) @Baha-sk is there an easy way do set up the particular network that is needed? 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 20 Nov 2018 15:37:45 GMT):<br/>
@Taaanos, you need to look at the test you're running and see if it depends on a setup() call or something.. also, if your test does the setup, you have to restart your network every time you run the test (or comment out the setup after the first run)
</p>

<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 20 Nov 2018 16:30:39 GMT):<br/>
@midoblgsm is your peer `blockchain-org1peer1` up and running and do you have msp credentials for your client to connect to it? 
look at the examples in /test/integration/e2e/end_to_end.go for an example creation of the sdk (client).. example configs are found in test/fixtures/config ... I assume you know how to start your peers network (without it, you can't do anything, look at the docker-compose yams files in /test/fixtures/dockerenv for examples)

@midoblgsm is your peer `blockchain-org1peer1` up and running and do you have msp credentials for your client to connect to it? 
look at the examples in /test/integration/e2e/end_to_end.go for an example creation of the sdk (client).. example configs are found in test/fixtures/config ... I assume you know how to start your peers network (without it, you can't do anything, look at the docker-compose yaml files in /test/fixtures/dockerenv for examples) 
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 20 Nov 2018 16:39:21 GMT):<br/>
@midoblgsm does your SDK have a way to resolve `blockchain-org1peer1` to an IP address? It needs to be in DNS, `/etc/hosts`, or `config.yaml entityMatchers` (preferably the latter)

I have set up a Fabric Go SDK on a Raspberry Pi to talk to a remote fabric instance. I can query the ledger, but if I try to write transactions to the ledger (channel.Execute), a runtime error occurs.
Most likely it is an issue with the 32 bit arm operating system, and atomic.addUint64() panics if the pointer to its argument is not 64byte aligned.
Here is the error message:
 panic: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference
[signal SIGSEGV: segmentation violation code=0x1 addr=0x4 pc=0x11e08]

@jje You're likely out of memory.

Is the that copy/paste from the `peer` command accurate? Because it also prints garbage. That tells me something is definitely broken for both `peer` and the sdk.

Anyone insterested in picking this up? https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/FABG/issues/FABG-786
We are using the Go SDK in production and this is a VERY important feature of fabric. Especially with private collections...

Unfortunately, I don't feel like contributing it myself because it is a bigger change than expected :(

<p><strong>JaccobSmith</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 01:02:38 GMT):<br/>
Is the Fabric a permissible System？ I think it's not a problem，because even though someone can upgrade one peer‘s chaincode，Can he change all the chaincode of all the other peers

@SandySun2000 -  please check if your channel has anchor peers
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 19:02:50 GMT):<br/>
and also check if the peers have external endpoints configured
</p>
<p><strong>SandySun2000</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 19:21:20 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm From the debug log, I found that both peers were configured for endpoints, Since anchor peer is using address reference, I couldn't tell weather it is peer1 or peer2.

no, i only know the fabric core, and sometimes can apply common sense and basic deduction rules
</p>
<p><strong>vieiramanoel</strong> (Wed, 05 Dec 2018 23:04:34 GMT):<br/>
this is critical, and docs are not clear at all about user management through config file. We are about to move all our go-sdk based chaincode apis to node-sdk.

Suppose there are two peers I want one one peer to setup the some rules or treaty then the second peer has to initialize the data , but while initializing it has to check and satisfy the treaty or rules created by another peer …. Where should I write this thing?
hey hai if you can give me some idea for the above mentioned one if would be great

HI 
I can't really figured out how to decode or unmarshal a common.Block struct that I retrieve from a ledger.QueryBlock. 
I would like to access the list of transaction. It should be pretty common to do that. I saw that in node you could do this doing something like https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/global.html#Block 
Any clue on how to make this work in go

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=MJodBLosMqoRRo9TC) @bandreghetti this is the equivalent of https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/config/config_e2e.yaml#L261 but you're embedding the users credentials in the configs 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 17:18:06 GMT):<br/>
both should work
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 17:20:03 GMT):<br/>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=HqpvQThpypfXipXk2) @vieiramanoel are you on Mac or Linux? try to provide a relative path instead of an absolute path (remove the `/` in front of `/crypto/users/`) and make sure the path is accessible to the config... also you might wanna escape the `@` maybe? or rename that folder  to not have an @ and try again
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 17:24:56 GMT):<br/>
this should work, otherwise the unit/integration tests would fail as well

<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 17:37:52 GMT):<br/>
you can also fully embed the cert inside the config by replace `path` field to `pem` field like
   ```
   users:
      Admin:
        cert:
          pem: |
                    -----your cert content------

```

@bandreghetti have you created a configtx.yaml file to create a genesis block with proper orgs info like the following: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/fabric/v1.3/config/configtx.yaml#L16 ?

Hello, all, I want to enroll a identity with a sub ca like "ca1" or "ca2" in the CA server, how could I do ?
</p>
<p><strong>JaccobSmith</strong> (Fri, 07 Dec 2018 03:37:17 GMT):<br/>
With the msp.New function ,I could just choose the most external CA server in an organization 
</p>
<p><strong>JaccobSmith</strong> (Fri, 07 Dec 2018 03:53:17 GMT):<br/>
OK, I directly change the CAconfig() interface to change the CAname temporarily and after enrolling has done then I restore this value

I am struggling to setup sdk client with multiple MSPs. It seems go sdk only supports one MSP which is defined in client config. Do you have some guidelines how to setup sdk client with multiple msps?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 07 Dec 2018 15:48:12 GMT):<br/>
@pkarolis in `config.yaml` you can set up separate organizations, each with a different MSP
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 07 Dec 2018 15:49:07 GMT):<br/>
Then, when you do `sdk.Context()` you pass it that `WithOrg()`
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 07 Dec 2018 15:58:36 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure but the top level `name` in `config.yaml` is probably also selectable but I confess I'm not sure how.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 07 Dec 2018 15:59:08 GMT):<br/>
(i.e. if you have multiple `name`d entities in `config.yaml`)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=hoN7pPHn2MWCeC4qA) @Baha-sk @Baha-sk Thank for your answer. The point is that I can't understand how to unmarshal the informations. I saw the `XXX_Unmarshal` function but it's not so crear for me the way it  works. I haven't found no test for reading the transactions from the block.
Moreover even if I trigger 2 chaincode invocation in a row, they are not grouped in the same block as I expect but two blocks are produced.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=THF5KksarFYNxDARS) @yacovm It is possible to override the SDK's usage of selection and discovery services in the SDK constructor. However, we don't really have samples as our focus is on versions of Fabric that support dynamic discovery.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 15:25:19 GMT):<br/>
The closest I have is the test code which overrides for test purposes. E.g., https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/04245219f7bfed096d917dc2001aecaf85e8ee18/test/integration/pkg/fabsdk/provider/sdk_dyndiscovery_test.go#L33

is there a more concise way to do this

                // Let other setDefault()s below fill in what is required, since this hook will be called
                // again for the empty dataMap.
                if t == reflect.TypeOf(map[string]PeerChannelConfig{}) {
                        dataMap, ok := data.(map[string]interface{})

Hey guys, I'm having some issues where have upgraded chain code, but when I then go to call chain code on gosdk find that it calls the old version. Anywhere to specify version number from the SDK have not been able to find in the docs anywhere 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 11:34:49 GMT):<br/>
you can't specify a version number
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 11:35:00 GMT):<br/>
you need to forcefully kill and remove the old container
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 11:35:05 GMT):<br/>
and then re-issue the invoke
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 11:35:12 GMT):<br/>
in order for the new container to be created
</p>
<p><strong>lay-z</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 12:48:05 GMT):<br/>
ohhh, unfortunately we are working with IBMs platform, so they are in charge of containers, i can't just delete the old one and re-invoke :cry:

@lay-z 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 12:56:08 GMT):<br/>
actually i think it should build it during the invoke
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 12:56:14 GMT):<br/>
the new version chaincode, that is
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 13:01:01 GMT):<br/>
so i was wrong
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 13:01:19 GMT):<br/>
i'm not sure why it calls the old version - you should check, maybe the upgrade transaction didn't work
</p>
<p><strong>lay-z</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 13:04:40 GMT):<br/>
I think this is it, the upgrade didn't exactly work right. We had not invoked the new version. once we had done this. it was no issues. Is there any particular reason why we don't have the ability to use different versions of chaincode at the same time?? is this more particular towards fabric? I believe that the Nodesdk you can actually pass a version number in as well.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 13:05:21 GMT):<br/>
you can use different versions only in 2 different channels
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 13:05:26 GMT):<br/>
a version is bound to the channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 13:05:33 GMT):<br/>
that's what the upgrade transaction does
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 13:05:46 GMT):<br/>
it links the version, and the chaincode code's hash - to the channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 13:06:22 GMT):<br/>
so that if you invoke a chaincode later after the upgrade and a peer has a non upgraded chaincode, it will look the chaincode hash in the channel (ledger), and the hash computed from the file system, and compare
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 13:07:07 GMT):<br/>
>  I believe that the Nodesdk you can actually pass a version number in as well. 
if you can, then it has no sense.... since in a channel, at any given time - only a single version exists.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 13:07:26 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 ^ is that true that you can pass a version in the node SDK ?

Same here, I find go sdk helpful and haven't faced any issues @greivinlopez .. It is sometimes strange to receive some comments from some cloud providers when they offer blockchain as a service they say that they haven't tested with Go SDK and also IBM recently on IBP when supporting 1.2 on Starter plan have disabled discovery service (hopefully they don't do so on Enterprise Plan) and go SDK by default requiring discovery service... You may or may not run in to these issues but otherwise it has been rock solid

@greivinlopez i didn't even use dep for mine. I just did `go get` and `go build`
https://github.com/Blockdaemon/hlf-database-app
</p>
<p><strong>greivinlopez</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 20:21:45 GMT):<br/>
@nyet it was not possible for me to just do a go get of the sdk and be able to build my code.  I needed to install dep and run the "make" command on the SDK before able to compile my code.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 20:22:06 GMT):<br/>
i dont recall having to do that
</p>
<p><strong>greivinlopez</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 20:22:56 GMT):<br/>
@nyet take into account I'm using a clean vm with a fresh go installation.

I'm also working on a multi-host network that does not rely on docker nor the nodes are running on the same machine but in the cloud.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 20:24:46 GMT):<br/>
im just purely talking about building
</p>
<p><strong>greivinlopez</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 20:25:23 GMT):<br/>
yeah I know I was just clarifying that the host machine were you are building could have some other stuff

<p><strong>greivinlopez</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 20:25:40 GMT):<br/>
that I probably don't have installed

Perhaps I'm missing something I just started this week playing with the go sdk
</p>
<p><strong>greivinlopez</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 20:34:08 GMT):<br/>
I'll let you know if I discover my problem or if I had more questions. Most probably the latter :sweat_smile:
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 20:34:57 GMT):<br/>
The makfile in the sdk is really only needed to run CI tests
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 20:35:16 GMT):<br/>
you can refer to the sdk in your code by just referring to the git repo
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 20:37:01 GMT):<br/>
I generally only use dep as a last resort (i.e. some upstream library is poorly designed so it is locked to some version)

 I am running a network of multiple org. Able to do all the transactions using the tools/cli. Want them to integrate them with our web app . Any getting started guide for fbaric-go-sdk ?
</p>
<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Mon, 24 Dec 2018 10:40:54 GMT):<br/>
@javapriyan have a look at https://github.com/chainHero/heroes-service These guys have come up with a very nice example on how to integrate HLF with/as a web application.

I agree, it is overly complex and does not have enough sane default settings

sort of like HLF in general :/

<p><strong>JaccobSmith</strong> (Wed, 26 Dec 2018 05:09:30 GMT):<br/>
Is there an interface of SDK for just verifying the password of an existing identity ?
I really don't want to use the enroll or reenroll interface ,because both of them cause a new generating of the key file and the certificate file

</p>
<p><strong>secmask</strong> (Wed, 26 Dec 2018 05:38:37 GMT):<br/>
basic set for channel client like this https://gist.github.com/secmask/cc37a10e0bfe3b6d7fea4479da45c5b6

</p>
<p><strong>secmask</strong> (Wed, 26 Dec 2018 05:39:12 GMT):<br/>
if you need to deploy chaincode instead, you will need to create rest management object like above test does.
</p>
<p><strong>javapriyan</strong> (Wed, 26 Dec 2018 05:47:51 GMT):<br/>
What I am trying to do is, just query the network as we are currently trying to keep the network ops manual 
</p>
<p><strong>javapriyan</strong> (Wed, 26 Dec 2018 05:48:22 GMT):<br/>
So, I don't need a Resource management client right ?

I am trying to make a client connecting to  a fabric network (the sample in the byfn), but not able to connect to the peer in the fabric network. 
If I use url: peer0.org1.example.com:7051, the connection cannot be set up, if I use ip (localhost), the connection can be set up but the sdk will discard this peer due to some reason...

In the config yaml file, i don't understand why use credentialStore path and cryptoStore path as /tmp, because in /tmp folder, OS will cleanup it in sometime. Then we lost all the credential and key-value store. Can we change to another place to avoid this? Can we also support use ENVIRONMENT variable to dynamic config the path? I just tried, this part not support.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=wMHJRgwAvaCSJMsFW) @Kyroy I created the config struct as
 `
channelsConfig := map[string]fab.ChannelEndpointConfig{

Passed the information to setup as

Hi to everyone . I'm a beginner in this world and I've a question for you. I wrote a chaincode to manage artworks and I need to bring up a REST service. Can you show me any guides ,tutorials or steps to build it?
I wrote chaincode in golang
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 03 Jan 2019 22:54:47 GMT):<br/>
Make a REST server in golang and have it talk to a fabric network using the golang fabric sdk

I'm running into issues decoding the block data on block events -- I can get most of the data except the juicy bits that I'm after: the R/W sets for the transaction. I would appreciate any insights/pointers on this.

Here is the current code 
```
var( channelsConfig = map[string]fab.ChannelEndpointConfig{

					InitialBackoff: 500 * time.Millisecond,
					MaxBackoff:     5 * time.Second,
					BackoffFactor:  2.0,
				},
			},
		},
	},
	
}

channelConfigImpl = &exampleChannelConfig{}

endpointConfigImpls = []interface{}{
	channelConfigImpl,
}
)

type exampleChannelConfig struct{}

func (m *exampleChannelConfig) ChannelConfig(name string) *fab.ChannelEndpointConfig {
	ch, ok := channelsConfig[strings.ToLower(name)]
	if !ok {
	
		return &fab.ChannelEndpointConfig{}
	}

	return &ch
}```

`endpointConfigImpls` is passed as `ChannelEndpointCnf []interface{}` to my setup.go where I do the sdk initialization as
```sdk,err := fabsdk.New(nil,fabsdk.WithEndpointConfig(setup.ChannelEndpointCnf))```

The error it shows is 
```Unable to initialize the Fabric SDK: failed to create SDK for MRF: Error in option passed to New: option []interface {}{(*main.exampleChannelConfig)(0xfeb920)} is not a sub interface of EndpointConfig, at least one of its functions must be implemented.

<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 14:11:52 GMT):<br/>
@rootDistress You can call the configtx tool via Command or call Fabric code `MakeChannelCreationTransaction`

</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 14:15:16 GMT):<br/>
@rootDistress You can. You have to dynamically create the config file and then call it via: https://golang.org/pkg/os/exec/

<p><strong>jellevdp</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 15:17:50 GMT):<br/>
Q: The node-sdk has a block-decoder to decode the base64 data element that gets returned by the QueryBlock function: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/release-1.3/fabric-client/lib/BlockDecoder.js. Does the go-sdk have a similar function available? 
</p>
<p><strong>jellevdp</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 15:57:33 GMT):<br/>
@PaulStuart similar issue here. The QueryBlock function seems to give me a json structure for the blockheader but for the data I receive a base64 string that, when decoded does not have any structure

<p><strong>PaulStuart</strong> (Sun, 06 Jan 2019 16:24:55 GMT):<br/>
@jellevdp the go data structures are all protobuf defines, but instead of having a Block struct with hierarchical structs representing the entire tree it seems to be mainly []byte payloads that need some magic decoder func. I found code that decodes blocks here: https://github.com/cendhu/fetch-block

One point I realized after posting my comment is that I'm on alpha-3 of the SDK because IBM hosting lags horribly behind the releases, so it may be fixed in the latest rev.

While instantiating sdk with overriding only containing channelconfig part like at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/e2e/configless/endpointconfig_override_test.go, is it possible to get rest from a config file. 

What I mean is, if I try to override channel config with 
```
channelConfigImpl = &exampleChannelConfig{}

endpointConfigImpls = []interface{}{
	channelConfigImpl,
}
```
But want rest of the config from the `config.yaml` and I instantiate the sdk like 
`sdk,err := fabsdk.New(config.FromFile(setup.ConfigFile),fabsdk.WithEndpointConfig(endpointConfigImpls...))`
does the sdk have config of channel in its chConfig cache ? because I'm not able to find the peers after creation and joining of a channel.

@vikimeng if they lost the priv key they have to re-enroll.

</p>
<p><strong>rootDistress</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 11:06:05 GMT):<br/>
Also, Is the process of updating a channel like adding a peer or an org similar to just channel creation and joining like at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/e2e/orgs/multiple_orgs_test.go#L163 ?

I've encountered a problem, I was overriding the configs using https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/e2e/configless/endpointconfig_override_test.go and dynamically creating channels using https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/303f01c92fd71b2d0870932641b5c4460eb60202/test/integration/e2e/orgs/multiple_orgs_test.go#L163

The problem is that the peers not defined in channelsConfig are also joining the channel and are able to query chaincode.
Can someone think what can cause this problem?

especially when create channels,  in RAFT based consensus , different channel will be using different order service nodes. In this way ,we will need to give the orderer list when create channels.

@rootDistress once the original channel config is saved in the orderer, you cannot save a newly regenerated config for the same channel..  the error above means the orderer does not trust the new request as the config signature is invalid (it is not aware of the newly added org)

Is there a way to do this through go sdk?

I am following the steps here - https://github.com/chainHero/heroes-service. First issue I have run into is with setting the peer url in https://github.com/chainHero/heroes-service/blob/master/config.yaml. I have the peers and the cli set up in different nodes on cloud, each node has a single docker container. All docker containers are connected by docker swarm. Which URL should I use for the peer in config.yaml - peer's floating ip or private ip or something else?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 17 Jan 2019 05:48:20 GMT):<br/>
The ip you intend to connect to with the app using the go sdk
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 17 Jan 2019 05:48:39 GMT):<br/>
you'll have to remove the entityMatchers section if that ip isn't localhost
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 17 Jan 2019 05:50:10 GMT):<br/>
That example is ill suited for your PoC if the nodes are not in a local docker instance.

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:14:58 GMT):<br/>
everything works great if its all in docker on a single host
</p>
<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:15:25 GMT):<br/>
Yeah :/
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:15:45 GMT):<br/>
you'll need to dig around the log and see what the chaincode container thinks the peer ip is
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:16:20 GMT):<br/>
and see if it matches how that container woiuld actually talk to the peer. It's tricky because fabric does some hacky stuff to spin up the chaincode container. It also doesn't work well in k8s either
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:16:38 GMT):<br/>
i really wish they'd just fork/exec like normal people :/
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:16:44 GMT):<br/>
but hey its container world these days
</p>
<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:16:59 GMT):<br/>
haha
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:17:27 GMT):<br/>
I'm assuming the example works great in just plain single host docker for you?
</p>
<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:17:40 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:17:48 GMT):<br/>
as i feared ....
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:17:55 GMT):<br/>
good luck :) please message me if you figure it out
</p>
<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:17:59 GMT):<br/>
unfortunately that's not what I am looking for.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:18:06 GMT):<br/>
same here, sir!
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:18:25 GMT):<br/>
You're on the right track if its any consolation
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:18:57 GMT):<br/>
suffice to say it is a fabric issue, not an sdk issue, so you might want to get help from the fabric guys ...
</p>
<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:21:11 GMT):<br/>
i think it is an interfacing issue. i am able to instantiate and invoke in multihost setting using the fabric cli image
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:22:25 GMT):<br/>
oh thats interesting
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:22:43 GMT):<br/>
so that would make it an sdk issue
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:23:17 GMT):<br/>
well when i get my multihost k8s thing working i'll have a another datapoint for you
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:23:46 GMT):<br/>
but it uses dind so ... im guessing the chaincode container is always local to the peer pod
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:23:51 GMT):<br/>
which might not be gthe case in docker-swarm
</p>
<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:27:49 GMT):<br/>
in general, there isn't supposed to be an independent chaincode container, right?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:30:01 GMT):<br/>
yes, each peer is supposed to spin up a container for every chaincode it "hosts"
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:30:24 GMT):<br/>
but the current way assumes that container is local to the peer;s docker instance
</p>
<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:33:22 GMT):<br/>
oh, got it i think. So in my case, the sdk seems to be creating a chaincode instance in the same level as my peer instance, instead of inside my peer instance?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:45:55 GMT):<br/>
its not up to the sdk, it is the peer that does it
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:46:17 GMT):<br/>
it shouldn't matter who asks the peer to instantiate chaincode, the peer should always act the same way
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:47:10 GMT):<br/>
but maybe the sdk is passing the wrong endpoint(s) to the peer (or chaincode) so the peer cant talk to its chaincode and/or vice versa (this is all a blind guess)
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:51:57 GMT):<br/>
well if its of any help i just got my hosted GKE working with multihosts
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:52:04 GMT):<br/>
it works fine.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:52:26 GMT):<br/>
every peer/orderer is on a separate ip address, the peers are using dind to start up chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:53:00 GMT):<br/>
but the chaincode/peers talk to each other as localhost as far as i can tell
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:54:04 GMT):<br/>
```            - name: CORE_PEER_CHAINCODELISTENADDRESS
              value: "localhost:7052" # Chaincode will look for the peer here (dind)```
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:54:24 GMT):<br/>
You'll have to (maybe?) customize that for docker swarm.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:55:11 GMT):<br/>
what is your `CORE_VM_ENDPOINT` set to
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 03:55:18 GMT):<br/>

Here's my docker-compose -peer file - https://github.com/aashaka/hlf-docker-swarm/blob/master/network/org1/docker-compose-peer.yml
</p>
<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 17:31:44 GMT):<br/>
I have the `CORE_VM_ENDPOINT` as unix:///host/var/run/docker.sock. Just added `CORE_PEER_CHAINCODELISTENADDRESS`, but almost the same result. 
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 17:44:04 GMT):<br/>
If you shell into the peer/chaincode containers, can you contact the endpoints you specified?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 17:44:12 GMT):<br/>
(via curl or whatever)
</p>
<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 18:05:16 GMT):<br/>
can't resolve host: unix
</p>
<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 18:06:06 GMT):<br/>
trying to figure out the correct `CORE_VM_ENDPOINT` for docker swarm now
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 18:06:27 GMT):<br/>
thats not a hostname, thats a socket
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 18:06:34 GMT):<br/>
does that file exist on your system
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 18:06:51 GMT):<br/>
actually thats how the peer creates the chaincode container
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 18:06:58 GMT):<br/>
it talks to the docker api on that socket
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 18:07:15 GMT):<br/>
if that didn't work you wouldn't see the chaincode container at all
</p>
<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 18:08:19 GMT):<br/>
okay. i do see the chaincode container though.  
</p>
<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 18:11:44 GMT):<br/>
i see a /var/run/docker.sock
</p>
<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 18:24:13 GMT):<br/>
And `docker -H localhost:7051 info` on the peer node gives me `Get http://localhost:7051/v1.38/info: net/http: HTTP/1.x transport connection broken: malformed HTTP response "\x15\x03\x01\x00\x02\x02".

<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 18:24:13 GMT):<br/>
And `docker -H localhost:7051 info` on the peer node gives me `Get http://localhost:7051/v1.38/info: net/http: HTTP/1.x transport connection broken: malformed HTTP response "\x15\x03\x01\x00\x02\x02".

So it seems to be working fine 
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 18:43:37 GMT):<br/>
What about on the chaincode container? can it contact its peer?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 18:44:48 GMT):<br/>
the peer will always be able to see itself on 7051 :), you need to know if the peer can see the chaincode container and vice versa
</p>
<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 18:52:12 GMT):<br/>
from inside the chaincode container, it can ping all the docker swarm nodes - peers and orderers
</p>
<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 18:57:23 GMT):<br/>
that's for peer1. For peer2, the chaincode container simply exits, so i can't get into it. I am following https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/fabric/topic/28145225 and will get back 
</p>
<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 18:57:40 GMT):<br/>
thanks for your continued help :) 
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 22:56:13 GMT):<br/>
np, just make sure CORE_PEER_CHAINCODELISTENADDRESS is correct and the peer isn't just talking to itself and/or the chaincode isn't just talking to itself

While joining a channel after adding that org to the channel I am faced with ```Client authorization revoked for deliver request from 192.168.64.1:33136: Failed to reach implicit threshold of 1 sub-policies, required 1 remaining: permission denied```.

I read the docker logs and read 
``` Evaluation Failed: Only 0 policies were satisfied, but needed 1 of [ Application.Readers Orderer.Readers ]```

Here is how I added the org to channel:
* Got the ConfigGroup of New org from configtxgen
* Fetched the latest config block
* Extracted the ConfigUpdate (One containing ReadSet)
* Copied readset to make writeset
* Unmarshalled writeset and added new org config group to` writeSet.Groups["Application"].Groups["NewOrg"]`
* Updated the application version as `writeSet.Groups["Application"].Version++`
* Received the `orderer.genesis.block` from local machine and unmarshalled to config update
* changed the ReadSet, WriteSet and ChannelId of it
* Got reader bytes from `createConfigEnvelopeReader(block.Data.Data[0], configUpdateBytes)` (block here is orderer.genesis.block)
* Signed the request with existing org and did save channel
* Tried to join the channel from newly added org, failed.

  Did I miss any step? Please let me know if policies also need to be changed in this case

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=NMkL2pgrAXzkdXWXF) @nyet Setting CORE_PEER_CHAINCODELISTENADDRESS to 0.0.0.0:7052 worked for me! The complete heroes-service application is running now in a multi-host setting! The environment variables are really important. I find that they are documented in form of comments across multiple docker-compose files, but couldn't find one single comprehensive documentation of what each of them means. There seems to be scope for something like this.

I'm trying to recall if there was a peer behavior where only status codes < 400 are returned though.

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 21 Jan 2019 19:28:28 GMT):<br/>
(Note shim.Error sets status code 500).

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 21 Jan 2019 19:29:12 GMT):<br/>
You can make your own version of shim.Error with a custom status code returned.

Have any one exposed the SDK calls over a REST server ? If yes, What is the best way to manage the credentials and how to map them with the keys ?

Hi guys. Someone of you know how setup a fabric-client application in go? I build it with node sdk and works perfect but i would to build it in golang. Have you suggestions or guide or tutorials ? I'm based on 1.3 version of fabric
</p>
<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 08:06:04 GMT):<br/>
@mattmaru You can take inspiration from this workshop held at the Hyperledger Global Forum 2018 (based on Hyperleger Fabric v1.3): https://github.com/chainHero/resource-manager
</p>
<p><strong>antitoine</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 08:07:18 GMT):<br/>
@javapriyan Have you looked at the REST SDK? Perhaps more suitable: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-rest

Hi guys,

Currently, I am in the process of creating custom user stores and key stores for Redis and  ScyllaDB as I dont want file based or memory based ones.  Based on the MemoryUserStore and MemoryKeyStore I started in good spirit as it seems very straightforward. However, I quickly ran into the issue that the bccsp package is internal and blocks you from easily creating your own UserStore implementation (unless you copy the Cryptosuite or create your own implementation to match the interface as ` fabsdk.WithCorePkg` expects a suite).      To fix this I can easily fork the SDK and just add my stores to the same folder as the Memory one.  However, this is just asking for future package management mayhem.          

It is mostly the Key store that is the problem. The user store is very easy to implement as it does not use any internal packages.

Anyone already succeeded in creating a custom user or key store based on the Memory store example to connect to a database for example?  Or any tips on how to progress from here? Thanks

Hi guys, it seems to me that `client.Execute` in fabric-sdk-go will send proposals to peer and broadcast to orderer all in one function https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/e2e/end_to_end.go#L172-L178  Does sdk-go provide functions to do these 2 steps in separated functions?

<p><strong>phantom.assasin</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 16:33:04 GMT):<br/>
Is it possible to dynamically add a peer node in existing blockchain network using fabric go sdk? 
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 16:52:59 GMT):<br/>
Generally, a peer only needs CA certs and channel genesis blocks to join. There isn't much for the sdk to do.

@phantom.assasin , what @nyet said is right, the Go SDK does not manage the network, it's an SDK for client applications to communicate with peers/orderers (submit proposals, add channels, join peers to channels, enroll a user, etc.) there are multiple clients in the SDK to allow for these different types of communications, look at the different available clients here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/tree/master/pkg/client and have a look at the integration tests to understand how these are used in different scenarios: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/tree/master/test/integration/pkg/client.. look at the full end to end test to see how the SDK interacts with the network with a complete workflow example (ie create channel, join Chanel, create CC, invoke CC, etc.): https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/e2e/end_to_end_test.go

The problem is that at a certain point this function is called `func containsPeer(peers []fab.Peer, peer fab.Peer) bool {

It happens that p.url is `localhost:10051` and peer.URL is `peer1.org2.example.com:7051`
How can i fix this? Note that i have noticed that before this one there is another search for endorsers that goes smooth without passing this filtering

@GavitMc Are you using `entityMatchers` to map `peer1.org2.example.com` to `localhost` or did you (erroneously) just add localhost to your peer list? If the latter, nothing is going to work because the hostnames dont match
</p>
<p><strong>GavitMc</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 10:00:36 GMT):<br/>
I thought it has something to do with `entityMarchers` but my config file seemed fine to me. I'll post it
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 10:01:08 GMT):<br/>
The basic problem is that everybody loves to use containers these days, so everything has a ton of DNS hacks, which confuses things.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 10:01:30 GMT):<br/>
Especially since HLF really depends on TLS and DNS to be configured correctly.

Does anyone has a working multi-org network app and configuration I can use and then I can install my own chaincode in it? Because I've only found single org example online...with this I could circumvent the issue maybe..
</p>
<p><strong>GavitMc</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 14:47:46 GMT):<br/>
seems that the replacement defined in entity matchers does not happen...if in the url section i write let's say orderer.example.com:7050 instead of localhost:7050 I receive this error when I run saveChannel in sdk
```

I thought this would be replaced by entityMatchers...but doesn't seem so...if I put in the url localhost:7050 channel is saved...I think this the problem that leads to the other issue...is it possible that i have some mapping function disabled?

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 16:53:53 GMT):<br/>
I think you should put the REAL url in `peers` (not `localhost`) and let the matcher munge it to `localhost` instead.
</p>
<p><strong>GavitMc</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 17:22:44 GMT):<br/>
@nyet It was failing in`GetEndorsersForChaincode` while performing an invoke. This is with localhost in url in `peers`. If I put the real URL in `peers` I get 
```

this while trying to save the channel...so with this config it is not even able to configure the channel. It seems like the replacement to localhost does not happen

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 17:24:04 GMT):<br/>
Thats odd, the whole point to `entityMatchers` is to replace the url wiht the right thing
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 17:24:24 GMT):<br/>
the `url` in `peers` needs to be right or i dont think anything will work

can you enable debugging?

yes of course
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 17:26:51 GMT):<br/>
Also i dont see `peer1.orgx` in `channel->mychannel->peers` is that intentional?
</p>
<p><strong>GavitMc</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 17:28:41 GMT):<br/>
@nyet should i put all the peers? I thought it was only the anchor peers
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 17:28:59 GMT):<br/>
not sure if it matters. I don't think it should
</p>
<p><strong>GavitMc</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 17:29:35 GMT):<br/>
I enabled the debugging, what should I do know?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 17:29:53 GMT):<br/>
lets start by putting in the correct url (not localhost) and seeing why the matcher isn't working

I can't figure it out; youll have to add debug code to the matcher and see why it isn't subsituting localhost like it should
</p>
<p><strong>GavitMc</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 18:09:43 GMT):<br/>
where should the replacement actually happen? I don't know how to debug this..
and if I want to use your multi org app and just put my chaincode where is it? the one you linked me seems without config.yaml for sdk..
p.s thank you very much for all the help

I mean my code fails because the url is `localhost` and `peer.x` but I don't get why in the same point of the code the other one should not have `localhost` as me. I think the replacement is `peer.x-->localhost` not also the opposite right?

the matcher is ONLY for the very top level repleacment (its a hack around docker being stupid and not having real dns entries)

its only to remap an endpoint to a docker endpoint, which is always localhost and might be a weird port

In my consortium, Assume I have two orgs, I dynamically created a channel with org1 in it then added Org2 to the channel, I now want to remove org2 from the channel, Here If I use Org2 to fetch the Config Block from the orderer like
```
clientContext := setup.sdk.Context(fabsdk.WithUser("Admin"), fabsdk.WithOrg(strings.ToLower("Org2")))
	org2Peers, err := DiscoverLocalPeers(clientContext)
	if err != nil {
		return errors.WithMessage(err, "failed to create new channel client by"+Org2), nil
	}
	channelClientCtx := setup.sdk.ChannelContext(setup.ChannelID, fabsdk.WithUser("Admin"), fabsdk.WithOrg("Org2"))
	ledgerClient, err := ledger.New(channelClientCtx)
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrap(err, "failed to get ledger"), nil
	}
	chCfg, err := ledgerClient.QueryConfig(ledger.WithTargets(org0Peers[0]))
	block, err := ledgerClient.QueryBlock(chCfg.BlockNumber(), ledger.WithTargets(org0Peers[0]))
	if err != nil {
		return errors.Wrap(err, "failed to get block"), nil
	}
```
I get error as 
```
[fabsdk/fab] 2019/01/24 07:09:56 UTC - membership.(*identityImpl).Validate -> ERRO failed to deserialize identity: MSP org2.example.com is unknown

Hello all,

 
I’m learning hyperledger fabric and during testing I noted that Golang sdk for hyperledger allows to do only syncronious (modification) calls to fabric. Am I correct?
Here is explanation.
 

I have deployed “fabcar” example and tested different approaches of working with chaincode.
My client is written on Golang so I’m using Go-sdk to connect to ledger. I have subscribed on block events, to receive notification, when new block is attached to the ledger. During chaincode invokation with adding new data into ledger, I noted that block event is received earlier than code, which invoked ledger change, finished.

For example:

First in code I’m registering block event listener:

breg, beventch, err := eventClient.RegisterBlockEvent()
…
select {
	case e, ok := <-beventch:
		if ok {
			log.Println("Block event is received")
		}
…
 

And then invoking chaincode to update ledger:

response, err = chClient.Execute(channel.Request{
	ChaincodeID: chaincode_id,
	Fcn: fcn,
	Args: args,
	}, channel.WithRetry(retry.DefaultChannelOpts))

log.Print("HLF Invoking ended")


And output appeares in this order:
“Block event is received”
“HLF Invoking ended”

I.e. new block event is received earlier than code which “created” that block finishes.
It looks strange for me, because I thought, that we just send request to orderer service and not waiting competion of transaction. But it looks like in this request there is a waiting until tx(new block) will be added into ledger.
During sdk investigation I found, that code, which sends a proposal to orderer, subscribes on transaction event and waits until transaction status is received. I.e. transaction is commited.

Code links:

Initial invoke from my code: channel.Execute() line 108: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/chclient.go
Send proposal from go-sdk: invoke.Handle() line 167: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/invoke/txnhandler.go
Here on line 171 it subscribes on tx event:
	reg, statusNotifier, err := clientContext.EventService.RegisterTxStatusEvent(string(txnID))
Then sends TX to orderer:
	_, err = createAndSendTransaction(clientContext.Transactor, requestContext.Response.Proposal, requestContext.Response.Responses)

And wait until tx event is received:
select {
	case txStatus := <-statusNotifier:
 

o   Is my understanding correct and “Execute” method is syncronius and it will return response only after transaction is commited to ledger, i.e. new block is added to chain?
o   To make is async it’s possible to run “Execute” in separate go routine, but the process will live untill transaction is commited. I.e. if I run 1000 txs, in memory will be 1000 processes which will run at the same time.
So if it’s necessary 1 hour to get reponse from all of them, but I send new request (# 1001), it will stuck untill these 1000 txs are processed. Am I right?
o   Is that possible to do an async request? Is it necessary override "Execute" method and manually send requests to peers, collect responses and then send propsal request to orderer(without subscribing on tx events). Correct?


Thanks in advance for help.

There is a larger problem with the recently introduced access denied handling. The SDK also disconnects when a channel is not available at the peer because of the access denied error.

We are using the IBM Managed Blockchain based on fabric 1.2, and using the Go SDK @5e291d3a34f59beb9a8ae2bcbba388515648dc73. When we try to invoke the chaincode we have installed on the peers, we get a "no peers to connect to" error:

[fabsdk/util] 2019/01/25 12:25:57 UTC - lazyref.checkTimeStarted -> DEBU Starting timer

After putting some extra logging of our own it looks like the failure happens because the peer discovery service (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/common/discovery/dynamicdiscovery/chservice.go#L72) doesn't return any peers in its response. The targets seem to be set correctly.

After dumping the GRPC response, we get 

(*discovery.Response)(0xc4205cd600)(results:<members:<peers_by_org:<key:"org1" value:<> > > > )

We also set up a different fabric network on our own with the same chaincode, which works properly and the same dump shows this instead (some parts were redacted):

<members:<peers_by_org:<key:"Org1MSP" value:<peers:<state_info:<payload:"<redacted>" > membership_info:<payload:"<redacted>" > identity:"<redacted>" > peers:<state_info:<payload:"<redacted>" signature:"<redacted>" > membership_info:<payload:"<redacted>" signature:"<redacted>" > identity:"<redacted>" > > > peers_by_org:<key:"Org2MSP" value:<peers:<state_info:<payload:"<redacted>" signature:"<redacted>" > membership_info:<payload:"<redacted>" > identity:"<redacted>" > peers:<state_info:<payload:"<redacted>" signature:"<redacted>" > membership_info:<payload:"<redacted>" signature:"<redacted>" > identity:"<redacted>" > > > > >

I am unsure if the issue is in the configuration of the SDK or the IBM Managed fabric network. 

Has anyone seen this behaviour before?
I searched the rocket chat for the "no peers to connect to" error, and some results came up, but they seemed to be caused by other reasons, such as the peers being excluded by the sdk, not due to the response to the discovery request.

In here https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/blockchain-cloud/user/manage-channels.html#GUID-C1BCCB26-0901-4DC1-B8AC-547ED407CDCE at point 5 `MSP ID ACL `it mentions org permission always set to `ReaderWriter` and other members can be set to `ReaderOnly`.
What does this mean? Read what ? I read through https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/access_control.html and realized we can make policies for org, peers and create new policies and set them using channel config. 

However, I didn't understand how did we decide who will be in readers, writers? as the configtx.yaml specifies mspid.member or mspid.admin for each of the policy in the org. How is the member mapped to the peer ? or am I missing something big and simple here?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 14:37:25 GMT):<br/>
As I understand it, peers can only endorse, query, and get events. `ReaderWriter` and `ReaderOnly` would be for users (signing entities) only

<p><strong>aneb</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 00:38:37 GMT):<br/>
@DieYoungWsn It can be many problems.  It is a high level error message and in some cases masks the cause of the real problem.  Either way, either you have actually not matched the endorsement policy that you set when instantiating the chaincode. (not enough peers, too strict endorsement policy, etc)   If you think there is actually nothing wrong with your endorsement policy I bet that the problem is the  CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_EXTERNALENDPOINT and 
 CORE_PEER_GOSSIP_BOOTSTRAP settings in your docker compose file that are missing are not correct.    If those settings are wrong the SDK is telling you the endorsement policy cannot be satisfied.  Which is true, however the real problem is that your discovery service is not able to find the peers in the first place.    The final cause of the problem could be you forgetting to set an anchor peers as well.

<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:08:39 GMT):<br/>
does `client.Execute` return after the transaction has been executed on the peer, made it into a block and committed by the peer?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:13:54 GMT):<br/>
@sherbetlemon You'll need a notifier from `RegisterChainCodeEvent()` for that
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:14:48 GMT):<br/>
@sherbetlemon This might be helpful https://github.com/Blockdaemon/hlf-database-app/blob/master/blockchain/invoke.go
</p>
<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:16:02 GMT):<br/>
I went through https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/chclient.go#L108, which makes me think that it returns after the transaction is endorsed by the peers. 
</p>
<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:17:54 GMT):<br/>
@nyet I went through that. I am trying to get the time from the logs post-run. I just need the performance numbers and don't want to change performance by adding event listeners
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:19:37 GMT):<br/>
@sherbetlemon it depends on what you are trying to measure; if you want end to end transaction you need a listener; there is no blocking call in the sdk like that
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:20:24 GMT):<br/>
You dont HAVE to wait before you can submit another transaction
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:21:01 GMT):<br/>
There are also a ton of tuning parameters you can do to determine scatter/gather requirements etc
</p>
<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:21:52 GMT):<br/>
I was thinking of tracing from logs which tx went into which block and getting the block commit time for all peers to get end to end time
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:22:22 GMT):<br/>
If you do that you dont need to wait for the event
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:22:26 GMT):<br/>
just keep submitting transactions
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:22:56 GMT):<br/>
it will eventually back up but you can see the throughput on the commit side
</p>
<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:24:43 GMT):<br/>
This issue is slightly different. I have a fixed number of client go-routines preforming setup.clients[i].Execute for some number of txs. I increased batchtimeout and the time I had to wait for sending the next round of txs increased. I think this should only be the case if Execute returns after the transaction makes it into a block. I wonder if that is the case?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:25:21 GMT):<br/>
Execute() returns LONG before anything is actually committed
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:25:31 GMT):<br/>
Its basically instantaneous
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:26:26 GMT):<br/>
well not instasntaneous; it returns when the Orderer() accepts the transaction
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:26:26 GMT):<br/>

No. It sends it to other peers first for endorsements ...
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:27:43 GMT):<br/>
it doesn't get commited until it has enough endorsements, then it sends the results to the peers

</p>
<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:29:46 GMT):<br/>
Wait. I think the proposal goes around between peers until it gets enough endorsements, and then the client submits the endorsed proposal to the orderer, which simply checks the endorsements and cuts a block?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:30:36 GMT):<br/>
the peer(s) actually cut the blocks. the orderer just says if the block is good or not
</p>
<p><strong>sherbetlemon</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:32:10 GMT):<br/>

if its under (2), the (local) peer has already updated the readset with the endorsed transaction, but if it is waiting for (4) it can't commit the block yet, which makes no sense

<p><strong>Maxim_Samarin</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 10:39:59 GMT):<br/>
Hello @sherbetlemon, @nyet, 
Two cents from me regarding Execute call (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/chclient.go#L108) and my investigations on this question.
@sherbetlemon I think you are right and "Execute" responds after tx was committed by peer.
This method calls cc.InvokeHandler (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/chclientrun.go#L35), which uses chain of handlers created by "invoke.NewExecuteHandler()"
By these handlers we can check which operations are done, but the most interesting for us is the last one "NewCommitHandler(next...)" (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/invoke/txnhandler.go#L220)
In its "Handle" method (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/invoke/txnhandler.go#L167) 
we can see that it registers tx event listener (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/invoke/txnhandler.go#L171)
sends tx to orderer (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/invoke/txnhandler.go#L178)
and waits for event (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/invoke/txnhandler.go#L184)
and quits the method only after timeout or event is received.
So per my understanding "Execute" is synchronous method for sending transactions to blockchain. Accordingly if there is a loop of txs to be sent in one thread, each next will wait until previous one has went through the full flow, i.e. committed to blockchain. 
So it seems that with increasing number of txs, time will be increased, i.e. each new will wait for completion of previous transactions. So it seems, that it's necessary to send each tx (call execute) in it's own goroutine (thread). 
Please correct me if I missed something or wrong.

Guys, If i remove an org from a channel using configtxlator, the peers aren't actually unjoined i.e stop processing its blocks and delete associated ledger and state DB.
So,If I plan to add that org again to the channel it gives `Cannot create ledger from genesis block, due to LedgerID already exists`. does anyone have a solution/suggestion  to either of this problem ?

you can shutdown the peer, delete its index and then start it up

but be warned that I never tried it before

so you can try to shutdown the peer, backup the file system

it can reconstruct, given you have the genesis block handy

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=FXfMZuZjkcW3t5y5T) @nyet Hello @nyet  ,

If in this code "RegisterChaincodeEvent" is used as an event that Tx was committed, then you are right. There is no much sense for registering for that, as "Execute" will return only when tx is committed and event is caught by client.
But if you want to know, that specific chaincode was executed, then this listener is correct. Also if after subscription(line 23), but before "Execute" (line 30) another hlf client (any other app) will do call to same chaincode (and his tx was successfully added into chain), listener on line 46 will get event of his "Execute" (not of "Execute from line 30").
Then you should receive second cc event for you tx.
I.e. chaincode listener just receives event that chaincode was successfully executed, but by which Tx specified inside event itself (TxID field).

Per my understanding there are only two actual types of events - "Block" and "Filtered Block". Filtered block is same as "Block", just with truncated data (for example there is no "payload" in it. More details - https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/peer_event_services.html)
So thsese three types of event listeners (which we are able to register by sdk - Block, Tx, Chaincode), just different layers of abstraction, which represent same "physical" event (Block or Filtered Block).
Inside "Block event" there is info about transactions and about chaincodes (which were executed by those transactions).
So client sdk just receives "Block" and "Filtered Block" events. But already inside sdk, if we have registered chaincode listener, sdk will take data about chaincode from "Block event" and if it matches pattern, registered callback will be executed.
Same for tx listener.
This might be visible here for block - https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/v1.0.0-alpha4/pkg/fab/events/service/dispatcher/dispatcher.go#L301
and here for filtered block - https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/v1.0.0-alpha4/pkg/fab/events/service/dispatcher/dispatcher.go#L314
Both handlers for publishing "cc" and "tx" events use same "publishFilteredBlockEvents".
I.e. sdk receives 1 Block event and 1 Filtered Block event, and depending on registered listeners, decides which callbacks to call(blocks, chaincodes or transactions)
And it seems, that there is no way to get tx event if we are using "Execute". "RegisterTxStatusEvent" requires TxID, which is generated inside "Execute" and returned when method is finished. 
But due to "Execute" itself catches "Tx" event, listener registered after Execute function will fail by timeout. (At least my test works only if tx listener inside "Execute" is disabled)
@troyronda  , is my understanding regarding "Abstraction layers of events" and "inability to subscribe on tx" is correct? Could you help with that please, or point to right person to discuss, thanks.

hi Fabric Developers

just letting you know about the "Hyperledger Fabric Developer" community call (lasts approx 30-60 mins) currently scheduled for  Thursday February 7th 5pm UTC (5pm UK, 12pm ET, 9am PT). 

The plan is to initially host this community call bi-weekly via Zoom webconference and is aimed at :

- helping the worldwide Fabric Developer community grow in their development journey (eg.  developing applications, smart contracts, chaincode,  developing clients, using the SDK etc - eg. whether its NodeJS, Java, Go etc etc) 
- caters for the developer perspective and the developer community.
- help developers understand / hear more about exciting new things in Fabric,eg. features upcoming or work in progress - ie things that appeal to the developer
- to foster more interest, best practices etc in developing with Hyperledger Fabric.  
- opportunity to ask questions of the Fabric team eg. you may have feedback/questions on your experiences developing with Fabric
- to share stuff you've done with the community, eg sample code / sample use cases that others may be interested in

If you wish to share content on a call, just let me know via email direct or DM me on Rocketchat (ID: mahoney1) and I'll put an item on the agenda. Provide the following:
-  the topic (state whether its presentation, or demo etc)
- the full name of the presenter, and 
- approx length of your pitch in minutes

The Zoom webconference ID is https://zoom.us/my/hyperledger.community   and the aim is to grow interest in the Fabric developer ecosystem (this 'Fabric Developer' call clearly has a much broader scope as indicated - feel free to make suggestions too  !). 

The current agenda is shown here -> https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/fabric/Fabric+Developer+-+Meeting+Agendas+

many thanks for your time - feel free to forward this email if you think it is of interest to a colleague.

@Maxim_Samarin Thank you for that excellent explanation. I am bothered by the code though (which I copied from elsewhere) regarding the reuse of "eventInvoke" as `eventID`, since, as you say, another chaincode caller that calls the same function will register for that `eventID`. If it is true that a concurrent caller might get the CC event for another caller (since they use the same `eventID`), does it makes sense for each call to generate a unique `eventID`, or would that not serve any purpose, since 1) `Execute()` blocks (as expected) and 2) the whole rigamarole of waiting for an Event is therefore pointless anyway (unless there was a real reason to do cross-client event waiting for some application specific use?)

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 04 Feb 2019 18:14:12 GMT):<br/>
@Maxim_Samarin Alternately, the other use I can see for that registration code sequence is to trap some sort of time out condition where `Execute()` might succeed but some other (unspecified) problem causes a timeout that can only be detected by waiting for the CC event.

I worked on docker, I don't think docker can be accused of not having defaults.

fyi mockgen has been updated as well, you should not see `(type *gomock.Controller has no field or method T)` anymore since T is now available, but you need to update the mockgen library in vendor.. this is way it's safer to remove the vendor folder then do make all

Hello guys, We started upgrading to 1.4 but since the upgrade we are experiencing lots of latency even in read operations. We are talking about seconds of reading data. This has never happened before on 1.0 or 1.2. It is very curious since executing the same API paths there are some times where there is almost no latency, whereas other we got up to 15 seconds of latency. I do not know if someone has experienced this problem and how did you guys solve it. Attaching the image of the logging of our application.

For a team with language flexibility, is this the recommended SDK? Wondering in light of 1.4 tutorials written for Node and the programming model updates being uncertain for the Go SDK in 2.0 while already being implemented in 1.4 for Node.

</p>
<p><strong>rootDistress</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 05:34:28 GMT):<br/>
I have a situation here, I'm creating dynamic channel and adding orgs, peers to it with overriding endpoint config and using dynamic discovery, however when using discoverPeers (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/768766943cc713f3ffcc439be3d4c99d4f72c6c5/test/integration/e2e/orgs/multiple_orgs_minconfig_test.go#L110) I see it only returns random number of peers in channel and not all of them and retries to reach expected number.

Can someone tell me why that happens? I believe there might be times when the network gets too large and this might fail, Is there a counter method to get peers in channel or even peers of the org that are in channel ?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 12:18:46 GMT):<br/>
@rootDistress check the logs of the peer to see what it returns in response to the discovery queryt
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 12:19:34 GMT):<br/>
you can also try to use the [discovery CLI](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discovery-cli.html) to see if it's a problem in the peer, or in the SDK
</p>
<p><strong>rootDistress</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 12:57:03 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=4eAEjX9biqgkpQNcr) @yacovm Idealy, Should it return all the peers all the time in a query?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 12:59:08 GMT):<br/>
in a peer query? yes.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 12:59:58 GMT):<br/>
note that if you have from some reason - membership changes in the peers - you will see them in the peer logs: "membership changed" or something like that, if you're in v1.4

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=rMkru4gkRJNmkmwbB) @nyet good comment. I can think of a couple reasons it's broke the way it is. Win and Mac are in VMs, so I'll bet there's a specific-to-the-vm config going on there. It looks like compose supports setting the extra_hosts, which is what I'd suggest as a workaround. The last thing, is I'm very concerned that anyone is doing that at all. I don't understand the use case. The containers shouldn't talk to the host.

@phantom.assasin a channel is configured with organizations (MSPs) .. by updating the channel config block, you can add/remove organizations.. peers are managed by the organizations, each org can have as many peers as they want, the number of peers is not managed by the channel

Hey guys, somewhat newbie question, the main app i build using the fabric go sdk which will be responsible for installing chaincode etc, who will hold that? the network admin? does this pose any sort of security issues if private data is being sent over the network can he/they spy on stuff?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 03:59:50 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=nfFgd4oHFskT43FmK) @haardikkk The peer and orderer private tls certificates secure the connections. Anyone who has either key can sniff the data on the wire.
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 04:01:02 GMT):<br/>
understood, so the queries to the blockchain etc will show encrypted data? or are they only for basic blocks/network info and not being able to read information about specific structs being passed around?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 04:03:30 GMT):<br/>
see also TLS and GRPC, sort of beyond the scope of fabric itself.
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 04:03:56 GMT):<br/>
alright, thank you! 
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 04:04:52 GMT):<br/>
im basically concerned that since im learning and working towards building a network where the different peers dont necessarily trust each other, i want to limit access to information as much as possible and keep it secure
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 04:05:07 GMT):<br/>
was worried the network admin could sniff on private data
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 04:05:25 GMT):<br/>
If the network admin has access to any private keys, he can do just that.
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 04:05:46 GMT):<br/>
so you suggest the network admin not be someone who owns a peer node ?
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 04:06:30 GMT):<br/>
is there any way to improve the security around this? i cant imagine a 'overlord' organization fit for my network which would be trusted by all the peers
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 04:06:36 GMT):<br/>
If he owns the peer node he can see anything the peer node can decrypt
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 04:06:42 GMT):<br/>
I don't think you really understand how TLS works :/
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 04:06:51 GMT):<br/>
aaah so only what he can decrypt right
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 04:06:52 GMT):<br/>
thats ok
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 04:07:00 GMT):<br/>
by private data i meant the link you mentioned to me earlier in the morning
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 04:07:06 GMT):<br/>
itll show up encrypted right
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 04:08:13 GMT):<br/>
If the peer is supposed to be able to decrypt the data, then yes, anyone who has access to that peer's private keys can see that data. If th peer's private key is not sufficient to decrypt the data, the peer's private key can't be used by anyone to decrypt it.
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 04:08:25 GMT):<br/>
so when such a peer 'installs chaincode' through the application, does it only install on their node? can he 'invite' other nodes to also update their chaincode to that model or do they have to do it themselves through their apps? (cant find documentation regarding this)
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 04:08:35 GMT):<br/>
I understand that now, thanks for the clarification
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 04:08:54 GMT):<br/>
all peers on the same channel get the same chaincode if they are endorsing peers
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 04:10:02 GMT):<br/>
understood, thanks a lot!
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 04:10:25 GMT):<br/>
NP but i highly suggest you do a bit of TLS and encryption research in general
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 04:10:49 GMT):<br/>
e.g. the difference between what the TLS keys do and what the endorsing keys do...
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 04:13:31 GMT):<br/>
The problem is that Fabric's security model is extremely confusing.. so you may want to back up a bit and look in to some of the more simple systems first.

<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 13:08:48 GMT):<br/>
@Rajatsharma Chaincode api questions are more appropriate for #fabric-chaincode-dev .  The short answer is that chaincode will request result sets in batches of 1000 from couchdb.  If you iterate down to the 1001st record, chaincode will query couchdb for the next 1000. See more details at https://logs.hyperledger.org/production/vex-yul-hyp-jenkins-3/fabric-docs-build-x86_64/1334/html/couchdb_as_state_database.html#couchdb-pagination

Actually I wanted to perform update on those records, that's why I was using `GetQueryResult()`. because `GetQueryResultWithPagination()` is read-only. 
I've done the part to fetch top records but I'm facing some issues as I'm hitting the ledger before the whole data gets committed. So I'm working on that. Still thanks for inputs on both channels. I'll try to se them.

Hi. Can I set the client msp path to use the go sdk? Instead of using the fabric ca for enrolling
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:33:24 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=zubfv7zFmqWaY2tGY) @Jgnuid Yes.
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:34:08 GMT):<br/>
Any idea how? Every example I see involves a yaml defining the CA service...
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:35:46 GMT):<br/>
`client->credentialStore->cryptoStore`
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:36:34 GMT):<br/>
`organizations-><org>->cryptoPath`
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:45:00 GMT):<br/>
@nyet , not sure I understand what do yo mean.
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:45:39 GMT):<br/>
Do you mean setting up the path by code?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:46:01 GMT):<br/>
@Jgnuid No, in `config.yaml`
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:51:48 GMT):<br/>
Oh ok. So then in cryptopath I should put the msp path that contains the MSP of the client, which contains the signcerts and keystore folders, right?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:51:58 GMT):<br/>
yep
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:52:04 GMT):<br/>
Sorry. Cryptostore
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:52:10 GMT):<br/>
no path, not store
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:52:15 GMT):<br/>
In cryptopath there aren't krystores
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:52:19 GMT):<br/>
store is for enrollment
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:54:28 GMT):<br/>
Cryptostore.path  will contain keystore folder.
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:54:33 GMT):<br/>
Right.
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:55:19 GMT):<br/>
The paths of the msp in the organization sections are only x509 of the CAs... No keys there. Right?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:56:17 GMT):<br/>
The MSP generally has 4 subdirs, each with a single file
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:56:50 GMT):<br/>
err 5
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:56:54 GMT):<br/>
Yeah.. but only in the cryptostore msp there should be the keystore folder
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:57:07 GMT):<br/>
yea
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:57:13 GMT):<br/>
Because for other orgs I don't have them
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:57:14 GMT):<br/>
Cool
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:57:15 GMT):<br/>
keystore is the only private key
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:57:19 GMT):<br/>
the other 4 have pems
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:57:27 GMT):<br/>
Excellent
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:58:18 GMT):<br/>
Another quick question... Does fabric consider expiration dates of certs? Should I care in 5 years of renewing the CA certs? 
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 03:58:24 GMT):<br/>
That would be painful
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 04:52:28 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that is a big problem with fabric: distributing new keys. No clue how to go about it, maybe somebody else can chime in.

Hello
</p>
<p><strong>donamKim</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 05:07:44 GMT):<br/>
Is there a way to create a FabricSDK instance without a config.yaml file?
</p>
<p><strong>donamKim</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 05:11:06 GMT):<br/>
When a fabric network is fully deployed, is there a way to access it with only url in fabric-sdk-go?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 05:14:32 GMT):<br/>
Yes config.yaml can be empty now
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 05:14:59 GMT):<br/>
Not all of the defaults make sense still though.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 05:15:10 GMT):<br/>
I have been working towards it.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 05:15:44 GMT):<br/>
But you can do everything via environment variables or command line arguments; you'll just have to set up your code to do so.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 05:16:15 GMT):<br/>
you still need (minimally) orderer, peer, MSP though.
</p>
<p><strong>donamKim</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 05:23:00 GMT):<br/>
I don`t understand what you mean. Can you show me the example config.yaml file you mentioned?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 05:43:25 GMT):<br/>
I mean you can have an empty one
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 05:43:41 GMT):<br/>
and fill in the config in code instaead, based on command line or getenv()

</p>
<p><strong>rootDistress</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 06:36:36 GMT):<br/>
@nyet To add to that question, In case we use endpoint config and identity config to dynamically change the channel config etc, Is there a way to get back the config in situation the process running main.go crashes?

</p>
<p><strong>donamKim</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 06:49:11 GMT):<br/>
@nyet  Can you explain specifically what it says to type the command line?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 06:49:56 GMT):<br/>
@donamKim No, i mean in your own go program you can parse command line options, build a config, and instantate a sdk
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 06:50:17 GMT):<br/>
@rootDistress No, that doesn't seem to be possible afaik

Hi! I have several questions:
1. Why on Go SDK is not listed in SDK list here https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fabric-sdks.html ? What is current status of the project?
2. So far i found two good examples of SDK usage. SecureKey CLI client, with great coverage of functionality, but a bit hard to understand right away, because of using a lot of abstraction and cobra related structures. And Chainhero tutorial, witch is pretty basic, but great for start. Is there any other good examples?
3. What about documentation, i guess it is still in plans and not published anywhere?
Thanks in advance!

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 16:50:18 GMT):<br/>
@AVK it isn't listed mostly because there is no documentation to link to, maybe :/ You can look at my simple app for an example  https://github.com/Blockdaemon/hlf-database-app

<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:26:59 GMT):<br/>
Question:
When doing .sdk.ChannelContext() I get an error "user not found".
In the yaml, in "client"->"cryptoconfig"->"path", I have the full path of the folder that has the cryptomaterial

In "organizations"->"myOrg"->"cryptoPath", I have the relative path to the 'msp' folder of the client.

What might I be doing wrong?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:35:50 GMT):<br/>
@Jgnuid have you tried to add the {username} dynamic variable as in this path for your org? https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/config/config_e2e.yaml#L261 ... user not found is usually the crypto material folder doesn't have the user your connecting with or your not passing a user 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:36:45 GMT):<br/>
we usually pass in the user to the context as in this example: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/e2e/end_to_end.go#L101
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:37:01 GMT):<br/>
Yes, in fact my cryptopath is literally: peerOrganizations/myorg.com/users/{userName}@myorg.com/msp
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:37:37 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=26p8y2jhaifLorAuT) @mtng wallets are not supported by Go SDK (for now), it's a Node SDK concept as per the docs
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:39:32 GMT):<br/>
@Jgnuid did you use `fabsdk.WithUser("yourUserID")` when creating the client context?
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:40:14 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk , yes.
Additionally,  if I concatenate cryptoconfig.path and cryptoPath to get the full path, and I paste it in the vm and do 'cd PASTEHERE', the folder really exists (changing {userName} to the user I want to use)
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:40:15 GMT):<br/>
for instance `fabsdk.WithUser("Admin")` can be passed
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:42:15 GMT):<br/>
under that crypto path for your org, do you have a folder called `users`?
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:43:13 GMT):<br/>
mm in cryptopath ?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:44:16 GMT):<br/>
`"organizations"->"myOrg"->"cryptoPath"`
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:45:29 GMT):<br/>
or this relative path from what you pasted earlier : `peerOrganizations/myorg.com/`
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:45:50 GMT):<br/>
there should be a folder called users and in it folders for each user
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:45:59 GMT):<br/>
There I have: 'cacerts', 'IssuerPublicKey', 'IsserrevocationpublicKey', 'keystore', 'signcerts', and 'user'
But the 'user' folder is empty.
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:46:12 GMT):<br/>
But the cryptoPath has the username in its path
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:46:19 GMT):<br/>
is the msp for the user
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:46:27 GMT):<br/>
why should have things in 'user'?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:46:32 GMT):<br/>
ie folder like `Admin@myorg.com`
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:46:48 GMT):<br/>
not user, `users`
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:46:56 GMT):<br/>
No.. that folder isn't there.
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:47:13 GMT):<br/>
But lookin in your example:
cryptoPath: peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/{username}@org1.example.com/msp

The cryptoPath is already into the users folder
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:48:02 GMT):<br/>
Maybe I'm thinking something wrong.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:48:08 GMT):<br/>
you can run `make integration-tests` and see the msp structure generated under `fabric-sdk-go/test/fixtures/fabric/v1/crypto-config`
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:49:12 GMT):<br/>
Sorry, I understanded your question wrong.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:49:22 GMT):<br/>
in it, you can find the relative path for `Admin` and `User1` folders (as per the config under: `peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/{username}@org1.example.com/msp`)
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:49:22 GMT):<br/>
in it, you can find the relative path for `Admin@org1.example.com` and `User1@org1.example.com` folders (as per the config under: `peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/{username}@org1.example.com/msp`)
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:49:55 GMT):<br/>
Yes... I've already checked that the folder really exists
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:50:17 GMT):<br/>
In peerOrganizations/myorg.com/, I have the users folder
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:50:42 GMT):<br/>
what are user folders do you have in there?
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:51:12 GMT):<br/>
admin@myorg.com
Only that folder
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:51:29 GMT):<br/>
fabsdk.WithUser("admin") is how I configured it in code
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:52:13 GMT):<br/>
ok, then this should be good .. does admin@myorg.com have `msp` and `tls` folders
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:52:59 GMT):<br/>
Yes, both.
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:53:21 GMT):<br/>
And into msp, I have: cacerts  IssuerPublicKey  IssuerRevocationPublicKey  keystore  signcerts  user
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:53:42 GMT):<br/>
msp has keystore and a private key in it?
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:53:45 GMT):<br/>
The only 'weird' thing is that into 'user' there's nothing. Is that a problem?
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:54:04 GMT):<br/>
yes, 'keystore' folder has the private keys
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:54:34 GMT):<br/>
what is the path of 'user' you're referring to?
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:57:13 GMT):<br/>
The path is /peerOrganizations/myorg.com/users/admin@myorg.com/msp
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:57:51 GMT):<br/>
under this path, there should be no 'user' folder
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:57:59 GMT):<br/>
only 'tls' and 'msp'
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:58:22 GMT):<br/>
the 'user' folder is in /peerOrganizations/myorg.com/users/admin@myorg.com/msp
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:58:26 GMT):<br/>
not in '/peerOrganizations/myorg.com/users/admin@myorg.com
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:58:45 GMT):<br/>
in /peerOrganizations/myorg.com/users/admin@myorg.com there is only msp and tls
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:59:11 GMT):<br/>
under msp there should be admincerts, cacerts, keystore, signcerts and tlscacerts
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:59:18 GMT):<br/>
this is the standard msp structure
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 18:59:50 GMT):<br/>
yes, that's the structure.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:01:01 GMT):<br/>
when you said `The only 'weird' thing is that into 'user' there's nothing. Is that a problem?` do you mean the msp folder is empty?
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:01:27 GMT):<br/>
No, I mean that the 'user' folder into 'msp' is empty. Which I guess is ok because the 'user' folder in that folder isn't neccessary 
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:01:32 GMT):<br/>
(it was generate by the ca)
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:01:52 GMT):<br/>
or you mean the username `user@myorg.com`  is not created?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:02:08 GMT):<br/>
yes, the CA generates it
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:02:33 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:02:38 GMT):<br/>
All seems OK
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:03:01 GMT):<br/>
I hope I don't have to lookup the code and print some kind of path that the code is looking for... just to check what it's trying to do

if you want more users, then you have tell the CA create more users, you can do that in the cryptogen.yaml file then run the cryptogen cli command again, so the Go SDK example here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/fixtures/fabric/v1/config/cryptogen.yaml#L21

<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:24:11 GMT):<br/>
But I don't want more users... still looking for the problem
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:25:34 GMT):<br/>
`(it was generate by the ca)` it is weird, the Go SDK's example doesn't generate a 'user' folder under msp, what version of Fabric are you using?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:27:55 GMT):<br/>
also can you try `fabsdk.WithUser("Admin")` (instead of `fabsdk.WithUser("admin")`) ?
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:30:52 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk , the CA is 1.3
I tried with "Admin", but have the same problem.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:32:34 GMT):<br/>
gryptogen should be the same though... only peerOrganizations have 'users' folder, the underlying peers/users msp folders don't have 'user'
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:33:53 GMT):<br/>
your value of `"client"->"cryptoconfig"->"path"` points to the full path of the crypto-config folder, right?
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:34:05 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:34:31 GMT):<br/>
also, the reason why I asked for 'Admin' instead of 'admin' is because the ca creates it with a capital 'A'
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:34:39 GMT):<br/>
In that path, is where is the 'peerOrganizations' folder 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:34:48 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:34:49 GMT):<br/>
yes.. I understood that you wanna try that
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:37:46 GMT):<br/>
mmm
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:38:06 GMT):<br/>
the pem filename under signcerts should comply a particular format?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:39:39 GMT):<br/>
it's standard format as well... I was gonna ask, under users/Admin@myorg.com/msp/signcerts... do you have the cert file named as `Admin@myorg.com-cert.pem` ?
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:40:24 GMT):<br/>
Damn, that was the problem
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:40:49 GMT):<br/>
yes.. this is how the SDK loads the cert in order to create the user identity
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:41:18 GMT):<br/>
this is why we follow the CA's structure to the letter
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:41:38 GMT):<br/>
Well but there's a problem
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:41:46 GMT):<br/>
I used the fabric-ca-client
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:41:52 GMT):<br/>
and it named that file cert.pem
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:42:16 GMT):<br/>
weird.. the examples use the cryptogen cli command
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:42:28 GMT):<br/>
yeah, maybe cryptogen does it correctly
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:42:36 GMT):<br/>
But the Fabric CA not..
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:42:39 GMT):<br/>
i cant believe it :/
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:42:54 GMT):<br/>
you have another option, by embedding the cert directly in the config
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:43:12 GMT):<br/>
I didn't know that was possible
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:43:15 GMT):<br/>
and what about the keys?
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:43:57 GMT):<br/>
can I put both the cert and privkey in pem format in the yaml?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:45:44 GMT):<br/>
one sec.. let me double check..
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:50:01 GMT):<br/>
actually yes... you should be able to use the `users` tag instead of `cryptoPath in your config.yaml`, like this:
    ```users:
      Admin:
        key:
          pem: |
            -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
            YOURKEYHERE
            -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
        cert:
          pem: |
            -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
            YOURCERTHERE
            -----END CERTIFICATE-----```
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:50:01 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:51:35 GMT):<br/>
instead of embedding the key/cert, you can also use `path` instead of `pem` and put in the full path of your cert/key (this is safer than adding a raw private key in your config) 
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:51:35 GMT):<br/>
Err that is crazy. That needs to be fixed
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:52:04 GMT):<br/>
what about just symlinking the pem into the right location
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:52:13 GMT):<br/>
this is an option (if you don't want to use `cryptoPath`)
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:52:42 GMT):<br/>
yes, this is why you can use `path` instead of `pem` 
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:53:55 GMT):<br/>
Now I'm getting an error:
failed constructing descriptor for chaincodes:<name:"mychaincodes" > 

I didn't put all the peers on the yaml, only one that is the one I'm doing the query.

I also see some errors in service.discovery but I think they're not important (I guess).
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:54:38 GMT):<br/>
(I double checked, my chaincode name is 'mychaincodes'.. I can call it using the cli peer chaincode query)
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:57:29 GMT):<br/>
not sure, this comes from Fabric, could be an endorsement policy error or something. If you have multiple peers for your org, I would suggest listing all the peers under the org in the config
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:58:11 GMT):<br/>
Its a query invoke, so the policy shoudn't complain.. gonna add the other peer just to check, but doesnt make much sense for me
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 19:58:27 GMT):<br/>
can I disable discovery in the yaml? Just to be sure isn't producing this
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:01:44 GMT):<br/>
it's ok to get discovery errors at the beginning  as peers are not found etc... it is needed eventually to communicate with the network and discover other orgs/peers on a channel
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:03:21 GMT):<br/>
In the peer I see the error:
2019-02-19 19:56:00.827 UTC [discovery] chaincodeQuery -> ERRO 04e Failed constructing descriptor for chaincode chaincodes:<name:"mychaincodes" > ,: cannot satisfy any principal combination
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:04:57 GMT):<br/>
not sure how you created the CC.. I would say create it through the SDK, then you can query it... I suspect you used another org/credential to create the CC on the peer
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:07:39 GMT):<br/>
can you compare the certs ? 
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:07:52 GMT):<br/>
but why i can query it with peer chaincode query with this user?
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:08:07 GMT):<br/>
and wh yis this error in the [discovery] tag?.. i don't want any discovery
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:08:10 GMT):<br/>
just query the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:09:12 GMT):<br/>
the peer depends on 'discovery' service to sync blocks between the orderer and other (peer) endorsers
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:10:34 GMT):<br/>
you can probably follow the Go SDK end to end example, if you want to create the CC through the SDK: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/e2e/end_to_end.go#L45
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:12:22 GMT):<br/>
I can't recreate the channel, it already has data
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:12:39 GMT):<br/>
moreover, it doesn't seem reasonable why then 'peer chaincode query' works...
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:14:41 GMT):<br/>
can you copy the user cert from the peer into the sdk config?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:14:41 GMT):<br/>
can you copy the user cert and key from the peer into the sdk config?
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:19:15 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk , gotta go now. Later I'll continue.. thanks for your help, was really useful. I'll let you know how I continue

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=fTRk6Z4Bbfv6NLpGb)  @what do you mean depends on? It provides the service, it doesnt depend on it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:26:21 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:30:32 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm I meant, the peer provides the service and uses it as well (just like the SDKs can use it too), isn't this the case?
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:39:51 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm , any idea about my error (not in the pc now, but I can ask :): Failed constructing descriptor for chaincode chaincodes:<name:"mychaincodes" > ,: cannot satisfy any principal combination ?
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:40:12 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm , with 'peer chaincode query' it works ok.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:49:57 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk no, the peer doesnt use service discovery...
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:51:03 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm It's only for external applications?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:53:08 GMT):<br/>
Only for clients
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:53:28 GMT):<br/>
Trust me i know 😁
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:54:25 GMT):<br/>
@Jgnuid you probably dont have anchor peers or didnt confihure external endpoints on the peers
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:55:03 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm i need your opinion on a cryptogen-less deploy. In theory, it should be possible to deploy an entire network by ONLY 1) instantiating a CA server, 2) distributing a) CA pub cert b) CA admin login/password... no other external stuff is needed
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:55:22 GMT):<br/>
is that accurate? adding orderers, peers, clients can all be done via enrollment?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:56:10 GMT):<br/>
I am trying to simplify the workflow from the (silly, imo) crpytogen based examples to something more funcionaly useful
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:57:07 GMT):<br/>
I plan to do this all using the sdk, and possibly configtx, without cryptogen
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:57:25 GMT):<br/>
(and openssl to generate the initial ca/tlsca keypair(s))
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:57:42 GMT):<br/>
Yes it should be possible
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:57:52 GMT):<br/>
OK thanks, just confirming my concept is sound
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:58:02 GMT):<br/>
But....
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:58:19 GMT):<br/>
Separate between your TLS CA and the enrollement CA
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:58:23 GMT):<br/>
Best practice
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:58:26 GMT):<br/>
yea i plan to
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:58:38 GMT):<br/>
so technically, TWO ca pub keys?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:58:43 GMT):<br/>
Aha
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:59:07 GMT):<br/>
or same cert that generaties both key pairs (and distriubte the top CA pubkey)?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 20:59:34 GMT):<br/>
or they should be entirely separate CA roots
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:00:01 GMT):<br/>
Just make 2 CAs
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:00:16 GMT):<br/>
But i'm not an that versed in fabric-CA
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:00:54 GMT):<br/>
ok thats fine, i can work it out. I know i can use a common root and issue intermediate cas for tlsca and hlf itself, but wondering if you have  an opinion if thats ok or not
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:01:11 GMT):<br/>
What you propose would also work.... 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:01:18 GMT):<br/>
It is up to you
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:01:21 GMT):<br/>
ok thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:01:40 GMT):<br/>
its going to be incremental work anyway. intially having separate CA/TLSCA would be smart either way
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:01:57 GMT):<br/>
In your case you will have the same root for both
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:02:03 GMT):<br/>
yep
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:02:18 GMT):<br/>
just not sure which CA to distribute to the varous people
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:02:31 GMT):<br/>
But separate is more secure because you destribute the keys
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:02:39 GMT):<br/>
I'll work it out as I go. Nod.
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:49:18 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm , where I can check the current anchor peers for the orgs?
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:50:24 GMT):<br/>
Because in this channel I added a new org... but I thought that the channel configuration to add the org also setted the anchor peers of that org.
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:50:31 GMT):<br/>
But I guess that's not maybe the case
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:50:49 GMT):<br/>
anchor peers apply to channels, not orgs
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:51:06 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:51:30 GMT):<br/>
but when i added the org to the channel, does it include te anchor peers that where defined in the configtx.yaml?
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:51:49 GMT):<br/>
Because I'm looking at the current configuration of the channel and I dont see any anchor peers fields
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:52:01 GMT):<br/>
adding an org to a channel only has meaning with respect to channel policy, not what peers are anchor peers
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:52:23 GMT):<br/>
well that could explain then my problem with the sdk..
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:52:50 GMT):<br/>
I'm going to try doing a configtxgen with -outputAnchorPeers with the yaml and cross my fingers
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:53:01 GMT):<br/>
sounds reasonable?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:54:01 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=a652a338-c770-459c-abfd-cfdc63a43784) @yacovm so I guess the peers communicate between themselves and the orderer via gossip and provide the discovery service for SDKs/client apps ?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:54:25 GMT):<br/>
@Jgnuid or `-outputAnchorPeersUpdate` 
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:54:32 GMT):<br/>
so, yes :)
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:55:15 GMT):<br/>
and `-asOrg`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:56:50 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk betwern themselves via gossip, but to the orderer directly via the Deliver API
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:57:04 GMT):<br/>
*between
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:57:19 GMT):<br/>
I see.. thanks for clarifying this @yacovm 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 21:59:24 GMT):<br/>
No problem
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 22:01:45 GMT):<br/>
ReadSet: readset expected key [Group]  /Channel/Application at version 1, but got version 2
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 22:01:55 GMT):<br/>
I guess it's beecause I've already updated the channel configuration before

so it isnt correct to generate the outputanchorpeers from the .yaml...
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 22:03:09 GMT):<br/>
Is this the case?
</p>

@nyet , how can I generate the update .tx of the anchorpeers from the current channel configuration? 
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 22:10:26 GMT):<br/>
Damn, configtxgen can't be used... from --help: Creates an config update to update an anchor peer (works only with the default channel creation, and only for the first update)

@yacovm , why in the 'Build your first network' example, it does to updates of anchor peers and doesn't have the problem of versions?
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 22:52:42 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>ShajiThiyarathodi</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 23:14:49 GMT):<br/>
is there an a way to query for a range of blocks on a given channel for a given time frame?
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 00:05:24 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm , @nyet , @Baha-sk , I managed to update the anchor peers when the version is not 1... basically old-school deserialization of protos to json, modify by hand, and re-proto and send update. All great.
Unfortunately (or fortunately, don't know what to say), the error changed when trying to query using the GO SDK:
failed to create new channel client: event service creation failed: could not get chConfig cache reference: QueryBlockConfig failed: target(s) required

Any idea? (I can't believe problems never end :( )
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 00:11:33 GMT):<br/>
Oh, I managed to solve it.. this is was my fault. (After a bunch of millions tests.. )
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 00:23:02 GMT):<br/>
Yep, confirmed. I could successfully queryed the chaincode. Tomorrow gonna try invoking it...but I guess shoudnt be an issue.
Moral of this story:
1) fabric-ca-client didnt name the signcert correctly (as it seems to do cryptogen)
2) Anchors peers where a problem if they weren defined (with a too cryptic message... thanks @yacovm, woudn't be impossible without your hint)
3) the tools doesn't allow to update the anchor peers if the version of the channel configuration is not 1...

Pretty crazy...
</p>
<p><strong>Jgnuid</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 00:24:52 GMT):<br/>
This kind of things makes me wonder using this in production... Thankfully here there are good souls to help us out, but better tools and documentation are urgently needed. Hope in some months I can have some spare time and help with some documentation about this...

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=369d3689-ea45-4453-bd1d-61b447c1fac6) @yacovm This doesn't seem to work. There is no way to tell the ca-server to use a seperate TLSCA for tls signing, it seems to always use `FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CA_KEYFILE`. `FABRIC_CA_SERVER_TLS_KEYFILE` is only for the TLS endpoint, it isn't a ca cert. `FABRIC_CA_SERVER_TLSCA_KEYFILE` doesn't seem to do anything.

</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 03:15:12 GMT):<br/>
it looks like o would have to start a second instance of `ca-server` to sign TLS certs with a different CA
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 04:48:48 GMT):<br/>
Wow digging through this, its baffling. The fabric examples have the ca-server use the peer ca certs for both signging AND tls endpoint?? thats crazy
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 04:49:55 GMT):<br/>
and the *orderer* has the tlsca, but not the ca-server. that is just ... weird
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 05:58:16 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm I can't figure out how to get tls certs from the `ca-server`
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 05:58:24 GMT):<br/>
there is zero documentation anywhere that i can find
</p>
<p><strong>xDxD</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 06:13:57 GMT):<br/>
@nyet  In java sdk ,  like this :   //This shows how to get a client TLS certificate from Fabric CA
                // we will use one client TLS certificate for orderer peers etc.
                final EnrollmentRequest enrollmentRequestTLS = new EnrollmentRequest();
                enrollmentRequestTLS.addHost("localhost");
                enrollmentRequestTLS.setProfile("tls");
                final Enrollment enroll = ca.enroll("admin", "adminpw", enrollmentRequestTLS);
                final String tlsCertPEM = enroll.getCert();
                final String tlsKeyPEM = getPEMStringFromPrivateKey(enroll.getKey());
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 06:14:53 GMT):<br/>
@xDxD Thanks! Which cert will it use to sign it?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 06:15:28 GMT):<br/>
`FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CA_KEYFILE` or `FABRIC_CA_SERVER_TLS_KEYFILE`
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 06:16:38 GMT):<br/>
and is it possible to just use the `fabric-ca-client` binary, or will I have to write code..
</p>
<p><strong>xDxD</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 06:18:48 GMT):<br/>
@nyet Sorry, I am not so used
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 08:42:29 GMT):<br/>
Ah nvm got the `fabric-ca-client` to work. However, it can only sign using `FABRIC_CA_SERVER_CA_KEYFILE`

<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Fri, 22 Feb 2019 03:53:26 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>dave.enyeart</strong> (Fri, 22 Feb 2019 15:36:42 GMT):<br/>
@haardikkk @Jgnuid When key does not exist, ledger returns nil to handleGetState, and handleGetState returns nil to chaincode 
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Fri, 22 Feb 2019 18:51:49 GMT):<br/>
I see, weird naming of variables in there maybe they should check for nil and be more explicit

<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 15:54:50 GMT):<br/>
When using a connection profile, specifying my org, my peers, orderers, my channel.
I want to query a chaincode in the channel that is not installed on my peer (or the policy does not include me/requires more orgs).

Without specifying `channel.WithTargetEndpoints("peer0.otherorg.com:7051")`, I get a
```
Client Status Code: (6) NO_PEERS_FOUND. Description: targets were not provided
```

But shouldn't it be possible for the sdk to use the discovery service and find these peers itself?

Using fabric 1.3.0, anchor peers set for all organizations
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 21:56:31 GMT):<br/>
@Kyroy most probably the discovery service failed for some reason
</p>
<p><strong>Kyroy</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 22:14:07 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk Hmm, I enabled debug logs and cannot find any errors. I also cannot find the peer from the other org.
Discovery service works when using the fabric CLI to query it.

I can also see that the channel config is loaded:
```chconfig.extractConfig -> DEBU loaded channel config: &{id:interop-channel blockNumber:100 msps:[0xc00040a440 0xc00040a840 0xc00040ac40] anchorPeers:[0xc0001d5e90 0xc000414210] orderers:[orderer0.water-chdix.example.com:7050] versions:0xc00030ba60 capabilities:map[:map[V1_1:true] Orderer:map[V1_1:true]]}```
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 15:04:00 GMT):<br/>
@kyroy, that's the channel config, it only stores the anchor peers... you can get the discovery service from the channel service like this: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/e2e/orgs/multiple_orgs_minconfig_test.go#L117 and then do discovery.GetPeers().. 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 15:32:01 GMT):<br/>
@Kyroy also you might wanna double check how Handle() is called in your client as the first check is about verifying at the context's Targets option (it is probably manually by the client, ie the SDK doesn't add Targets on the fly, but it's better to double check your call) : https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/invoke/txnhandler.go#L37

I have a problem and its becoming a real problem. I will appreciate some help. I have a network of 3 orgs with 2 peers per org (thats a total of 6 peers). They are installed on across 3 servers on a docker swarm cluster. I use the overlay network. 

Sometimes, chaincode upgrades (done via the go sdk) works fine on first try. On other times, instantiation times out on 4 peers. It seems to just happen randomly. We usually have to restart the peers multiple times, before it works. Its is really beginning to look like Hyperledger fabric peers are unstable. What do you think is the problem?

@gen_el
I have a similar problem when initializing the blockchain.
I have two organizations with each organization having one endorsing peer. Sometimes it works immediately, sometimes it won’t. I notice that the chaincode is sometimes not immediately initialized on the second peer. And yes, it happens randomly. Checking the status of the containers (via Kitematics on my Mac) I see that the chaincode is not initialized, BUT this will happen after a query. The only thing I can think of, is that the gossiping takes some time; however, I’m also completely in the dark here.

To see what happens, wrap your error in a panic(..).

@gen_el  and @habpygo, thank you for you responses. I have one quick question. When using the node sdk, the connection.json file, which looks fairly simple, is used to start communicating with the chaincode. Why does the go-sdk require more information?

I am attempting to use the fabric sdk with the byfn network. From my understanding chaincode runs in an isolated docker container, so I don't understand how we are able to provide the configuration file to "fabsdk.New(config.FromFile(...))". If anyone is able to direct me in the proper way to give the configuration file to the sdk I would be very grateful!

</p>
<p><strong>vahuja4</strong> (Sun, 03 Mar 2019 14:37:07 GMT):<br/>
@tstonely, the fabsdk has to be provided with the config file which describes your network. So, it should be present in the same vm/machine on which your fabsdk will run. You are not supposed to be fetching the config file from the docker instance. Hope this helps
</p>
<p><strong>vahuja4</strong> (Sun, 03 Mar 2019 14:38:04 GMT):<br/>
In other words, `config.FromFile("path to the config file on the same machine"`)
</p>
<p><strong>tstonely</strong> (Sun, 03 Mar 2019 14:48:31 GMT):<br/>
@vahuja4 Thanks for your reply. So you are saying that the fabric-sdk should not be run as part of the chaincode but instead on it's own machine. I am currently trying to setup the sdk in my chaincode, is this wrong?
</p>
<p><strong>rootDistress</strong> (Sun, 03 Mar 2019 16:09:12 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=dbbiPADCtGMvB4Mg8) @tstonely Yeah, What you're trying to do isn't ideal, better pass the sdk instance as a pointer to the function.

The first time, it is called with my own (configured) peer. The second time with empty targets.

`discovery.GetPeers()` also only returns my own peer.

I initialize the SDK like this.
```
sdk, err := fabsdk.New(config.FromFile(connectionProfile))
```

Hi!

</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 04 Mar 2019 15:19:12 GMT):<br/>
@Kyroy this may be done implicitly when doing fabsdk.New... but can you explicitly add the discovery service option like this: `sdk, err := fabsdk.New(configProvider, fabsdk.WithServicePkg(&DynamicDiscoveryProviderFactory{}))`
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 04 Mar 2019 15:26:00 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=dbbiPADCtGMvB4Mg8) @tstonely the SDK is meant to communicate with a peer and not to be executed within the peer. It is usually created in a client app that invokes some chaincode queries or executes transactions on a channel where multiple orgs (each with 1 or more peers) participate. You can see the SDK as being used in the client app that talks to the Fabric network. The client app is usually not part of the network.

Hi, I was looking through way data is stored in each peer and orderer docker container, and found much of everything stored in `/var/hyperledger/production/`. My question is as the ledgerData is stored here in case of peer, is there a way to use this to manipulate and unjoin a peer from a specific channel instead of pruning and unjoining from all channels.

Is entity matchers necessary for hlf applications? Like docker creates the containers on `localhost` so, is there a way to not use a workaround like entity matchers to map it but instead use the actual endpoint like `peer0.org1.example.com` or any other solution.

<p><strong>vignesh</strong> (Wed, 13 Mar 2019 14:50:43 GMT):<br/>
Hello everyone,

I am trying to build a dynamic blockchain network where organizations can join or leave the network on the fly.
To achieve it, I am referring to examples at "fabric-sdk-go/test/integration/e2e/configless" directory where I think
networks are dynamic and not locked to predefined set of organizations specified in config files.

In such a scenario (dynamic network) I want to know the following:
1)what information should be provided in genesis block?
2)Is it enough if I have only ordering service info in genesis block as all participant organizations may not be present initially??
2)Is it ok to not have any information of participant organizations in genesis bock??

Kindly  help :)
Thanks,
Vignesh

Interestingly, I am working on the same issue. The `cryptogen`-generates-everything model might be wonderful for a demo, but for a real network, it is appallingly inappropriate. What is needed is the bare minimum necessary to start up an orderer, yet the example `configtx.yaml` is a huge maximalist mess that includes everything but the ktichen sink (much like every other hlf yaml file). What I need is a minimal, functioning, `configtx.yaml` that has the bare minimum: 1) ca root/intermediate pub certs 2) admin pub cert 3) policy 4) tls key pair. I have yet to make one that works.

While setting up the hlf network on local machine, I couldn't get the chaincode to instantiate with `CORE_PEER_CHAINCODELISTENADDRESS = peer0.org2.example.com:7052` but had to use a wildcardIP like `0.0.0.0:7052`. However, I had used the same `peer0.org2.example.com:7052` to set the listening address on docker swarm and it had worked there. Can someone please explain why is this so ?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 15 Mar 2019 10:07:24 GMT):<br/>
Because the local machine doesnt know what is that address

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Sat, 16 Mar 2019 05:39:17 GMT):<br/>
Generally, you should not use a hostname for listen address. Use a know interface's address, localhost, or 0.0.0.0

I don't see one in fabric-sdk-go. I thought this policy is very important and holds the integrity of a chaincode. What's the point of all the ACL and other restrictions if one can upgrade the cc with a newer version.

Hi, I have situation I need clarification about, If in a channel I have 2 orgs initially(org1,org2) and have a chaincode instantiated with version 0 having endorsement policy of OR b/w both orgs.
Later I removed both the orgs and added new 2 org(org3,org4) and wanted to upgrade the same chaincode on them. Wouldn't i just change the endorsement policy, increase version and `upgradeCC` with admin of one of the new orgs ? 
I had got `instantiation policy violation: signature set did not satisfy policy`. I have verified it is the admin making this upgrade.

also, could be that you need to add a mapping for peer0 and peer1's urls in `/etc/hosts` file like this for example: ```127.0.0.1	peer1.org1.example.com peer1.org2.example.com``` this should match your docker name

from the docker ps command you showed earlier, there is no peer configured with port 6151, or is the list not complete?

@Baha-sk By the way, earlier I had path as `CryptoPath: "ordererOrganizations/orderer/msp"` and credentials at `"ordererOrganizations/orderer/msp"` .  msp was right where it was specified in config. So, Is it mandatory to have msp for each user as {user}@example.com ?? If not , my earlier path should be fine and have no issues..

<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 21:06:44 GMT):<br/>
yes @vignesh each user has its own msp folder.. 
</p>

``` 
In this case I tried to do a query into the chaincode1 and chaincode 2 and they are not instantiated.
I have in the configuration a timeout of 60s in the query (by default is 180s):
```
 timeout:

I can catch the error from the timeout but I have this loop in my server logs, how can I fix that?

Hello guys, can anyone help on dynamic service discovery? Currently when I use dynamic discovery, it seems the peer will be discovered even if it is not joined into application channel
</p>
<p><strong>xixuejia</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 08:19:42 GMT):<br/>
I suspect by default the discovery service will only load peers from local connection profile, is there a way to dynamically discover the peer group given channel name and cc name?
</p>

@xixuejia for discovery of peers not on a channel (local peers), there is a simple test: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/pkg/client/common/discovery/discoveryclient_test.go#L108
for discovery of peers on a channel, you need to make sure the peers have joined a channel and chaincodes are installed/instantiated (the test has a bit of prep work to set all things up, but technically the discovery client call is similar to the test above) see: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/pkg/client/common/discovery/discoveryclient_test.go#L44, note the difference is the channelID being passed at this line: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/pkg/client/common/discovery/discoveryclient_test.go#L59

That's the only problem I couldn't resolve for days now... Haven't tried your simple way yet, just copying dependencies into chaincode folder for now
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:00:06 GMT):<br/>
@dimm In general I would think that your chaincode code and your client code (which I assume would be using the go sdk) should be separate
</p>
<p><strong>dimm</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:00:16 GMT):<br/>
they are
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:01:01 GMT):<br/>
What are you referring to when you say external dependencies?
</p>
<p><strong>dimm</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:01:27 GMT):<br/>
The libraries not included in standard go package and not present in hyperledger
</p>
<p><strong>dimm</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:01:51 GMT):<br/>
The ones I pull with "go get ./..." or in vendor folder
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:02:09 GMT):<br/>
The vendor directory should work
</p>
<p><strong>dimm</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:02:16 GMT):<br/>
The thing which is automatically building the container for chaincode could do "go get ./..." before building...
Or packer in SDK could also pack the vendor folder in the package
</p>
<p><strong>dimm</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:02:20 GMT):<br/>
No, it doesn't
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:02:43 GMT):<br/>
The SDK is not involved with the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:03:11 GMT):<br/>
In regards to the vendor folder, you should be packaging your whole repository, not just the package with the chaincode main
</p>
<p><strong>dimm</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:03:12 GMT):<br/>
SDK has packer, which deploys chaincode. And after looking at it's code I didn't find a way to pack the vendor folder
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:03:50 GMT):<br/>
Oh I see what you are hitting now. I didn't catch you were using the SDK to deploy the chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:04:00 GMT):<br/>
Are you not able to specify the whole repository path to pack?
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:04:11 GMT):<br/>
This is a part of the SDK I am not familiar with
</p>
<p><strong>dimm</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:04:34 GMT):<br/>
I'm specifying the folder, but it's filtering out only the files in one top folder

This one
</p>
<p><strong>dimm</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:05:11 GMT):<br/>
And I'm not aware of a simpler way to deploy chaincode, let's say, in basic-network example
</p>
<p><strong>dimm</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:05:34 GMT):<br/>
There's some manual multi-step way to create a package..
</p>
<p><strong>dimm</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:06:42 GMT):<br/>
I'm up for any way to minimize the time between testing iterations while developing, and this seems to be the easiest
</p>
<p><strong>dimm</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:06:58 GMT):<br/>
Except no imports..
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:09:04 GMT):<br/>
What do you specify as the chaincode path?
</p>
<p><strong>dimm</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:09:50 GMT):<br/>
The path to the chaincode project, with sources, binary and vendor
</p>
<p><strong>dimm</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:09:50 GMT):<br/>
```ChaincodeGoPath="/Users/dimm/go"

</p>

</p>
<p><strong>dimm</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:11:52 GMT):<br/>
Should ChaincodeGoPath be the actual project path?
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:12:32 GMT):<br/>
I think you have it correct
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 00:12:54 GMT):<br/>

@Baha-sk How does the dynamic service discovery really work? a client get peers in a channel from orderer? a client has to start somewhere, what is the flow? Can you point me to the doc? Thanks

<p><strong>xixuejia</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 01:03:07 GMT):<br/>
Hi @yacovm  does fabric-sdk-go follow that flow?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 01:03:16 GMT):<br/>
they don't have much of a choice

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 01:14:50 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm thanks a lot for the link. I have read that couple of times, still not sure how a client get started. it says a client uses the discovery service, it also says the discovery service runs on a peer, if that is true, it seems to me that a client still will have to have a peer endpoint to start the whole process, is that right?

why do I need a fabric config to `peer chaincode package`?
</p>
<p><strong>xixuejia</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 08:25:37 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk Thanks for your information about service discovery. But the test you pointed is using internal packages which are not for end developers. Is there a doc for end developers to follow?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 08:44:40 GMT):<br/>
@tongli that is correct. a client is bootstrapped with a peer
</p>
<p><strong>rootDistress</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 12:38:43 GMT):<br/>
If a peer (peer0) is part of two channels (ch1, ch2) and both the channel wants to use chaincode(cc0), Then would there be two docker containers of peer0 with cc0? If not how does this work?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 12:45:02 GMT):<br/>
no, only 1 container @rootDistress

@Baha-sk  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/fab/discovery/discovery.go#L61 this `Send` method requires a param of type github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/internal/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/discovery/client which is internal to fabric-sdk-go. In my application, I could not import the internal package because of error `use of internal package not allowed` . Would you please help on this? Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 14:32:52 GMT):<br/>
good point @xixuejia, the reason the client is in internal is the fact that it's already in Fabric and it's only used internally within the SDK, you probably don't need to use the pinned version in Go SDK, you can get the Fabric version of the discovery client directly, the path is already included in the type, ie: "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/discovery/client " .. so I suggest not using the Go SDK's pinned version for discovery and use the original one in Fabric
</p>
<p><strong>xixuejia</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 15:04:54 GMT):<br/>
thanks @Baha-sk Then there will be a new issue that the golang will complain the type in fabric and fabric-sdk-go internal are different. it will fail at compile stage

</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 15:48:32 GMT):<br/>
@xixuejia if you use the Fabric version of the client, do not mix it with the Go SDK code, use it standalone
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 15:49:51 GMT):<br/>
Go SDK does discovery automatically for you when you get a new configured SDK instance

Hi All, How to get the currentHash and PreviousHash from the QueryBlock using golang
</p>
<p><strong>rootDistress</strong> (Fri, 29 Mar 2019 07:26:06 GMT):<br/>
Hi, I'm still a bit confused. If a peer is part of multiple channels which use the same chaincode of different versions, would I be required to reinstall the same chaincode with ealier version(say 0, that's already installed to instantiate on a different channel)? Would it not complain the chaincode already exists? 
OR would I have to look at the peers and install the chaincode with a different name/version than the one that already exists.
Also, Please point me to a doc if this case is documented somewhere.

@xixuejia probably this example helps: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/e2e/orgs/multiple_orgs_minconfig_test.go#L39 ... but you have to know that peers of an org cannot discovered peers of another org if the orgs are not sharing channels.. so you need to have a channel created using a channel config that has the list of orgs and you also need to apply anchor peers configs for each org .. see the createChannel function in the same package as an example of creating a channel and configuring its anchor peers: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/e2e/orgs/multiple_orgs_test.go#L307.. once the channel is created this way, DisocverService will be able to find peers of other orgs within the channel

hello, im starting using fabric-sdk-go following this tutorial, https://chainhero.io/2018/03/tutorial-build-blockchain-app-2/   ..  Im really new to hyperledger and blockchain and I cant understand yet the native examples in the facbric-sdk-go examples so I followed this. However, this tutorial used an outdated commit ( git checkout 614551a752802488988921a730b172dada7def1d) in the example and I want to use the current master branch (which is updatedf and the result of your hardwork).. But the api folder is missing in  git checkout 614551a752802488988921a730b172dada7def1d .. Where can I read or see the changes done ? ..

If that isn't `MASTER` you need a complete `config.yaml` or you have to set up a config in code.

Is there work going on the Go version of the fabric commercial-paper sample?  I guess that if it is implemented in Go, it would use something similar to the abac chaincode to control the security based on attributes in the client certificate.  Similar to the JavaScript version of this sample, it would need a client wallet to store the client identities. Is there already similar APIs for the client wallet in Go?  Thanks.

<p><strong>integrated.xtal</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:28:48 GMT):<br/>
very hard to follow fabric-samples with golang-sdk .. Not even a single tutorial online (chainhero heroservice tutorial is outdated) .. Im starting to love golang but with such low community huhuhu
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:38:10 GMT):<br/>
@integrated.xtal there are different clients in the Go SDK, depends on what you want to do.. look at the code for those different clients: 
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/tree/master/pkg/client
the integration tests in the Go SDK also provide examples to test these clients: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/tree/master/test/integration/pkg/client
if you want a full end to end scenario, you'd have to follow the code in this folder, it could look a bit heavy (due to prep needed to start/configure a Fabric network including channels, etc) , but the tests themselves are somewhat straightforward, look at code in: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/tree/master/test/integration/e2e

is there any reason for limiting Go to 1.11.6? 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:39:07 GMT):<br/>
I'm using go 1.12 because 1.11 was broken on mac
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:39:14 GMT):<br/>
Go SDK runs on 1.12 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:39:43 GMT):<br/>
the ci.properties limit to 1.11.6 though
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:40:02 GMT):<br/>
so make doesn't pass the version check
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:40:20 GMT):<br/>
hold on a sec.. there should be an error somewhere..
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:42:07 GMT):<br/>
I'm doing a fix, if it works, I'll push a patch @lehors 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:42:19 GMT):<br/>
sounds good
</p>
<p><strong>integrated.xtal</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:42:47 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk yes, but for very beginner in hlf (like me), its very confusing what and where to start.. Also the fabric-samples examples with sdk all uses fabric-node which is very disappointing since it is nice to go full stack with golang chaincode with no javascript .. Sir can you make a simple guide even the balance-transfer example sir.. I really dont want to use fabric-sdk-node
</p>
<p><strong>integrated.xtal</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:43:49 GMT):<br/>
@Baha-sk  I want to do is create a chaincode in golang, and access or expose it in web rest api.. I read that I need an sdk to do that thats why I decided to go with go-sdk
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:47:04 GMT):<br/>
@integrated.xtal You can look at my repos too, but i'm in the process of transitioning to not using `cryptogen` 
* https://github.com/Blockdaemon/hlf-service-network
* https://github.com/Blockdaemon/hlf-database-app
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:47:29 GMT):<br/>
i'm doing that in an entirely seprate project so i'm not sure if i will backport to those (yet)
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:47:42 GMT):<br/>
@integrated.xtal how many orgs/peers are you planning to have in your network? you will need to create a channel, then instantiate and install a CC .. you need to have Fabric basic knowledge first.. the tests have example for all of this
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:50:45 GMT):<br/>
resmgmt client is the one that does the administrative actions  in the network, like creating your CCs
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:51:19 GMT):<br/>
see this function as an example: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/e2e/orgs/multiple_orgs_test.go#L163
</p>
<p><strong>integrated.xtal</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:52:47 GMT):<br/>
yes @Baha-sk , will decide the actual orgs/peers later.. All I need for now is to have a working prototype to convince my team to go with golang-sdk
</p>
<p><strong>integrated.xtal</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:53:24 GMT):<br/>
@nyet sir, why theres some python code you used sir?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:56:12 GMT):<br/>
jinja
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:56:21 GMT):<br/>
for templating outside of ansible/docker/etc
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:56:50 GMT):<br/>
because fabric has gigantic confusing configuration files with zero sane defaults
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:56:56 GMT):<br/>
that all have to be exhaustively generated
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:57:23 GMT):<br/>
and the bizarre behavior of actually writring out their own config files, which is something i have never seen outside of windows apps lol
</p>
<p><strong>integrated.xtal</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 15:59:51 GMT):<br/>
@nyet I see you forked a project from chainhero, that was really to be a good tutorial, only that it is outdated with the fabric-sdk-go version..
</p>
<p><strong>integrated.xtal</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:00:21 GMT):<br/>
and the api folders are not anymore compatible with the current go-sdk (master branch)
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:01:43 GMT):<br/>
 I gave up on that tutorial
</p>
<p><strong>integrated.xtal</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:02:21 GMT):<br/>
me too haha, 
</p>
<p><strong>integrated.xtal</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:03:05 GMT):<br/>
can you revive it brother? I mean I see you are very good with hlf .. I'll help you maintain it hehe
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:03:25 GMT):<br/>
"very good" is not the words i would use.. i'm slowly learning :)
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:04:12 GMT):<br/>
if i get to it i will, its a huge enough job to transistion away from `cryptogen`
</p>
<p><strong>integrated.xtal</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:05:41 GMT):<br/>
why you transition away to cryptogen? most of the fabri network in fabric-samples use it
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:09:08 GMT):<br/>
It's only supposed to be for testing/CI/PoC, not for production
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:10:42 GMT):<br/>
There's an open gerrit PR in fabric that adds proper "operations" docs that use ca-server to get creds rather than pregenerating thm all up front
</p>
<p><strong>integrated.xtal</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:10:42 GMT):<br/>
ahh, what should be used then for production sir?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:11:00 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>integrated.xtal</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:18:38 GMT):<br/>

ya i hear you
</p>
<p><strong>integrated.xtal</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:19:05 GMT):<br/>
and the fabric-samples, they are all implemented with node-sdk
</p>
<p><strong>integrated.xtal</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:19:14 GMT):<br/>
why no go-sdk hahaha
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:19:18 GMT):<br/>
omg ya that is SUPER frustrating to me

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:19:23 GMT):<br/>
:/
</p>
<p><strong>integrated.xtal</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:19:46 GMT):<br/>
as in SUPERR .. maybe if its just in the docs, they it will be easier to adopt
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:20:14 GMT):<br/>
fyi, node sdk has a different team than go sdk
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:20:52 GMT):<br/>
and it's all community related... you're more than welcome to contribute to Go SDK
</p>
<p><strong>integrated.xtal</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:21:07 GMT):<br/>
yes sir I know, were disappointed why the hyperledger team just considered only node-sdk
</p>
<p><strong>integrated.xtal</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:21:30 GMT):<br/>
but how can we contribute to go sdk if the fundamentals (like in the fabric-samples) are not given :/
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:21:32 GMT):<br/>
well there is a lot of inertia there
</p>
<p><strong>integrated.xtal</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:21:54 GMT):<br/>
honestly I will be doing a lot of medium tutorials once I understand this stuff HAHAH
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:22:17 GMT):<br/>
front end people are all node/js, backend guys just moved to go first 
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:22:36 GMT):<br/>
so honestly its not a bash on the fabric devs
</p>
<p><strong>integrated.xtal</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 16:22:50 GMT):<br/>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=fFmND68smKr6x8Mkd) @lehors unfortunately Fabric does not support 1.12 right now, we will upgrade Go SDK once Fabric moves to go 1.12.. it is not a simple config change unfortunately in Go SDK (I would have pushed a patch otherwise), it will be done in the near future though

A related question, is it 'safe' to store other users certs/keys which are not your organization? Example, this application im building its for the organization `fftxmsp` and will be communicating to it's peers, I am confused why I need MSP/pem certs/keys for the other 2 `bankxmsp` and `bankymsp` organizations

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 18:58:18 GMT):<br/>

I am using fabric Go sdk in configless approach. I am referring to files at `fabric-sdk-go/test/integration/e2e/configless` directory.
I have changed file `fabric-sdk-go/test/integration/e2e/configless/endpointconfig_override.go` as per my dirtectory structure.

@vignesh can you add fmt.println statements in your code to display the full path of your store/keys/certs?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 19:03:40 GMT):<br/>
also, adding Admin@orderer.com-cert.pem and the SKI all in one folder might not work, you need an MSP directory structure

Sure @Baha-sk , I will give that info.  debugging with delve, i saw that error is from fabric-sdk-go/internal/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bccsp/sw/fileks.go line 264

<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 19:06:56 GMT):<br/>
make sure to use a directory structure similar to "fabric-sdk-go/test/fixtures/fabric/v1/crypto-config" (run `make integration-tests` for this folder to be generated)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=jPkJTmLw43efAtA5z) @Baha-sk I could see that with my code/configs sdk always tried to access certificates from `clientconfig.CredentialStore` rather than msp of the entity. So, I copied the certificates from crypto-config directory to my `clientconfig.CredentialStore`.
You could see my `clientconfig.CredentialStore` at `https://github.com/vigneshkm/my_fabric_1/blob/master/endpointconfig_override.go` line 86.

@lehors @Baha-sk The CI scripts are running v1.15.0. I'm looking at using gobin to run a consistent version (like fabric-cli project has).

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=g87cyvFEJGXy2RXDm) @vignesh `clientconfig.CredentialStore` is not the problem as this is a temporary location where the SDK will create a cred store to use for the SDK... you need to make sure to pass in the right credentials for your orgs/peers, etc. as per the configless tes, see the following lines as an example:

if you get the makefile set to checkout a specific version, we'll steal that bit, eventually.

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 19:58:01 GMT):<br/>
make depend currently does that

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 19:58:33 GMT):<br/>
but I'm looking at changing to use the gobin mechanism instead.

<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 19:59:05 GMT):<br/>
what is "the gobin mechanism" keep referring to that

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=dDwjwqfyYkmncu2k8) @dimm adding a user to an org must follow the same msp directory structure... similarly to https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=tPE3y3LJooSveCE9E.. look at how users are set 
</p>
<p><strong>dimm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 20:41:01 GMT):<br/>
When I enrolled a user, it outputted:

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 20:42:09 GMT):<br/>
You need the private half of signcerts in keystore

One of those?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 20:47:36 GMT):<br/>
the sdk already looks in msp/keystore if you configured an MSP directory for an identity
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 20:48:09 GMT):<br/>
that is the keystore for THAT MSP (no relation to the local keystore that  the sdk uses for itself)
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 20:48:19 GMT):<br/>
(I know it is confusing, trust me)
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 20:48:57 GMT):<br/>
those look like the server private keys
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 20:49:12 GMT):<br/>
you want the keys written out to your own keystore when you run the ca-client
</p>
<p><strong>dimm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 20:49:18 GMT):<br/>
Mmm... It is :) So do I understand correctly that instead of using ADmin user, like for all other operations, I need to enroll a new user in CA, copy it's cert to SDK, and use that one for registering users?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 20:49:26 GMT):<br/>
you dont HAVE to
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 20:49:31 GMT):<br/>
you can use the admin to enroll everyone
</p>
<p><strong>dimm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 20:49:37 GMT):<br/>
Can I simply use the REST service somehow?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 20:49:39 GMT):<br/>

so the `certificateAuthorties` section is for the fabric-ca-client BUILT IN to the SDK, you can use that instead of `fabric-ca-client` stand alone tool
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 21:01:25 GMT):<br/>
you can do enroll by doing an sdk call, and it will use that section to auth with the ca-server for you.

Could be some incompatibility with the protos (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/e7f22b3d24cfa36d718299d65d1971ff88e22fa2/internal/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/discovery/client/client.go#L593 / https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/e7f22b3d24cfa36d718299d65d1971ff88e22fa2/internal/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/gossip/message.pb.go#L604)

Now that we have Go modules, I am looking at using the canonical import path for Go fabric protos (we can still substitute back to the curated version by having a submodule at third_party/github.com/hyperledger/fabric).

This would need downstream projects to edit the import paths for protos, if they are using them.

@dave.enyeart @sykesm - it would be useful to know if the Fabric project will be moving the protos directory (to enable a common Go import path).

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 15:02:12 GMT):<br/>
That is a bit distressing
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 15:08:06 GMT):<br/>
The problem we have is that the current structure is a bit odd. We didn't want projects to need to depend on Fabric code that might change (or wasn't designed to be used as a library -- e.g., extra dependencies / imports that a client wouldn't need)... so we created a curated version in internal / third_party.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 15:08:45 GMT):<br/>
This caused some issues (e.g., some people wanted to use some code from the Fabric project but the proto types were now incompatible).
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 15:09:30 GMT):<br/>
So additional Fabric code was copied, patched and exposed here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/tree/master/third_party/github.com/hyperledger/fabric
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 15:09:46 GMT):<br/>
That part doens't really distress me as much as the fabric proto changing that makes a version independent sdk impossible..
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 15:09:56 GMT):<br/>
Since then, the Fabric protos directory has been cleaned up to only have protos in it :).
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 15:09:56 GMT):<br/>
Since then, the Fabric protos directory has been cleaned up to only have protos in it and Go modules now allow substitution during builds.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 15:10:56 GMT):<br/>
@nyet ah - we would be pinning to a specific proto version in go.mod
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 15:11:47 GMT):<br/>
(I actually think, at the beginning, we could still be using the code from fabric-sdk-go/third_party for projects using go mod)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 15:12:12 GMT):<br/>
@nyet take a look here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/go.mod#L18
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 15:13:36 GMT):<br/>
We are defining the protos as its own module. This means we can substitute import paths to our module version (e.g., github.com/hyperledger/fabric actually refers to our curated "fabric" module that is in the SDK repo itself).
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 15:13:52 GMT):<br/>
but the import paths are now "canonical"
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 15:15:14 GMT):<br/>
So I think, with Go module-based builds, we still have the flexibility that we have now... but, we don't need to fiddle with the import paths.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 15:15:22 GMT):<br/>
@nyet what do you think?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 15:17:03 GMT):<br/>
I think modules are definitley the way to go, but I don't pretend to know enough about either fabric or the way they define (and develop) the protocol to know what the best fit is.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 15:17:15 GMT):<br/>
I am completely ignorant of the workflow :/
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 15:18:03 GMT):<br/>
But in general, go module support should supplant dep anyway, long term. If it helps solve this problem it is a no brainer.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=vtD5ysRci3SdphzCJ) @yxuco the -u flag is what is causing your issue.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 18:26:21 GMT):<br/>
go help module-get

The -u flag instructs get to update dependencies to use newer minor or
patch releases when available. Continuing the previous example,
'go get -u A' will use the latest A with B v1.3.1 (not B v1.2.3).

(I'm guessing some dependency has an issue when updated).

Hey guys, I'm facing an issue when creating my first client using the SDK. I manually created a connection profile YAML to connect to the 'first-network' example of the official fabric samples. Everything seems good but I cannot create the channel client: `client := sdk.ChannelContext("integrity-channel", fabsdk.WithUser("Admin@org1.example.com"), fabsdk.WithOrg("Org1"))`
peer0 of organisation org1 tells me in its log that the TLS handshake failed because the `first record does not look like a TLS handshake`. So it seems like my Go client is not attempting a proper SSL handshake, how would I activate that?

Does the sdk-go client API supports transient arguments?  In the chaincode private collection sample, you can send transient data via a map in stub.  Does the sdk-go client API already support such calls with transient parameters?  If so, where can I find a sample of such client app?  Thanks.

because the file name changes when recreating the crypto material and its obviously kinda ugly
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 16:20:10 GMT):<br/>
@vignesh make sure CryptoConfig path points to `~/go-book/src/github.com/my_fabric/crypto-config` at this line: https://github.com/vigneshkm/my_fabric_1/blob/df82f7dff05bb031a6bb81c540d91551cc35e18f/endpointconfig_override.go#L85 (or try and print `pathvar.Subst("${MY_FABRIC}/crypto-config")` to make sure it matches the above path)
as for CredentialStore just use `/tmp/store/`, do not set it the Admin user's MSP path for this field

FYI: support for go modules has been completed in latest master. You can now also develop and test the SDK outside the gopath.

dep support is also now deprecated.

An outstanding issue is the import path for protos.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 14:30:30 GMT):<br/>
(Having a canonical import path)
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 15:44:05 GMT):<br/>
what's the end goal for that? 
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 15:44:22 GMT):<br/>
cause it's a pain to have the sdk and upstream at the same time.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 15:47:48 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda should `vendor/` still be .gitignored?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 15:48:05 GMT):<br/>
i dont know what make sense for modules, I'm new to them
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 15:48:53 GMT):<br/>
@nyet you no longer need the vendor folder when using modules.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 15:49:27 GMT):<br/>
yea so i'm thinking it should show up in `git status` so you're aware its unused ...
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 15:49:44 GMT):<br/>
but i dont know modules best practicies
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 15:50:32 GMT):<br/>
Maybe ... something to think about :).
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 15:51:53 GMT):<br/>
@MHBauer Historically, the fabric-sdk-go project has contained the protos under its own namespace (github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/...). There are some SDK functions that return the protobuf types (using the SDK’s copy of the protos, and therefore, the SDK’s types). Going forward, it would be nice if we could return compatible/canonical types so that code across projects can pass those types around.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 15:52:18 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda also maybe `internal`:
```
# github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/internal/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/operations
../../hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/internal/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/operations/system.go:227:23: not enough arguments in call to s.statsd.SendLoop
        have (<-chan time.Time, string, string)
        want (context.Context, <-chan time.Time, string, string)
```
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 15:52:35 GMT):<br/>
@MHBauer With modules, you can replace the canonical path with the SDK's copy of the protos.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 15:52:55 GMT):<br/>
So you don't technically need to bring in the upstream project.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 15:53:20 GMT):<br/>
not sure what when wrong there :/
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 15:53:51 GMT):<br/>
(i.e., the SDK would retain the copy of protos in third_party).
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 15:53:51 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 15:57:04 GMT):<br/>
Ah. I'm guessing that dependency needs to have the pinned version (from the module file)
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 15:57:10 GMT):<br/>
yea i think so to
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 15:57:33 GMT):<br/>
In practice, our scripts may not be filtering out enough from the upstream but it's a balance.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 15:57:36 GMT):<br/>
statsd seems to have changed that api :/

</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 15:59:16 GMT):<br/>
No, I need upstream for other resaons.
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 15:59:31 GMT):<br/>
And we have not looked at modules.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:04:41 GMT):<br/>
@MHBauer So in a project that also brings in the upstream, you would end using the protos from the upstream. Did that bring a concern for you?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:04:55 GMT):<br/>
@troryronda `make populate-vendor` fixed it

just a heads up :)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:05:56 GMT):<br/>
You don't need vendor when using modules.

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:06:24 GMT):<br/>
If you are in the gopath prior to 1.13 you need to explicility enable modules via environment variable. GO111MODULE
</p>

ah ok
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:07:14 GMT):<br/>
If you checked your project outside of the gopath, then modules are enabled by default.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:07:32 GMT):<br/>
got it
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:08:08 GMT):<br/>
If you don't use modules (or dep) then you have to manually populate vendor (or gopath) with the correct versions
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:08:28 GMT):<br/>
modules are much nicer as dependencies are downloaded by the go build process itself.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:09:07 GMT):<br/>
(automatically).
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:09:23 GMT):<br/>
now i'm getting lots of these

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:09:25 GMT):<br/>
(and they don't pollute your workspace with vendor folders).
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:09:28 GMT):<br/>
yea
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:10:39 GMT):<br/>
@nyet you need to use master rather than alpha5 to use modules.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:10:51 GMT):<br/>
ah didn't see that
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:11:11 GMT):<br/>
yeh - we tagged right before the module work. once modules are settled down, we should tag again.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:14:06 GMT):<br/>
hrm i am using `master` where is that tag coming from
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:14:09 GMT):<br/>
thats odd
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:14:36 GMT):<br/>
the go get behavior (with modules) is now to get the latest tag rather than master
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:14:48 GMT):<br/>
you need to explicitly put "@master"
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:15:16 GMT):<br/>
ah ok

</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 20:10:26 GMT):<br/>
upstream needs to take stuff out into some common place. especially the protos.

<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 16:00:07 GMT):<br/>
@vieiramanoel I've added one additional tiny comment for clarity
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 16:06:49 GMT):<br/>
So fabric-ca-client doesn't like the sdk `getCertBytesFromStore`
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 16:07:35 GMT):<br/>
`fabric-ca-client enroll` puts the sign cert in `cert.pem` but `getCertBytesFromStore` expects it in `<user>@<MSPID>-cert.pem`
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 16:08:47 GMT):<br/>
that's because `etCertBytesFromStore` (as the name states) gets the cert from the store which is following the msp directory structure inside the store
</p>

<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 16:57:35 GMT):<br/>
@nyet if you noticed the generated crypto-gen artefacts in the Go SDK integration tests, a user cert is stored under: `fabric-sdk-go/test/fixtures/fabric/v1/crypto-config/ordererOrganizations/example.com/users/Admin@example.com/msp/signcerts/Admin@example.com-cert.pem` (`crypto-config` folder is generated)

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 17:01:15 GMT):<br/>
no i mean using `fabric-ca-client`
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 17:01:31 GMT):<br/>
the value precediging `_sk` is the SKI for that private key

@troyronda directly related to a question I asked the other day "how do I calculate the block hash to query by block hash" there isn't anything in sdk-go, it's in upstream fabric. so the sdk has provided a function that's impossible to use unless you already know the right answer.
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 19:12:46 GMT):<br/>
overall, I'm not sure who it should be, but one of the goals should be to provide some interface that dosen't require me to think about protos.
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 19:12:49 GMT):<br/>
they're not for people.
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 19:29:20 GMT):<br/>
@MHBauer which go SDK function are you talking about exactly?
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 20:08:07 GMT):<br/>
@nyet try this library: https://github.com/gbolo/go-util/tree/master/getSKI .. @gbolo is the developer of the tool ;)

</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 21:03:00 GMT):<br/>
there are three test calls for this function in our integration tests @MHBauer (not sure why you're not linking to master) here's an example (from master): https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/e2e/orgs/multiple_orgs_test.go#L430

<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 21:13:15 GMT):<br/>
I guess you can pass in the blockNumber 
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 21:13:19 GMT):<br/>
I have a blockhash.
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 21:13:27 GMT):<br/>
or what I thought was the blockhash.
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 21:13:32 GMT):<br/>
before I learned it wasn't.
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 21:14:10 GMT):<br/>
there's a function in upstream fabric that calculates it, which we've copied over, because we'd start having dependency collisions if we imported it to use.
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 21:15:04 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/v1.4.1/protos/common/block.go#L44-L75 

something like this should be in the sdk
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 21:15:28 GMT):<br/>
or the hash should just be stored in the block metadata or something
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 21:16:15 GMT):<br/>
if you have the block.... why would you want to retrieve it from the API call? 
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 21:16:18 GMT):<br/>
it is... ledgerInfoBefore, err := ledgerClient.QueryInfo(ledger.WithTargets(orgTestPeer0, orgTestPeer1), ledger.WithMinTargets(2), ledger.WithMaxTargets(3)) .. `ledgerInfoBefore` has a BCI...
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 21:16:18 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 21:16:47 GMT):<br/>
just like the test, you get the block hash this way : `ledgerInfoBefore.BCI.CurrentBlockHash`
</p>

that's only whatever the currentblockhash is.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:05:05 GMT):<br/>
i wonder why we gave these weird filenames in the first place
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:05:40 GMT):<br/>
we could've given "key.pem" or something
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:06:07 GMT):<br/>
my guess is to support several key-cert pairs

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:06:12 GMT):<br/>
yea
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:06:15 GMT):<br/>
but there are other ways of doing that :/ 
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:06:27 GMT):<br/>
well its so you can find which key goes with which pub key in a determisttic way
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:06:38 GMT):<br/>
i know why they do it, I just couldn't figure out what the `openssl` equivalent was
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:06:58 GMT):<br/>
i.e if it's a elliptic curve you can just know that the public key is the curve generator multiplied by the secret key no?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:07:10 GMT):<br/>
well the problem is to find the FILENAME of the _sk
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:07:22 GMT):<br/>
like - said
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:07:23 GMT):<br/>
so you can figoure out which item in the keystore/ belongs to the pub
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:07:26 GMT):<br/>
without scanning all of them
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:07:32 GMT):<br/>
you take the secret key, and scan all public keys
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:07:42 GMT):<br/>
this way you dont have to scan all of them
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:07:48 GMT):<br/>
well to find priv from pub
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:07:59 GMT):<br/>
to find pub from priv ya you have to scan the pubs
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:08:05 GMT):<br/>
yes, but is it worth so much users complaining?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:08:06 GMT):<br/>

(afaik)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:08:58 GMT):<br/>
it's not only that.... it's also when you generate certs in tests, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:09:07 GMT):<br/>
it's "hard" to find the key file
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:09:12 GMT):<br/>
even though... there is only 1
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:09:17 GMT):<br/>
since only 1 pair was generated
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:09:57 GMT):<br/>
unless you have old stuff floating around, which sometimes i do :/

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=otSMjLPQqdM8XuNb9) @nyet Apparently openssl uses SHA1 digest by default and Fabric keys use SHA256 digest... If you can add SHA256 to the dgst command I think it will work
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Sat, 13 Apr 2019 17:56:45 GMT):<br/>
If it doesn't work, then simply use @gbolo's getSKI tool
</p>

well it does work asn1parse just spits that error no clue why
</p>
<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 15 Apr 2019 03:17:59 GMT):<br/>
because asn1parse expects SHA1.. while the public key is SHA256
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 15 Apr 2019 03:19:38 GMT):<br/>
not sure it matters, at the asn1 level the data at 23 is just a bit string

<p><strong>Baha-sk</strong> (Mon, 15 Apr 2019 04:08:30 GMT):<br/>
I tried with -sha256  for `openssl dgst` and it worked with no error... to be honest, the output after the error in your original output matches the SKI in the `_sk` file, so you should be fine @nyet

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 15 Apr 2019 04:08:56 GMT):<br/>
the error is in the asn1parse command, not the dgst command

Hello Everyone, As Fabric SDK for Go and Python has not been released officially but available for testing and development so should we use these SDKs for production applications? Like Composer is not recommended for production use.

@troyronda  why go sdk only have alpha releases while other sdk's have stable releases as per the fabric release? Does this mean go sdk is not production ready?

Hi to all ! Does anyone encounter issue about the discovery service ? My fabric is currently deployed on different machine without docker and seems to run well. However, my application cannot send transaction proposal to the peers. The weird thing is when I launch the app the sdk client is created without errors (the peers logs request coming from the IP of the app host) but I can't register chaincode event and the error returned is "no peers to connect to". The issue came from the  dispatcher.go located at fabric-sdk-go/pkg/fab/events/client/dispatcher/dispatcher.go. It seems I get an empty array from the GetPeers() function. I don't understand why the connection is possible for the creation of the SDK client but is impossible when registering chaincode event. The version of the binairies I use is v1.2.0. All the ip addresses and hostname are reference in the hosts file, the ports are open (I used netcat and netstat to verify it). Any ideas ?

Hi, a question regarding graph behavior in the Docker containers. 
When running the containers I get the message below every 3 seconds or so. Is this what it should be, or is this the result of a configuration error?
```

Hey guys!
Is it possible to initialize go-fabric-sdk without specifying organization crypto material and user ? Everything I have is CA link and CA admin credentials and I want to obtain all crypto using CA.  Seems it's not possible.

@weijinxy @Stacker (or use 0.8.0 of go-kit). E.g., https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/go.mod#L13

@shivraj service discovery doesn't support key level EPs but you can just query the organizations in the chaincode itself

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 07:44:13 GMT):<br/>
and then in the application, sort the peers by their organization

I having troubles with my chaincode. The GetState function returns data but PutState is not saving data in the blockchain. For example: I do a GetState (returns correct data) and a try to update the values with PutState, but once i do a second GetState the returned value is still the old one. Can anyone help me ?

Can anyone point me to an example/tutorial that shows new client/context setup and channel creation via the golang SDK that works for HLF v1.4?  The stuff I'm finding online is all terribly old, and it appears the SDK has changed significantly since those walkthroughs were written.  I'm trying to follow the basic workflow provided here: https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go, but am fumbling with the context creation details. :-(

Is anyone developing a fabric project on  Windows Subsystem for Linux(WSL) and having issues with docker-compose?

Hi all, I am looking to write unit tests for my chaincode that I have created. I am using a MockStub to then call my chaincode. I am able to call my various implemented functions just fine. My functions contain the following:
```
actorID, err := cid.GetID(stub)
	if err != nil {
		return shim.Error(fmt.Sprintf("unable to identify the ID of the request owner: %v", err))
	}
``` 
to be able to help restrict users that invoke chaincode. My problem is that I want to be able to write a method which can imitate this. Can anyone help please?
</p>
<p><strong>HaydenGriffin</strong> (Thu, 25 Apr 2019 15:15:59 GMT):<br/>

@Psingh run a grep on your configs.  You have mismatched channel names. "testchainid" vs "testchannelid" somewhere.

Can anyone give me some pointers on how to test a transaction using MockShim that makes use of calls to cid.GetID()? I'm on HLF v1.4 and have pulled in MockShim changes from the master described here (https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5644), but clearly don't have things setup correctly. Testing the ID checks is pretty critical, but I'd really like to avoid having to actually install/instantiate on a real instance during development in order to test.

Is there any plan to add feature for dynamic selection of peer to satisfy the endorsement policy on key-level endorsement policies in fabric go-sdk?  @yacovm  @weijinxy @troyronda 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 09:44:33 GMT):<br/>
@shivraj no, i tried to push for it but i got resistance. You can implement it in the application layer by having the chaincode query the organizations for a key and returning this to the client and then the client can use service discovery to see the mappinh between peers and orgs

I assume it's more about having a contributor for it...

Is there a section of documentation describing how to use the Fabric SDK to manage chaincode?
The following quote from the docs indicates chaincode management by the SDK is possible:
```
The Hyperledger Fabric language-specific SDKs abstract the specifics of the Hyperledger Fabric API to facilitate application development, though it can be used to manage a chaincode’s lifecycle.
```
So, I'd like to write a Go program rather than a Bash script to do my chaincode installation.

Awesome! Thank you so much, I'll try it out.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=yqFL5YYzDsRXDSw4w) Which HLF version did you use?
</p>
<p><strong>Psingh</strong> (Fri, 10 May 2019 07:31:01 GMT):<br/>
I tried chainHero with HLF v1.4 and there are so many issues.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 10 May 2019 15:48:51 GMT):<br/>
1.4 and 1.4.1

Can anyone point me to (or show me) how to move between a ca-client-config.yaml file and a msp.ClientContext? The example code uses a call to a mockClientProvider() for the context. I've found example code in the ChainHero writeup, but that uses what I'm guessing is an older version of the fabric-golang-sdk (because the import paths are not correct), and the calls they make are not correct (at least for the latest fabric-sdk-go.)
I'm guessing that there is a filereader somewhere, and then a utility class to turn that reader in a a ClientConfig which I then can use to create a ClientContext, but but currently I'm not spotting it.
Note: This is to call some of the functions that interact with the MSP.
</p>
<p><strong>spmcnamara</strong> (Fri, 10 May 2019 20:12:21 GMT):<br/>
@Psingh I agree with you 100%.  ChainHero example needs to be updated to be helpful.
</p>
<p><strong>spmcnamara</strong> (Fri, 10 May 2019 20:16:29 GMT):<br/>
Regarding my question: I see how to load the YAML with config.FromFile, which gives me a ConfigProvider, but I'm actually trying to get a ClientProvider.

Hi, I am looking for help on how to configure the latest tagged code - v1.0.0-alpha5 to target and run v1.0.0-alpha3 [basically run current SDK in backward compatible Fabric V1.1.0 release mode]. I am not able to correctly achieve this outcome - even after adjusting the .env and makefiles. Is there a document that I can use to achieve this outcome? Can you please point me to something anything? I am getting errors ranging from one of the org peers exiting abnormally, some docker images (baseos) not being found in docker hub and some of PKI folders not being found in the locations that crypto-config should be staged... Thank you in advance

Hey everyone.
Did anyone face similar issue?

@Psingh Have you confirmed that peer1 is up and running properly?  If you connect to that container, can you see the process listening on port 8053?
</p>
<p><strong>spmcnamara</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 18:17:08 GMT):<br/>
Also, do you really want to change the port configuration for that particular container, or do you want to change the port-mapping that docker uses to expose that container?  You are doing the former, but I think you might really want to do the latter (but not sure.)

@Psingh Can you run "netstat -a|grep 7053"
</p>
<p><strong>spmcnamara</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 17:45:42 GMT):<br/>
Better yet, just grep LISTEN and look at all those ports.
</p>
<p><strong>spmcnamara</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 17:48:41 GMT):<br/>
Based on your config, the event service for peer1 should be listening on port 8053 on your machine.  That means your other instances/services should be attempting to talk to port 8053 when sending events.
</p>
<p><strong>Psingh</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 04:52:32 GMT):<br/>
@spmcnamara All the ports are listening but using ipv6 address.

Can anyone tell me what the trick is in SDK client code to bump up the logging level (or find the logging output) from the SDK logger - guessing it's going to stderr, but is set too high to have any output.  I've tried logger.SetLevel("", logging.DEBUG) at the start of my client code, but it doesn't appear to have any effect.

Is there any chance to implement own KeyStore for fabric sdk? 
There is possibility to get own crypto suite with keystore, but it's not possible to implement the interface because it is internal pkg. Does anyone have a clue?

Hi,

For your info + solution for those running into the same (weird) problem.

I get/got this error when building my application

```
../github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/internal/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/operations/system.go:227:23: not enough arguments in call to s.statsd.SendLoop
	have (<-chan time.Time, string, string)
	want (context.Context, <-chan time.Time, string, string)
```
in the method `func (s *System) startMetricsTickers() error {…}`

Solution: I had to change in the file `system.go` line 227 
from
`go s.statsd.SendLoop(s.sendTicker.C, network, address)`
to
`go s.statsd.SendLoop(nil, s.sendTicker.C, network, address)`, i.e. insert nil as first param.

to get it to work again. 

Seems I’m working with a different version of `kitstatsd "github.com/go-kit/kit/metrics/statsd”` because I had to install `github.com/go-kit/…` manually after having a battle with Go Modules (long story).
</p>
<p><strong>Psingh</strong> (Tue, 21 May 2019 15:30:23 GMT):<br/>
There is an alternative to this @habpygo . I think its not a nice idea to edit fabric source code.
you can try solution 1 : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55811937/getting-error-not-enough-arguments-in-call-to-s-statsd-sendloop-when-running
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Tue, 21 May 2019 15:39:03 GMT):<br/>
I managed to get both dep and modules working fine so avoided having to edit anything.
</p>
<p><strong>rootDistress</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 05:48:34 GMT):<br/>
The go-kit changed the function parameters, You could git reset go-kit repo to an earlier version that was comparable with fabric.
</p>
<p><strong>habpygo</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 07:43:10 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @Psingh - @rootDistress, that did the trick. I downgraded to v0.8.0 and changed the params back to 3.

hello All, i am building a smartcontract and i am creating a query to find my data.. until now everything is ok, but now i want to sort this field and i am receiving an error that i don't have an index to do so ... anyone knows how i create this index using GoLang ? this is my current query: {	"selector":{"price":{ "$lte": 0.35}}, 
"sort": ["price"]
}
this is the response:
{
"error": {
"message": "GET_QUERY_RESULT failed: transaction ID: 6d921f7b84664df2739eea607e58855d5a1c81f5d93fbc0005eb30b0c9ce3852: error handling CouchDB request. Error:no_usable_index, Status Code:400, Reason:No index exists for this sort, try indexing by the sort fields.",

Hi, I'm developing app using fabric-sdk-go, seems it works normal with one peer (any of 3 deployed pees in my network) in config file (with almost default options), but when I add several peers into config file from time to time I've got error on response "Discovery status Code: (11) UNKNOWN. Description: error getting endorsers: no endorsement combination can be satisfied". What does it mean?

Write a REST interpreter that converts them to chaincode calls.

There is some very non-obvious behavior when reading in the certificates necessary to start up an app that uses the Fabric Go SDK client. I am curious as to whether the behavior is intentional or not. I'd love to submit a pull request if we think there is room for improvement here.
The user "...cert.pem" file has to be very specifically named, including the '@' symbol in the name like "User1@example.org-cert.pem", otherwise the SDK client fails to start. 
What is the rationale for this behavior?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 20:20:50 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure if MSPs are supposed to be allowed to have more than one cert in `signcerts/`... if not, it would make sense to just glob for a file. A lot of the MSP filename handling is kinda crazy; see also what happens when you enroll as a tls user :/

Hi all, we are seeing an issue with the SDK where we get errors for a specific node endpoint when connecting to the orderer node, but the config we pass in does not even have the hostname in the error message.  For example (fake endpoints):
```
CreateAndSendTransaction failed: SendTransaction failed: calling orderer 'nd-foo.m-bar.n-baz.com:30001' failed: Orderer Client Status Code: (2) CONNECTION_FAILED. Description: dialing connection timed out [nd-foo.m-bar.n-baz.com:30001]
```
But the orderer endpooint that we specify points to a load balancer:
orderer.n-baz.com

From the perspective of the client, there is no way we can even get the `nd-foo` or `m-bar` values, so it seems like the SDK is resolving the nodes behind the loadbalancer.  Does anyone know how this might be happening or if there is a way to prevent the resolution?

From the perspective of the client, there is no way we can even get the `nd-foo` or `m-bar` values, so it seems like the SDK is resolving the nodes behind the loadbalancer.  Does anyone know how this might be happening or if there is a way to prevent the resolution?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 23:44:07 GMT):<br/>
That seems unlikely. I dont think the endpoints are encoded anywhere in the communications itself. What sort of loadbalancer is there? It isn't as if you can run mroe than one orderer behind a conventional load balancer.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 23:44:38 GMT):<br/>
the only place endpoints are encoded is in the anchor peer section of a channel config block
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 23:44:53 GMT):<br/>
and those are peers, not orderers
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 23:45:38 GMT):<br/>
oops. no, that isn't true. the order hostname is in the system channel config block
</p>
<p><strong>KaseyAlusi</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 00:02:25 GMT):<br/>
Unfortunately I don't know much about the orderer loadbalancer.  For what its worth, this is using the AWS Managed Blockchain with Fabric.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 00:02:47 GMT):<br/>
thats definitely going to be an AWS question then.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 00:03:12 GMT):<br/>
you'll have to bring it up with them. The orderer shouldn't be behind a loadbalacer in the first place.

hi everyone, hope you can help me! thank you in advance. I have instrumented example_cc in fabric-cli's chaincode sample with Prometheus metrics using Prometheus Go Client side library and verified it to be working correctly - natively. When I try to run this chaincode in a container form however - I am getting instantiate step fail due to Prometheus client side library packages being not found. I tried doing vendoring but still the library calls are not being resolved [Fabric CLI is a sample command-line interface built using Fabric SDK GO]. I am hoping someone can point me to correct path. I am getting the following errors, coming from deploy step of one of peer containers:

I must be missing something here. The project compiles fine and runs fine natively. I can scrape the metrics and wire the details on to Grafana dashboard panes/widgets. When I run the tested chaincode inside container - spun by peers - things go incorrectly. I am using the Go Module package resolution with semver management scheme. It is working correctly as I expect - based on my limited but just-in-time learnt concepts [Ryan Cox's/Tylor Bui et al https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules and related wiki - https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#how-do-i-use-vendoring-with-modules-is-vendoring-going-away] content. Please share your wisdom and I am happy to share my project.

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Sat, 15 Jun 2019 01:44:20 GMT):<br/>
I am having similar issues with modules inside of chaincode, fwiw
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Sat, 15 Jun 2019 01:44:45 GMT):<br/>
and i also tried modules with vendoring
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Sat, 15 Jun 2019 01:46:07 GMT):<br/>
I suspect part of the probllem might be "Note that only the main module's top-level vendor directory is used; vendor directories in other locations are still ignored."
</p>
<p><strong>pvrbharg</strong> (Sat, 15 Jun 2019 12:25:40 GMT):<br/>
@nyet Yes, I agree with your read and I am reading the same at this URL - https://tip.golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Modules_and_vendoring. Perhaps keeping the vendor directory at the top level and using go build -mod=vendor may be the key - however this could potentially require code change inside fabricsdkgo to passin the above build option - given peer spins up a build container to build the image that contains fabric shim + chaincode and stands up this image as a chaincode container that can work with its parent peer. As of now - I need to investigate what build command is being used by the docker daemon to build the image of chaincode container - programmatically - when the deploy operation takes place as part of lscc flow [at the time of instantiate invocation]. We need to use the build command to be as indicated above go build -mod=vendor with vendor dependent packages being staged at the root. Details here under modules and vendoring heading - https://tip.golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Modules_and_vendoring. 
Thanks.

<p><strong>pvrbharg</strong> (Sat, 15 Jun 2019 17:25:02 GMT):<br/>
@nyet @troyronda Expanding on my previous comment - "fabric/core/chaincode/platforms/util/utils.go -> DockerBuild function uses the go build command and this may need to be configurable [such as go build -mod=vendor]" - from fabric-sdk-go when we try to use vendoring? Perhaps you can share your thoughts and wisdom. I can also check with our fabric repo developers to see if this cmd is configurable or if so how... Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Sat, 15 Jun 2019 18:28:54 GMT):<br/>
Unfortunately that may not help if dependencies of dependencies are not vendored. I suspect module support in a sandbox may be more difficult than it looks. The module system was not really meant for this. Incidentally this problem affects some CI workflows as well. I think the whole module architecture may have many unintended consequences.

@nyet Dear nyet - you are proven correct and I tried with go build -mod=vendor - where all vendoring is needed per my understanding and re-tried - still getting the same result as you suspected. In my current attempt - I recursively looked for where ever I have go.sum and go.mod files in the project tree, installed the prometheus, promauto, and promhttp libraries v1.0.0 by running go get commands, verified that go.mod and go.sum files are correctly updated, used these libraries in example_cc with instrumentation and attempted to re-ram. Prior to these changes - I made sure - my baseline program worked and I also ran successfully example_cc_test.go - to make sure I am good. So your suspicion is proved good and I am underestimating potentially the effort involved here. THANK YOU in any case - for your sharing your skills and wisdom!

@nyet @pvrbharg Could you please summarize the issue? It sounds like you have a fabric-sdk-go based project using modules that has a chaincode in a subdirectory?
</p>
<p><strong>pvrbharg</strong> (Mon, 17 Jun 2019 13:22:18 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda I have a customer project that requires to deploy a chaincode that uses Prometheus instrumentation embedded in the chaincode using Prometheus Go language client side chaincode libraries. To prepare for this deployment - I tried using fabric-cli example project with Prometheus metrics instrumented. This is one of reference samples from fabric-sdk-go repo at https://github.com/securekey/fabric-examples/tree/master/fabric-cli/. I can get the example_cc.go to correctly work natively when I compile and run. However I can not get the dependencies resolved when I try to containerize this instrumented and modified example_cc.go program. This may be due to semver dependencies scheme introduced by Go release of v1.11 or later - perhaps. Here is where I need help. Hope this helps or please ask for more clarity and I would explain or webex or share my project. Thanks.

Hi Can we integrate oracle db instead of couch db in hyperledger fabric?
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Wed, 19 Jun 2019 18:55:55 GMT):<br/>
Hey guys, I have a design question maybe you can help me with it. 
There are `Instituition` objects stored on the ledger, which represent peers/noderunners on the network. There are also `Agent`s and `Client`s with an `Agent` working for a specific `Instituition` and `Client` being the end user
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Wed, 19 Jun 2019 18:56:01 GMT):<br/>
All these objects are on chain 
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Wed, 19 Jun 2019 18:56:18 GMT):<br/>
The Agents and Clients have two separate websites to do things on which both talk to the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Wed, 19 Jun 2019 18:56:54 GMT):<br/>
Now, what is the best way I can manage identity? So far, I've been issuing certs to the Insituitions and have a database mapping (NOT blockchain) from Agent ID's (on chain IDs) to email/password combos
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Wed, 19 Jun 2019 18:57:09 GMT):<br/>
a login system exists on the Agent website side which logs them in using their own internal DB and maps their profile to an ID on chain
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Wed, 19 Jun 2019 18:57:24 GMT):<br/>
I havent yet figured out how to solve identity for Client
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Wed, 19 Jun 2019 18:57:47 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Wed, 19 Jun 2019 19:01:00 GMT):<br/>
What do you think about instead of using the DB to map Agent email/passwords to onchain IDs, I just store their email/passwords on chain as well 
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Wed, 19 Jun 2019 19:01:09 GMT):<br/>
I hash their email, and bcrypt their password
</p>
<p><strong>haardikkk</strong> (Wed, 19 Jun 2019 19:01:26 GMT):<br/>
so during a Login request, I can search for the hashed email and then use bcrypt to verify the password

Hey, I'm trying to enroll users and write the private key and enrollment cert to a file for later use. The PrivateKey() method on the*msp.User struct returned from GetSigningIdentity returns an implementation of core.Key that does not allow the Bytes() method. I.e I am not able to retrieve the bytes of the private key. How would one get around this? Is there another best practice for enrolling new users and saving their cert + key?

Hello! I'm new here, and recent newcomer to the Hyperledger universe. Is this the right place to ask questions as a developer?
</p>
<p><strong>PabloLalloni</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 13:34:35 GMT):<br/>
Ok, here I comes my first big question: when chaincode responds with an error we want to use Response.Payload to inform the client details about the problem (business stuff) so we're doing things like `return &peer.Response{Status:404, Payload:foo, Message:msg}` (foo being a rich problem report), ¿is this something allowed by design?
</p>
<p><strong>PabloLalloni</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 13:36:30 GMT):<br/>
We ceased to use the "factory method"  `return shim.Error(msg)` because it only allows to set Response.Message as a string, and it was really awful to put something (say a JSON document) as a "message".

Hi Guys.  Stepping back to some code that I had working previously, but am getting the following error when I try to call Execute() on my channel client: 
`Chaincode status Code: (500) UNKNOWN. Description: Unknown function invoke`
Using the peer command I can see that the chaincode is installed and instantiated.  I'm really perplexed.  Any suggestions/pointers?
</p>
<p><strong>hendry19901990</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 14:05:28 GMT):<br/>
I think `Execute()` function has some issues

Does anyone know of a best-practices guide for go SDK lifecycle management?  For example, is it better to create a new SDK per request and close it after?  Is it better to maintain a pool of SDKs for each instance of the app and re-use them?

Hi Everybody.  I just joined.   I have a blockchain working properly but using the "hand generated" crypto fixture.  The peers, endorser and couchdb run as docker in the cloud.  My wallets are go-apps running on my computers using fabric-sdk-go.  In the correspondinf config.yaml, I pointed the cryptoconfig.path of client to the loacl copy of the fixtures and organization.```
I have now implemented the same peers, couchdb but using fabric-ca.  I was able to instantiate my chaincode queries by scripting via a docker cli.  (I heavily adapted the fabric-ca example of fabric-samples v1.3) I want to use now fabric-sdk-go.  What parameters should I provide to client.cryptoconfig.path  and organizations.org1.cryptopath  to benefit from fabric-ca?  Is there a tutorial somewhere?

Thanks Nyet.   It uses more recent templates than the chainhero's posts.  Thus useful.  It was easy to instantiate my own chaincode on it.  Great. Did you test it with the Enroll functions of fabric-sdk-go? I am experiencing some issues with TLS with the CA server.  For instance, I had to add a url line in config.yaml.  Still having some issue with certificate.

Hi,
I have a hyperledger fabric testnet with 2 orgs and 2 peers per org. The peer0 of each organization is the anchor peer. I want to instantiate a chaincode with an endorsment policy with one organization Org1, so I specify the policy: "AND('org1MSP.member"). I have installed the chaincode in the peers of the org1 only, because org2 is not endorser.
However, the chaincode doesn't instantiate because it sending the proposal to the peers that are in the other organization (org2). The logs are the following:
{
    "error": "Error creating Chaincode: sending deploy transaction proposal failed: Multiple errors occurred: - Transaction processing for endorser [peer0.org2.example.com:8051]: Endorser Client Status Code: (23) CHAINCODE_NAME_NOT_FOUND.

Description: cannot get package for chaincode (examplecc:2)"
}
 The problem is because these peers doesn't have the chaincode installed, but...why the SDK is sending the endorsement request to the peers that not belongs to the endorsement policy?

@mtng based on the policy supplied above - the syntax looks wrong,  should be `"AND('Org1.member')"` - if not specified [correctly?] at instantiation time, the endorsement policy defaults to “any member of the organizations in the channel”, so this is possibly why you see what you see? Easy to re-check anyway.

Hi, thanks for you response! Sorry, I wrote it bad copy-pasting :sweat_smile: in the code I'm using the function cauthdsl.FromString and the policy "AND('org1MSP.member')", if the endorsment policy is wrong it throws and error. For example, if i write org1MSP.membsrs the error is: Unable to access unexported field 'membsrs' in token 'org1MSP.membsrs'"

I'd like to understand the user model and key provisioning workflow for Fabric users provisioned from Fabric CA. What good examples exist showing this key provisioning workflow using the Go SDK?
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 01:21:18 GMT):<br/>
@medikent From the Fabric CA point of view, a Fabric CA client (an application which manages Fabric user registration/enrollment/etc) first registers a new user by calling the Fabric CA registration API. The resulting user name and enrollment secret are passed out of band to the new user. The user then needs to enroll with the CA by creating a key pair, then creating a CSR, and finally enrolling with the CA by calling the CA enrollment API. The result of the enrollment is a certificate signed by the CA which the new user provides as its identity when talking to Fabric nodes (peers and orderers). The Go SDK can help by providing partial or full support for this process. The MSP client of the SDK can do both the new user registration, as well as the enrollment. During enrollment, the SDK accepts the username and the enrollment secret (from registration), and first creates a key pair. The private key is stored in the Key Store, and the public key is used to create a CSR. The SDK than calls the Fabric CA to enroll the user. The resulting certificate is returned to the caller. It is also stored in the User Store, for future lookup by the username. The default User Store is a simple file store. SDK client can provide its own implementation of the User Store interface at the time of the SDK instantiation. For crypto operations, the SDK by default delegates to fabric BCCSP library. The SDK can be configured with either "SW" (software) or "pkcs11" implementation of the BCCSP crypto interfaces. The "SW" uses a simple file store implementation of the Key Store interface  for storing private keys, while "pkcs11" uses HSM. When making calls to fabric nodes, an SDK client need to provide its identity. It can be done either by providing only a username (in which case the SDK looks up the certificate and the private key from its stores), or by providing the certificate and the private key. The latter allows the SDK client to have its own key management independent from the SDK. You can take a look at https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pkg/client/msp , also https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/pkg/client/msp/enrollment_test.go, https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/pkg/client/msp/identity_test.go, https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/pkg/client/msp/user_data_mgmt_test.go. Hope this helps.

The SDK should only send proposals to the peers it is told to.
</p>
<p><strong>medikent</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 19:21:05 GMT):<br/>
Yes, this helps tremendously. I am diagramming this process to make it more clear to myself and my team. Are there existing diagrams I could use for inspiration?
</p>
<p><strong>medikent</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 19:31:31 GMT):<br/>
The out of band passing of enrollment secret is something I need to think  through. Does Fabric CA server pass the enrollment secret back to the client? If so then I am thinking I could encrypt the secret and send it back to a mobile device or some custodial key server.
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 19:54:33 GMT):<br/>
Yes, it does, see the test cases.
</p>
<p><strong>aleksandar.likic</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 20:08:12 GMT):<br/>
Sorry no diagrams, most of it would be (except the SDK specifics) Fabric  CA documentation.

hi @nyet ... so, that's my question, why is it doing this? In my config I only have one peer. This happens when the peer is updated to be anchor. In other words, If I don't execute the command (peer channel update -o orderer0.example.com:7050 -c $CHANNEL_NAME --tls $CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED --cafile $ORDERER_CA -f ./channel-artifacts/org2MSPanchors.tx >&log.txt) when I init the network, the error is not happening. But If I execute the command, then when I send the proposal only to the peer which is connected the SDK, I have the error. I just want to understand it, i know the theory.

can someone confirm if gosdk can be used to install node.js chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 20:09:42 GMT):<br/>
I actually can't answer that. All peers joined to a channel will try to endorse every transaction sent to that channel actually. If one of the peers is missing chaincode for the transaction, it will not be able to endorse it. What I don't know is if that prevents the transaction from getting committed even if w/o that endorsement it gets enough other endorsements to satisfy the policy.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 20:10:05 GMT):<br/>
You will likely need to ask somebody who knows more. I am not an expert by any means.

the role of Anchor peer is too provide  cross Organisation communication and I think this is the main reason of this error. 

LEADER Peer is the one who distributes the txn from orderer to other peers of same organisation. 
</p>
<p><strong>Psingh</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 16:39:59 GMT):<br/>
@nyet, actually we define in the config.yaml file which peer is endorser and which is commiter.

```channels:
  mychannel:
    peers:
      peer0.seller.mytrade.com:
        endorsingPeer: true
        chaincodeQuery: true
        ledgerQuery: true
        eventSource: true
```
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 16:40:48 GMT):<br/>
ok thats on the sdk side
</p>
<p><strong>Psingh</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 16:40:54 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 16:41:27 GMT):<br/>
Got it. So the client needs to know what peer can do what, and if it doesn't line up with reality, you might get the error he's seeing?

Hello, I have a question regarding TLS usage in fabric protocols. Not sure that it's a right channel to ask it, but haven't find more suitable one. 
So I'm running organization(ca, peers, orderers) under some proxy which does TLS termination and then traffic goes unsecured inside private network. All configs for nodes have disabled TLS.  
In system channel config I define an external address to my orderer (since foreign peers should be able to connect as well) - orderer.domain.com:443. 
Peers are not able to connect to this endpoint through gossip protocol because certificates are required, but there is no possibility to use system cert pool.  In go sdk there is special config for that, but I found nothing for gossip configuration.
I can create PR for this feature. 
Could you help me with this question? @aleksandar.likic

<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 07:20:39 GMT):<br/>
what do you mean with decentralized governance? 
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 07:20:55 GMT):<br/>
all that stuff with collection signs ?

Hey everyone I'm trying to instantiate the chaincode using go-sdk . below is the command that i'm sending 
```
resp, err := setup.admin.InstantiateCC(setup.ChannelID, resmgmt.InstantiateCCRequest{
		Name:    setup.ChainCodeID,
		Path:    setup.ChaincodeGoPath,
		Version: "1.0",
		Args:    [][]byte{[]byte("init"), []byte("Seller"), []byte("100"), []byte("Buyer"), []byte("200")},
		//Args:   [][]byte{[]byte("init")},
		Policy: ccPolicy,
	})
``` 

but when I checked the peer, chaincode was instantiated but with `Input = nil` value.

```root@c6f8cf4dd928:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer chaincode list --instantiated -C mychannel

<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Mon, 29 Jul 2019 14:55:10 GMT):<br/>
it's very simple fix

<p><strong>Randyshu2018</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 09:37:31 GMT):<br/>
I try it but got an error :

If i selected a wrong type of proto?

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 14:08:30 GMT):<br/>
Which public (exported) method are you referring to?

The SDK uses Service Discovery client internally. The exported methods for the Service Discovery client is actually in the main Fabric project: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/release-1.4/discovery/client
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 14:08:30 GMT):<br/>
Which public (exported) method are you referring to?

The SDK uses Service Discovery client internally (and creates a wrapper on top of the Discovery client imported from the main Fabric project). You can find Fabric's Service Discovery client here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/release-1.4/discovery/client
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 14:12:04 GMT):<br/>
I'm guessing you are trying to use this method directly: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/f1fd02ac671acaf7135ced77d080b9450a519ba6/pkg/fab/discovery/discovery.go#L61 ? (cc: @bstasyszyn )
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 14:16:49 GMT):<br/>
There could potentially be a wrapper Request struct in that package to avoid the internal reference ... Never noticed since we let the SDK automatically handle Service Discovery.
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 14:39:24 GMT):<br/>
yes, exactly. 
I'm trying to use Service Discovery to obtain some info about channel, peers.  For example I need channel details, so I need to know which peer to query. So you suggest use the SD client from fabric directly? 
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 14:39:24 GMT):<br/>
yes, exactly.

</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 14:43:06 GMT):<br/>
Does it make sense to contribute this Wrapper? I would do this 
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 14:50:18 GMT):<br/>
Adding an exposed Request struct to pkg/fab/discovery makes sense to me.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 14:51:36 GMT):<br/>
The SDK wrappers allow you to re-use SDK context / connection structures, so it is helpful to use the SDK wrappers when are already doing other functions with the SDK.

<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 15:00:07 GMT):<br/>
good, I'll try to do PR soon

Hello everyone, I'm facing some issue with 2 organizations setup. There are few questions related to config.yaml. 
my setup consists of 2 orgs and 2 peers/org and ca for each orgs.
let's say I'm using Org1 under client section
```
client:
  organization: Org1
  logging:
    level: debug
  peer:
    timeout:
      connection: 10s
      response: 180s
      discovery:
        greylistExpiry: 10s
  eventService:
    type: deliver
    timeout:
      registrationResponse: 15s
  orderer:
    timeout:
      connection: 15s
      response: 15s
  global:
    timeout:
      query: 180s
      execute: 180s
      resmgmt: 180s
    cache:
      connectionIdle: 30s
      eventServiceIdle: 2m
      channelConfig: 30m
      channelMembership: 30s
      discovery: 10s
      selection: 10m

  # Root of the MSP directories with keys and certs.
  cryptoconfig:
    path: ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/hyperledger/test/network/crypto-config
``` 

So below are the questions
1. Under channels section, should I declare all the peers of both the organisation like below
```
channels:
  mychannel:
    peers:
      peer0.org1.example.com:
        endorsingPeer: true
        chaincodeQuery: true
        ledgerQuery: true
        eventSource: true

      peer1.org1.example.com:
        endorsingPeer: true
        chaincodeQuery: true
        ledgerQuery: true
        eventSource: true

      peer0.org2.example.com:
        endorsingPeer: true
        chaincodeQuery: true
        ledgerQuery: true
        eventSource: true

      peer1.org2.example.com:
        endorsingPeer: true
        chaincodeQuery: true
        ledgerQuery: true
        eventSource: true

``` 

2. should I declare all the orgs with their peers in organizations section too.
```

# list of participating organizations in this network
#
organizations:
  org1:
    mspid: Org1MSP
    cryptoPath:  peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/{username}@org1.example.com/msp

    peers:
      - peer0.org1.example.com
      - peer1.org1.example.com
  org2:
	mspid: Org2MSP
    cryptoPath:  peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/users/{username}@org2.example.com/msp

    peers:
      - peer0.org2.example.com
      - peer1.org2.example.com
```

<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 10:01:48 GMT):<br/>

one more query "Is sdk-go officially released by HLF community?" 
i'm asking this because I couldn't found documents related(tutorials) for go-sdk.

<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 10:09:14 GMT):<br/>
yes, it's official sdk for go, but luck of documentation means that opensource support is low

<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 10:10:53 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 10:29:40 GMT):<br/>
look here
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 10:30:53 GMT):<br/>
yes, I saw it, but it's cli. What if I build my own fabric management app and want to provide ability for users to see channel details. 
Two ways
1) execute discovery CLI, parse result etc
2) use client  
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 10:32:45 GMT):<br/>
but you can re-use the code
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 10:34:30 GMT):<br/>
you mean import fabric/pkg/discovery/cmd/*.go  inside my app? 
</p>

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 10:34:44 GMT):<br/>
yeah
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 10:35:59 GMT):<br/>
hah, actually this is what I'm doing for managing channels (configtx encoder), I planned to do the same for discovery, but then I saw it in SDK. I thought it would be useful to expose SD client outside. 
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 10:36:07 GMT):<br/>
yes, this is one possible way :) 
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 10:37:47 GMT):<br/>
but usage of client is pretty easy. Build request and parse response, nothing nore 
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 10:37:47 GMT):<br/>
but usage of client is pretty easy. Build request and parse response, nothing more, so why not allow sdk users do it ?

btw I have a weird issue with Service Discovery when I query config. 

`2019-07-30 22:00:39.145 UTC [discovery] configQuery -> ERRO 04b Failed fetching config for channel kekos: config envelope is invalid: key Config.ChannelGroup.Groups[Orderer].Groups is nil`

it's an application channel and it does not have Orderer section inside.

@yacovm so you think that it's  not a good idea to expose Service Discovery client to sdk users?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 11:07:35 GMT):<br/>
hmmm
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 11:08:13 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 11:11:21 GMT):<br/>
oh, got it. anyway I think it's better to have SD client than importing cmd structs from fabric directly. dependency inversion at least :) 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 11:11:43 GMT):<br/>
well you can also import the client directly no?

if you vendor this... won't this solve it?
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 11:12:21 GMT):<br/>
yes, but as @troyronda said above in sdk there is additional context, so you don't need to handle auth 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 11:12:38 GMT):<br/>
i see
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 11:13:16 GMT):<br/>
in sdk context you already have Signing identity, so don't need to handle auth.

If I create a channel using sdk-go then how can I verify it? 
i'm trying to verify it by logging into the peer cli but it is showing below output
```
root@9df955329d92:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer# peer channel list
2019-07-31 11:12:20.860 UTC [channelCmd] InitCmdFactory -> INFO 001 Endorser and orderer connections initialized

``` 
at the same time I'm getting success message in sdk logs. Is it expexted behaviour?
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 11:14:05 GMT):<br/>
it's not hard, but feels more native. 
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 11:15:25 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm can I ask one more question about SD? 
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 11:16:25 GMT):<br/>
what could be a reason that SD returns only one peer in membership while I have multiple? It returns same peer which I'm targeting with query.

</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 11:17:24 GMT):<br/>
broken gossip on my side and peers don't communicate between each other? 
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 11:17:33 GMT):<br/>
maybe I don't understand how it works... found design docs of SD and your video on youtube, will check it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 11:19:22 GMT):<br/>
are you issuing a channel query?
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 11:19:51 GMT):<br/>
`	request := discovery.NewRequest()
	request.OfChannel(channelId)
	request.AddPeersQuery()`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 11:20:16 GMT):<br/>
maybe the other peer hasn't joined the channel
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 11:20:19 GMT):<br/>
the same I see inside SDK when it tries to call getPeers() internally
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 11:20:29 GMT):<br/>
I'm sure it's joined 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 11:20:44 GMT):<br/>
does the peer have external endpoint?
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 11:20:52 GMT):<br/>
I see in peer's logs 'new chain started',  and yes, it has

I'm going through the chainhero setup.go file and I have a query regarding below code
`resourceManagerClientContext := setup.sdk.Context(fabsdk.WithUser(setup.OrgAdmin), fabsdk.WithOrg(setup.OrgName))` 

what actually we r trying to achieve here?
</p>
<p><strong>Psingh</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 16:19:17 GMT):<br/>
here we are passing the identities of an Organization to create a client context which further used to create/update the channel

<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 16:42:29 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda could you tell me what to do regarding this PR: https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/c/fabric-sdk-go/+/32599/2/pkg/fab/discovery/discovery.go#58
Two options: move Request to 3rd_party or create a wrapping struct and wrap all the methods of the Request 
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:05:53 GMT):<br/>
I wonder if we could just embed the internal Request into a new struct. (I haven’t tried that with an internal before).

The alternative would
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:08:19 GMT):<br/>
The alternative would be to restructure the internal discovery client to split out the Request. Ideally such that the split out Request becomes part of the SDK package.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:09:12 GMT):<br/>
Otherwise we need to treat the split out Request more like a proto.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:09:58 GMT):<br/>
(Ie that a package is requiring an out-of-package structure for its methods)

<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:15:19 GMT):<br/>
this requires changing all places where you use internal struct, but  I have  it done too. So can resubmit this  PR
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:19:09 GMT):<br/>
I don't see any reason of returning Request from each method, it's golang, not js where chaining is important. 
`request := NewRequest()
request.OnChannel(ch)
request.DoSomething()
` 
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:19:36 GMT):<br/>
so we can do a bit different API for Request and use it everywhere in SDK, in that way I don't need to proxy all the methods 
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:20:01 GMT):<br/>
Perhaps the signature of Send could be changed to take an interface instead?

I'm going through the `discovery` section of config.yaml .
```
#[Optional] options for retrieving discovery info
      discovery:
        #[Optional] discovery info will be retrieved for these number of random targets
        maxTargets: 2
        #[Optional] retry options for retrieving discovery info
        retryOpts:
          #[Optional] number of retry attempts

@troyronda , @bstasyszyn (or anyone else) - can you guys tell me where in the github repo you have the equivalent file of `core.yaml` ? i.e - is there a `sampleconfig` folder that defines all the configuration? I saw config stuff in various test data, but where is the "authoritative" config file? 
The context is - I want to modify a custom fork of the go SDK to send transactions to all orderers 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 15:12:36 GMT):<br/>
I see lots of `*.yaml` files but I'm wondering where is the file that is used as the ultimate authority 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 15:12:36 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 15:13:46 GMT):<br/>
HLF "documents" it's default conifigs by writing out its own config file, behavior which i still find baffling.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 15:14:09 GMT):<br/>
ok and where is the struct?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 15:14:51 GMT):<br/>
It isn't actually a struct that I can tell. It builds a map when initializing then at some point writes it all out as yaml.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 15:16:46 GMT):<br/>
I don't understand the point to this, since the environment is loaded after this construction happens, which means you end up with a file that contains a bunch of dfeaults that you have to edit to make permanent changes in. Even worse, it means that if upstream decidees to change something, it behaves differently depending if you've ever run the app once or not.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 15:16:59 GMT):<br/>
It is by far the strangest piece of HLF i've found.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 15:17:13 GMT):<br/>
this is not HLF, this is go SDK
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 15:17:22 GMT):<br/>
SDKs are not HLF :rolling_eyes: 
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 15:18:30 GMT):<br/>
in that case, the reponse is usually "reference the test case yaml that is closest to your config" which is usual the config in e2e.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 15:19:13 GMT):<br/>
you said `core.yaml` which generally means the peer. the SDK uses `config.yml` i thought (typically?)
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 15:19:38 GMT):<br/>
so what i meant to ask is - where is the config file that defines everyything
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 15:19:49 GMT):<br/>
in fabric whenever i add a new config parameter, i add it to `core.yaml` or `orderer.yaml`
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 15:20:17 GMT):<br/>
I think I got it: 
```
//ChannelPolicies defines list of policies defined for a channel
type ChannelPolicies struct {
	//Policy for querying channel block
	QueryChannelConfig QueryChannelConfigPolicy
	//Policy for querying discovery
	Discovery DiscoveryPolicy
	//Policy for endorser selection
	Selection SelectionPolicy
	//Policy for event service
	EventService EventServicePolicy
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 15:20:32 GMT):<br/>
its "self" documented in the various test case configs :/

@troyronda @sudeshrshetty guys, I'm just wondering what's the purpose of this condition in endpoint config? 
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/fab/endpointconfig.go#L1447
This function was supposed to match peer with sdk config, but this returns true even peer does not exist in config. 
Is it for discovery service when you have some unknown peers on a channel?  
</p>
<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 22:49:04 GMT):<br/>
@kopaygorodsky search key can be either URL or peer name/ID
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 22:54:13 GMT):<br/>
so for  now it's not clear how to work with endpoint config. 
So I have an app that works only with one org.  I have a list of peers at application startup, so I can put them in config, but the question is idk which peer is joined which channel.
Put them all in peers: [p1, p2,3], org.peers [p1,p2,p3] and channel: default_: [p1,p2,p3] 
</p>

<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 22:55:31 GMT):<br/>
then with service discovery enabled I randomly get 'access denied' on those peers which are not joined to the channel, it depends on maxTartgets property as I understood. Need to specify it as big as possible, so all peers from default list will be queried.

when config isn't able to find peer by URL, it constructs peer config using default settings and URL of the result will be search key...
it is handy when you deal with discovery....
</p>
<p><strong>sudeshrshetty</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 23:07:43 GMT):<br/>
you don't have to define all the peers all the time in SDK config, you can construct peer config on go using entity matchers.
define default peer config variables inside `peer: _default:`

I don't like that for `CreateConfigSignature` I need to specify path to the file which I have in memory. Can we use io.Reader instead? It's must have in Golang projects. 
The same issue with installing chaincode. What If I uploaded my chaincode and keep it in memory, I don't want to save it to some tmp dir and then provide path to this dir and after installation delete it.  It could be replaced with an array of io.Reader

I have a proposal to modify a bit `resMgmtClient`'s API. 
Why does `CreateConfigSignature` require to specify a path to the config file which I have in memory? Can we use io.Reader instead? It's must-have in Golang projects.

@kopaygorodsky I also prefer to have an io.Reader option (and should generally be the primary version). I'd prefer not to unnecessarily create breaking changes though (esp. without deprecating first). It would be nice to add an io.Reader version and refactor the old functions to use it.

@kopaygorodsky You could also consider something similar to the tar package Writer pattern where you call a method for each file (that has an io.Reader signature). This way you don't need to open up all the Readers at once. https://golang.org/pkg/archive/tar/#Writer

How significant are the changes to the Fabric SDK Go from 1.4.2 to 2.0.0? I imagine the upgraded service discovery, chaincode lifecycle, and the new chaincode deployment model are the main changes. Is that right? 
</p>
<p><strong>medikent</strong> (Mon, 12 Aug 2019 17:53:21 GMT):<br/>
I also heard that the Fabric SDK Go is not officially supported and is in more of an alpha state at the moment so it is more recommended to use the Node or Java SDKs. How accurate is that?

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 18:36:41 GMT):<br/>
@kopaygorodsky you can actually override the package that the SDK uses for discovery.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 18:38:00 GMT):<br/>
@kopaygorodsky I haven't thought too deeply about it, but you can override the config provider that the SDK uses.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 18:45:33 GMT):<br/>
Yes FABG-799 could be related. The endpoint config packages pre-loads all the peer configurations at instantiation. https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/658cc4a5662d3face9549246fbcd28ebbe028a3c/pkg/fab/endpointconfig.go#L587 (from https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/658cc4a5662d3face9549246fbcd28ebbe028a3c/pkg/fab/endpointconfig.go#L114)
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 18:49:06 GMT):<br/>
so I can try to create my service that implements all the interfaces and add ability to reload it on the fly
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 18:49:17 GMT):<br/>
right? 
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 19:07:53 GMT):<br/>
it's almost 2k lines of code to override

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 19:28:16 GMT):<br/>
The reload scenario is probably not tested but the idea was that you could provide the interface implementation.
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 19:43:34 GMT):<br/>
yea, but that's almost 2k lines of code. I'll try to embed exiting EndpointConfig implementation into my and override a bit, hope it will work

Seems I need to override only ChannelPeers(name string) method, it's used by Service Discovery internally. For all other clients/methods in SDK I can pass option WithTargetEndpoint() and avoid static discovery.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:33:13 GMT):<br/>
if you know at least one peer joined in a channel you can ask it what other peers are in the channel too, no?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:33:24 GMT):<br/>
@kopaygorodsky 
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:34:28 GMT):<br/>
yes, but how do I know at least one? I don't store any info about membership offchain 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:34:49 GMT):<br/>
you don't know any peer at all?
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:35:15 GMT):<br/>
I have a list of peers in my org, but I don't know which channels they joined 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:35:25 GMT):<br/>
can't you ask them all?
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:35:34 GMT):<br/>
yes, that's what I was thinking for 
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:35:34 GMT):<br/>
yes, that's what I was thinking of 
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:35:58 GMT):<br/>
specify all of them as default peers for any channel, then Service Discovery will be asking them every time
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:36:36 GMT):<br/>
you can't ask peer `A` if peer `B` is in a channel that peer `A` is not in that channel though because it cannot know if you are authorized to know that or not
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:39:11 GMT):<br/>
yes, and I'll get access denied for peer `A`
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:39:11 GMT):<br/>
yes, and I'll get access denied for peer `A`, then I run a query for `B`  
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:44:18 GMT):<br/>
imagine I have [A, B, C, D, <>] peers, I need to ask each of them every time if they joined a specified channel.
If at least one of them returned a success response, I can assume that this peer is on that channel. 
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:44:49 GMT):<br/>
This works right now with manual config

<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:45:15 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:45:15 GMT):<br/>
so for any channel all of them are asked about membership, not very efficient, but works. Later mb I'll store their membership in some db
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:46:04 GMT):<br/>
you can also ask a peer of your organization, about the list of all peers without channel membership
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:46:12 GMT):<br/>
it's a non-channel query
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:46:25 GMT):<br/>
yes, that's another way 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:46:35 GMT):<br/>
in the discovery CLI you just don't pass a --channel parameter
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:47:10 GMT):<br/>
if you do it only upon the startup of your SDK / application i think this is not that bad
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:47:26 GMT):<br/>
yes, but how to keep it updated? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:47:34 GMT):<br/>
why do you need to keep it updated?
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 20:47:42 GMT):<br/>
I add/delete peers without restarting my app

Hello,
I get errors when I try to create an sdk object with a connection profile without any users/cryptopath.
This is likely due to this check:
```
	if orgConfig.CryptoPath == "" && len(orgConfig.Users) == 0 {
		return nil, errors.New("Either a cryptopath or an embedded list of users is required")
	}
```
here : `https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/msp/identitymgr.go#L42`

However, my application works fine without any user (it can generate valid certificates on the fly)
This is confirmed by the fact that my workaround is currently defining dummy users or an invalid cryptopath.

This seems like a weird check to perform, is there a more official workaround? Or can this check be removed in a future patch?
</p>
<p><strong>CMajeri</strong> (Sat, 17 Aug 2019 13:33:30 GMT):<br/>
Simply removing these 3 lines seems to work. It seems odd to require a cryptopath/list of user on creation, when errors are already raised when trying to use a non-defined user

thank @troyronda : can you tell me where I can find the HLF SDK Go CI server ? I could then to see how I can run integration test on HLF 1.4 and finally try to run it on an HLF 2.0-alpha ? 
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 15:56:08 GMT):<br/>
You can run locally with make integration-tests-prerelease, but first the versions need to be updated in the fixture files (particularly Makefile and the dockerenv folder).
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 16:11:02 GMT):<br/>
It also looks like configtx.yaml will need updates for v2.

The externalized fabric-protos-go removed the PayloadVisibility field of the ChaincodeHeaderExtension struct, which caused the following error when compiling my client code: `vendor/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pkg/fab/txn/txn.go:78:79: hdrExt.PayloadVisibility undefined (type *peer.ChaincodeHeaderExtension has no field or method PayloadVisibility)`.  The project fabric-protos-go does not have any tags or branches that I can go back to.  What can I do?
</p>
<p><strong>yxuco</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 13:47:41 GMT):<br/>
Would this external dependency on fabric-protos-go@master make fabric-sdk-go more fragile, unless the dependency is on a specific tagged version of the protos-go?

Hi. I am facing an issue, that sometimes when invoking chaincode, I get an error message on grpc level like: "certificate signed by unknown authority". For me it seems that the sdk tries to talk to a peer node of another organization. Since TLS is enabled I wonder where my fabric-sdk gets the  ca-tls-cert of the other organizations, because initially it only knows the CA-tls-certs of its "own" organization (through the custom-endpoint). But when the discovery service tries to discover new peers of the known channels, it calls "customEndpoint.PeerConfig(<peername>)" at some point. But I am not able to set a tls-cert of the given peer, since I do not know it.  What is the correct way to handle this?
</p>

I was also hoping to see fabric merge the protos change, and from there figure out what to do with the remainder of the third_party directory (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/tree/master/third_party/github.com/hyperledger/fabric)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 19:39:58 GMT):<br/>
We had copies of some Fabric utilities due to the protos being part of the SDK. Now we will have the same protos...

There hasn't been as many decisions to make lately. (the SDK has mainly stabilized as the core bits have been built out). We generally talk with each other and see if there are topics in this chat room.

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 20:47:45 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 20:48:00 GMT):<br/>
I'll attempt to take a critical look at it, but "setting up the sdk" is usually my biggest issue, followed by "how do I get an sdk config"
</p>

non-standard system chaincodes. I use the regular ones all the time. Seem to be hardcoded tho.

@troyronda I wonder how you would avoid the following runtime error.  My client app uses fabric/protos/utils to process BlockEvents, which apparently also registers proto stucts.  So when used with fabric-sdk-go together, it prints out the following errors and panics at startup.  I guess that I can either re-write the code to avoid calling fabric/protos/utils, or go back to alpha5 version of fabric-sdk-go. Thanks. `2019/08/27 14:26:17 proto: duplicate proto type registered: common.MSPRole
2019/08/27 14:26:17 proto: duplicate proto type registered: common.MSPIdentityAnonymity

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 21:30:36 GMT):<br/>
@yxuco I hope fabric master makes use of the fabric-protos-go soon. Note: It is now called protoutil.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 21:30:44 GMT):<br/>
FYI: The SDK has an internal copy of protoutil that does use fabric-protos-go at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/tree/master/internal/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protoutil
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 21:31:07 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 21:31:07 GMT):<br/>
(Of course, this cannot be directly imported into an external project due to the internal path)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 21:44:56 GMT):<br/>
As a historical note, the previous SDK version maintained a second copy of the protos with the registered names prefixed to avoid collisions.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 21:48:51 GMT):<br/>
The idea now is that with one source of go protos, projects importing that same source will only have protos registered once... and names will no longer collide.
</p>
<p><strong>yxuco</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 04:34:48 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda Thanks for the pointer. will change my client code to replace the reference of fabric/protos.

<p><strong>yxuco</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 02:20:50 GMT):<br/>
@abel23 I was wondering about the same question a few months ago.  I think that the paper-net sample can be implemented in Go, using ABAC, although I have not seen anyone tried to put it together.  It is missing a Go utility for managing wallet of x509 keys similar to the js utility used by the paper-net sample.  However, you can generate the user keys by using a CA server.  For example, start the byfn network with "-a" option, and then generate the keys for paper-net users of the 2 bank orgs, and then write your chaincode to call cid lib API that extracts and verifies user attributes in paper-net transactions.  With that said, I wish that fabric-sdk-go would provide a utility to support wallet similar to the js sdk.

<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Fri, 06 Sep 2019 19:30:02 GMT):<br/>
To my knowledge the go sdk just passes along the args to the peer and they should match what your chaincode is expecting

@mattmaru For #1, you can use either a composite-key or rich-query to retrieve states by specified fields, however, you need to pre-define the composite-key or Couchdb index for the query fields to avoid a full database scan.  For #2, you can do a range query by specifying a range that covers all possible key values.

My org is one of those who has questions about the SDK's status, stability, and durability as it compares to the officially supported Java and Node SDKs
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:46:48 GMT):<br/>
Its a matter of perspective. Some people think "stable" means "hasn't changed in 3 years" some think "stable" means "they've released 3 major releases in as many months". Both can be misleading metrics.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:47:18 GMT):<br/>
Actual stability can only be measured by your own use cases.
</p>
<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:47:40 GMT):<br/>
I agree on your first point.
</p>
<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:48:48 GMT):<br/>
Certainly there is a reason why Java and Node are the officially supported SDKs. 
</p>
<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:49:32 GMT):<br/>
They've met some sort of metric within the project for that to be a thing.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:49:37 GMT):<br/>
I'm not certain that reason is stability or durability, both have been around longer and just got embedded in all of the tutorials early on.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:50:14 GMT):<br/>
Also, the barriers to entry for node and java are lower since there are a lot of students that use both over golang. Most get as far as the tutorials and move on.
</p>
<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:50:25 GMT):<br/>
They're also officially released, and don't have an alpha status though. 
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:50:45 GMT):<br/>
IMO "alpha" means nothing, its just a word.

<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:52:37 GMT):<br/>
I wouldn't disagree as far as exceptions, but I would say that the vast, vast majority of the world over looks at those designations as a way to determine the maturity and viability of a release. 
</p>

I agree, though, that the gosdk "branding" leaves a lot to be desired, and they should have tagged a real realease months ago.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:52:58 GMT):<br/>
if not a year ago
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:53:12 GMT):<br/>
That critcism is absolutely warranted.
</p>
<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:54:29 GMT):<br/>
Would you have any insight then to the roadmap? 
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:54:39 GMT):<br/>
If i was a maintainer, I would be concerned with image/optics. I'm not, in this case, just a end user dev, so i care about what the code actually does, and not what the latest tag looks like.
</p>
<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:54:48 GMT):<br/>
ah
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:54:50 GMT):<br/>
Nope, i have none, just an outside dev.
</p>
<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:54:55 GMT):<br/>
gotcha
</p>
<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:55:05 GMT):<br/>
Have you used any of the other SDKs? 
</p>
<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:55:26 GMT):<br/>
rather . . have you used the Java or Node SDKs at all?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:55:42 GMT):<br/>
the node one is all over the map, half of the examples are broken. Java instantiation of chain code documentation is lacking
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:56:11 GMT):<br/>
i'm more familiar with golang than java or node so im sticking with that.
</p>
<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:56:12 GMT):<br/>
The Go docs leave a bit to be desired as well (speaking from experience)
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:56:16 GMT):<br/>
yes for sure
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:56:32 GMT):<br/>
they overly depend on selfdocumenting go :(
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:56:55 GMT):<br/>
and they are sorely lacking in examples, and there are NO real working hlf go sdk tutorials (that i know of)
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:57:13 GMT):<br/>
(other than what is the the gosdk repo itself)
</p>
<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:57:49 GMT):<br/>
I couldn't agree more with those points 
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:57:58 GMT):<br/>
Far too many "examples" are buried in test cases
</p>
<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:58:02 GMT):<br/>
I have a list as well ;) 
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:58:06 GMT):<br/>
hehe yep
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:58:18 GMT):<br/>
top of my list is error reporting but that is a problem with fabric in general not just the sdk
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:58:35 GMT):<br/>
its almost impossible to figure out what went wrong w/o 1) reading code 2) adding more debugging
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:58:41 GMT):<br/>
thats my #1 complaint right now
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:58:57 GMT):<br/>
The stabilty is actually quite good in my experience
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 22:59:15 GMT):<br/>
99% of the issues are cert and/or config file related
</p>
<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 23:00:41 GMT):<br/>
I think once you can get something to work with the SDK, it seems to work consistently
</p>
<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 23:03:12 GMT):<br/>
I appreciate the conversation and perspective, for sure
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 23:28:24 GMT):<br/>
I use the sdk to talk to a chaincode. works for our cases. 
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 23:28:51 GMT):<br/>
generally when I write an example or some tiny program for it, I copy the existing setup and paste it into a new main. 
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Mon, 09 Sep 2019 23:29:14 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>yxuco</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 04:53:06 GMT):<br/>
I like go-sdk for a few obvious reasons, and we are using it to develop a UI modeling tool that hides the details of the implementation programming language, and allows user to implement fabric apps (both chaincode and client app) using graphical modeling.  The project is open-source at: https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/dovetail-contrib/tree/develop/hyperledger-fabric.  I think that the go-sdk had served us very well, although I had to look at the source code to figure out how to do things, and I would like to see a 1.0 release tag sometime soon, so I do not have to regularly check if our tool still works with the latest go-sdk code :-)

Yes - the config processor is viper.

This is probably the wrong approach, typically localhost in a SAN is not recommended. You really want to assign every endpoint a real DNS hostname.

Hi all, I recently tried implementing sdk-go with a chaincode I had written earlier. Upon trying to query using the Query function, I got an error saying: “Transaction processing for endorser [localhost:8051]: Chaincode status Code: (500) UNKNOWN. Description: function not found” I then realized that the chaincode was not installed correctly, even though the part of the code dealing with instantiation and initiation had returned no error. In fact, even if no chaincode file exists in the given path, a chaincode is shown to be instantiated in the peers. I was wondering if someone has a tip on how to proceed with solving this error; any suggestion would be greatly appreciated.

<p><strong>medikent</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:33:48 GMT):<br/>
Is having the '@' symbol in various paths from *config.yaml* intentional or is that accidental complexity? This causes a difficult situation when using Kubernetes with Fabric.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:41:24 GMT):<br/>
You mean as identities? It's perfectly legal but not necessary. Not surprised kubernetes has issues, they can't seem to get a lot of things right.
</p>
<p><strong>medikent</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:42:56 GMT):<br/>
Do you mean Kubernetes not getting things right?
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:43:28 GMT):<br/>
yes. e.g. service names not being able to have more than one dot. Completely broken
</p>
<p><strong>medikent</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:43:40 GMT):<br/>
lol, Kubernetes is way less broken than Fabric.
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:43:42 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:45:20 GMT):<br/>
specifically for fabric if your endpoint has more than one dot

hopefully he doesn't say hairpin
</p>
<p><strong>medikent</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:46:19 GMT):<br/>
He just says don't use dots in the names ever. He says it has to be DNS compatible so non-standard names will kill it.

<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:53:13 GMT):<br/>
the core hlf components don't care

<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:53:22 GMT):<br/>
that sounds like a good candidate for a new bug
</p>
<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:53:33 GMT):<br/>
I'd be happy to file it :) 
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:53:38 GMT):<br/>
But there is some internal construct stuff going on with <user>@org
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:53:47 GMT):<br/>
so that is likely the issue
</p>
<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:53:49 GMT):<br/>
gotcha
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:54:05 GMT):<br/>
where <user> and <org> are parameterized
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:54:35 GMT):<br/>
that is likely the root cause if i had to guess, because that is unique to the sdk (afaik, i dont know if the otther sdks do this)
</p>
<p><strong>dsessions</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:54:52 GMT):<br/>
We haven't tried other SDKs to know
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:55:28 GMT):<br/>
i THINK it is only one way tho, that is to say, user and org are combined to make an identity, but an identity is not split apart ever in the sdk
</p>
<p><strong>nyet</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:56:25 GMT):<br/>
In any case i really appreciate you finding this since it will affect our k8s roadmap

Hello
</p>
<p><strong>mffrench</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 17:37:24 GMT):<br/>
I'm looking a way to handle couchdb index using hlf sdk go but contrary to nodejs sdk where there is a `metadataPath` field in the install request I don't see such in go sdk install request : 

```
type InstallCCRequest struct {
	Name    string
	Path    string
	Version string
	Package *resource.CCPackage
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>mffrench</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 17:39:07 GMT):<br/>
also I don't see any json file in the test so it's seems to me this feature is not covered by HLF SDK go 
</p>
<p><strong>mffrench</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 17:39:39 GMT):<br/>
can you confirm that ? if yes can you point me some way to enable such feature ?

Hi everyone, 

I'm trying to build a system chaincode, and now the code is very large so I was thinking of using `dep` for package management. 
So my Gopkg.toml is : https://hastebin.com/gahiqufana.cs
And Gopkg.lock: https://hastebin.com/imetetuxiz.cs

I'm building the plugin using:  
```
go build -buildmode=plugin -o myscc.so main.go
```

But when I run the peer I'm getting the error:
```

My Guess is that it's because of the external library, but we would like to have a way to test our getQueryResults method "along with several other methods" and the implementation is needed to be able to have enough code coverage to be able to promote the project to a production environment.

Since we need this for our project we're willing to develop it, however I'd rather not implement it in a way that wouldn't be accepted as part of the project.

Bingo.  I  put in the same project the source code of the chaincode and the source code of the apps using SDK.
I wrote a pkg that encapsulated the calls to the chaincode via SDK.  To use in this pkg some of the types retruned by smart contracts and also the constants, I imported a package from the chaincode.  THis raised the issue.
I solved it by making a copy of this information in a .go file that I added to my SDK-based package.  It works.
Does some body have an elegant method to "import" types, errors and constants from the chaincode into the apps using SDK?

Hi guys, is there any progress of refatoring fabric-sdk-go?
</p>
<p><strong>EltonSearcy</strong> (Fri, 11 Oct 2019 21:20:55 GMT):<br/>
To my question Above.

my goal is to find out how and where you guys would like to have it implemented.
We have the mockstub implemented and are using it in our project, but want to make it available for more people to use since its a serious issue to not have.


- We are very open to implementing this mockstub in the core chaincode library or even in a library such as github.com/s7techlab/cckit
- We've also considered that creating a mocking framework project for go chaincode may be a good idea..  if we want to decouple the main chaincode from mocking.

hello.When the endorsement policy is set to AND 
```
"AND ('Org1MSP.peer','Org2MSP.peer')",
```
I am a Org1 node, I don't know the certificate and private key of the Org2 node. If I want to call the invoke method of the Chaincode, I need to collect the endorsement results of 2 nodes. How can I achieve the code?
Sdk only provides the Execute method,But need to configure org2 information in the configuration file.
```
func (cc *Client) Execute(request Request, options ...RequestOption) (Response, error) {
	options = append(options, addDefaultTimeout(fab.Execute))
	options = append(options, addDefaultTargetFilter(cc.context, filter.EndorsingPeer))
	return callExecute(cc, request, options...)
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Tue, 15 Oct 2019 10:46:37 GMT):<br/>
As I know SDK collects endorsement results under the hood. In my case Service Discovery takes care of it by targeting needed peers

@kopaygorodsky hey, we've been thinking about the best approach to this. The thing is, we don't like that SDK has fabric code in its codebase. We would prefer that fabric was written in a modular way, where common libraries used by e.g. peer, orderer, command line tools, etc., are in its own project(s), and peer, orderer, SDK, etc. use them from there. Fabric already started a bit on this, externalizing fabric-protos-go and creating fabric-lib-go as a placeholder project where fabric libraries will eventually reside.

Here is the JIRA ticket which describes this need from the SDK point of view https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-16461. Basically, we are saying that SDK needs parts of the fabric functionality, but the only way to use it currently is to copy the code into the SDK codebase. We would rather remove all copies of fabric code from SDK and import them from fabric-lib-go. In retrospect, exposing parts of fabric configtxgen and configtxlator codebase in SDK might have been an error. Now you are asking that the SDK exposes more fabric functions. If we keep it up, SDK will soon become a dump for fabric functions whose happy home should be fabric-lib-go.

Perhaps it's time that people start creating pull requests in fabric-lib-go for functions they need to use from there. My company is working on some projects which will need some common fabric go functions, so we are very interested in contributing. However, we also want to move fast, that is, we don't want to be dependent on possibly long delays caused by necessary process bottlenecks like code reviews, design considerations, etc. So we decided to start a repository with our own flavour of fabric-lib-go (building it using the same code-copy mechanism used by SDK) and use fabric functions from there until they become available in hyperledger. SDK will for now keep what's there, but at some point we should probably deprecate configtxgen and configtxlator functions in SDK.

Any thoughts?

Hi, I am trying to implement a couch db query to use skip and limits for the pagination. When executing the same query against my local couch db instance, it returns a limited list and skips properly. But, after going through the getQueryResults of the chaincode, it's showing all the records ignoring the skip and limit. Does fabric support limit and skip for the pagination or is it just bookmark..?

@aleksandar.likic thank you for your reply. I agree, it feels weird when  SDK is built on top of internal packages  which are copy of fabric. 
Do you opensource your `fabric-lib-go`?
I see that original one is almost empty, idk even where to start and what intensions of fabric community regarding this repo.

@kopaygorodsky I am not a maintainer of hyperledger/fabric-lib-go. It is true, it has almost nothing there and it's hard to tell when and how quickly it will grow. To be independent of its progress, we started https://github.com/trustbloc/fabric-lib-go-ext. It's just a shell at the moment, with a single PR which is a work in progress. Our intention is to contribute to hyperledger/fabric-lib-go as well, but frankly our priority will be our own flavour of it so we are not blocked on the progress of the hyperledger/fabric-lib-go. I imagine there will be lengthy discussions on how to best organize it, what exactly goes into it and such.

Hey @Tom-Xu-CNXA are you referring to the features provided by the "new programming model" functionality? (Link below). The Programming model squad responsible for delivering the high-level APIs provided in the node/java sdks are planning on providing the same for go - and we're hoping to present this proposal at a contributors meeting soon

Create transaction structures and flows which avoid concurrently editing the same key/record. Avoid that at all cost. That solved it for me.

Service discovery in go sdk
Where I can find any tutorial of using service discovery with go sdk? I can't understand how that changes ordinary workflow without discovery service. At least examples are needed
I don't specify peers urls in orinary flow (get channel client, execute query/invoke). So, how service discovery can simplify anything?

</p>
<p><strong>bstasyszyn</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 22:22:44 GMT):<br/>
By default, the SDK uses service discovery to select peers for endorsements. Service discovery looks at the endorsement policy of a chaincode and (randomly) selects a minimal set of peers that satisfies the policy. If you wish, you can override discovery and provide the specific peers that you wish to endorse the proposal. Service discovery is something that you don't need to think about unless you wish to override default behavior.

Go 1.13.4 works fine, but Go 1.12.6 gives me the above issue.
</p>
<p><strong>yxuco</strong> (Sat, 23 Nov 2019 04:39:22 GMT):<br/>
On the contrary, fabric v1.4.4 works only with Go1.12.x, so I had to change Go version when toggle between apps that use these 2 packages.

</p>
<p><strong>glin</strong> (Mon, 25 Nov 2019 11:15:03 GMT):<br/>
Hi, I see from the chat history that it is stable enough and lack of documents is preventing release of stable version. Is this as good as the node.js SDK or does it have any features missing as compared to node.js SDK?
</p>
<p><strong>heatherp</strong> (Mon, 25 Nov 2019 16:44:20 GMT):<br/>
Hey @glin The go sdk does not currently provide the high-level programming model features, as explained here: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/developapps/application.html which is available in the node sdk (fabric-network) and gateway-java. We are planning on implementing it though, and we're hoping to present that proposal at a fabric contributors call soon

Hi @metadata, the configuration of the raft service is done in the underlying fabric network (docker containers) if you do the configuration there, then it is easy to connect to this network using the go-sdk. You don't have to modify the config.yaml of the sdk. Except if you want the sdk to talk to a specific orderer
</p>

you can list more than 1 orderers in the config.yaml file for redundancy. But I don't know the details of how this is handled by the sdk, which orderer is used if more than one is listed. Someone from the sdk team could help here.

check the documentation for the QueryTransaction function. You will see that it returns a [ProcessedTransaction](https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-protos-go/peer#ProcessedTransaction) which includes an envelop that I guess you can unmarshal and get the payload

1) In the past I was not able to use the go sdk to communicate with a non-TLS fabric network. Is this still the case?
2) Does the go sdk work with the new chaincode lifecycle? As in does it work with contracts that no longer have the init & invoke interface?

Hi All, I'm getting below Discovery logs.

In a Go project, if fabric-sdk-go is imported, once "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/utils" is also imported in the same project, an error of 'panic: proto: duplicate enum registered: common.MSPPrincipal_Classification' will be thrown during compiling the Go project. I think the problem is caused duplicated files in 'fabric-protos-go' or others. 
So, do you have any solution on this? 
Thanks!

`github.com/hyperledger/fabric/protos/utils` cannot be imported with `fabric-sdk-go` together in a project, otherwise, an error likes `panic: proto: duplicate enum registered: common.MSPPrincipal_Classification` will be thrown. Since there is conflict with `github.com/hyperledger/fabric-protos-go`. 
Anyone experienced the same issue?
Thanks!

<p><strong>bstasyszyn</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 18:56:27 GMT):<br/>
There are two different thing: 1) Event service - which you specified to be the deliver service from Fabric and (2) Discovery 
</p>
<p><strong>bstasyszyn</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 18:56:53 GMT):<br/>
The type of Discovery is selected based on channel capabilities...
</p>
<p><strong>bstasyszyn</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 18:57:48 GMT):<br/>
If you have the V1_2 application capability defined in the channel then Fabric's discovery service is used - otherwise static discovery is used

1. Is there any integration test available to follow? 
2. I have added all the nodes in config.yaml file. Any other config is required?
3. How sdk-go switches between nodes if one of the node is down. Is it using any load-balancing thing?

I think for 1.4.4 you should still use 
```
import "github.com/hyperledger/fabric/core/chaincode/shim"
``` 
and make sure in your go.mod you require `github.com/hyperledger/fabric v1.4.4`
I think the new fabric-chaincode-go repo is for v2.0.0, as you can see in the fabric repo, the v1.4.4 tag still has the core/chaincode/shim folder...

@braduf `fabric-chaincode-go` and `fabric-protots-go` are working with `v1.4.3` too. I think you can use them with any `1.4.x` as they are libraries.

Hi everyone,

I am requesting that we enter the final comment period for the RFC to implement the Fabric Programming Model into the Go SDK, link: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-rfcs/pull/14. We're looking for any final comments, objections, and support 🙂, from those interested in fabric-go-sdk development
I'm proposing that it is merged at the end of this period, in one week. 

Please reach out to @andrew-coleman or me with any queries

2. If a Node/Java dev is moving to Go then he/she has to deal with `Pointers` and In current scenario, the go-sdk is revolves around pointer.  Is it going to be addressed too?

3. How it is going to impact the current go-sdk users? I'm talking about the community support and regular updates. 
yes, The idea is good as there is no proper documentation available for go-sdk hence it is pretty hard for node/java dev's to switch to go-sdk.

<p><strong>andrew-coleman</strong> (Tue, 14 Jan 2020 15:33:50 GMT):<br/>
1. Yes, the Gateway SDK will be implemented using the existing APIs.  There will be no breaking changes to the existing SDK/APIs
2. The Go Gateway SDK will have the same concepts and structures as the Node/Java Gateway SDK, but will use idiomatic Go syntax.  So it will use pointers since they are fundamental to Go.  Java/Node will continue to be supported and developed so users can stay with those if they don't like Go syntax.
3. The Go Gateway SDK will be fully documented and supported.  It is intended to extend the 'Developing Applications' chapter of the official Fabric documentation site with this SDK

Hi, I got a question concerning querying and the selection of peers in the sdk. When just querying chaincode a peer does not have to be an endorsing peer, but in the sdk code the peers seems to be filtered by the organisation that are contained within the current endorsment policy.
</p>
<p><strong>Retonator</strong> (Tue, 14 Jan 2020 16:26:51 GMT):<br/>
Is this how it should work or possible a bug?

@andrew-coleman for someone starting now to develop an app using the Go SDK, would you recommend waiting for the new programming model? Is it ok to start using the SDK as it is right now and then transfer to the new model as soon as it is implemented?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 22:07:49 GMT):<br/>
Hey Go SDK developers, FYI - you can now ask discovery to skip filtering out peers that are not in the collection but have a collection reference in the same query.
This is a bit of a niche, but it can be used to make an endorsement query for a transaction that performs private data "blind write" on a chaincode that has a collection level endorsement policy (thus you need to pass the collections in the query). Before this change, any peer not in the collection was filtered out whenever you specified a collection. 
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/538/commits/26fc7a50260aa41322c6e27fdcd6803b5f9255cf
The added support is via a new flag in the protobuf - `NoPrivateReads` in the `ChaincodeCall` struct. 

Now, although this is merged, the support for collection level endorsement policy is yet to be merged, but you can already start implementing this in the Go SDK.
In addition, since this adds a new protobuf field - there is no API break because this field is `false` by default.

Hello
I am getting started to work with the go-sdk, I have hard time to start:
1. I didn't find any documentation for the go sdk, I found only 1 very old tutorial that seem to be not up to date, is there any good resources? 
2. We need to listen to blocks events and get the TX data, I saw that unlike the NODE sdk, the data in the events is raw, is there any utility that can help me get it?

when we used 2.0.0 cryptogen to generate certificates, go sdk still looks for hashcode named private key, but 2.0.0 cryptogen is no longer doing that, now the private key file is named priv_sk.

I am already using the revoke method and it's working fine. 

The problem, as far as I can tell, is that there's no `GenCRL` field in the `msp.RevocationRequest`.  The `msp.RevocationResponse`, which has `RevokedCerts` and `CRL` fields, comes with an empty `[]byte` for the `CRL`. 
</p>
<p><strong>metadata</strong> (Fri, 07 Feb 2020 13:48:54 GMT):<br/>
ok. even I'm curious how they are generating the CRL by itself. though they are sending it in `RevocationResponse` and  you have already mentioned it nil.

Hi Everyone, thanks for creating this forum. I posted this question on Stack Overflow and I was wondering if anyone here had a different answer? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60075552/how-to-connect-a-go-client-application-to-the-ibm-vs-code-fabric-extension

Hi is there a way to convert a common.block into readable structured data? If I try to get the struct into json, I get base64 values. When I try to decode them, it is a blob containing readable and non-readable characters. Is there a way to get structured information of a block?

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 11:07:52 GMT):<br/>
@nikolas use configtxlator to decode common.block to json, however each tx invocation paparameters will be still base64 encoded. You will need to use jq to decide each field.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 11:08:12 GMT):<br/>
Decode

<p><strong>nikolas</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 11:08:37 GMT):<br/>

Minifabric does all these for you already.

Oh. 
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 11:10:13 GMT):<br/>
What I did in minifabric was to use configtxlator decode into json, then extract fields that I need, then decode each tx invocation fields.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 11:11:25 GMT):<br/>
I would think that you can use configtxlator code (which is in go) do the same.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 11:12:56 GMT):<br/>
Minifabric is a tool that I created recently. You can take a look here https://github.com/litong01/minifabric

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 11:14:06 GMT):<br/>
Once you do minifab up, you can try to use minifab invoke and minifab blockquery to see blocks on your ledger.

Hi Maintainers, it looks like the integration tests for `fabric-sdk-go` have been failing in the Azure Pipelines build since December.  I think it is caused by the added support for Java/Node chaincode (FABG-736/932/785).  The docker images `fabric-javaenv` and `fabric-nodeenv` are not getting pulled which I suspect has a bearing, but also there are other errors.  Is there work underway to fix this?  @troyronda @aleksandar.likic @yakumioto  Thanks!

Hi, I am trying to install `Node/Javascript Chaincode` via this fabric-sdk-go, it seems that installation got succeed, but it cannot be instantiated.  
There might be some `path` problems, I tried several path patterns, and hacked some path validation, and made a Node type chaincode package, it can be installed without error, but when instantiation, there always be 2 kinds of errors: the first likes `msg chaincode registration failed: container exited with 254`, and another possible error is `cp: cannot stat '/chaincode/input/src/`.
Have anyone same experiences? Do have any easy way to install `Node language chaincode` via this fabric-sdk-go?
Thanks a lot!
</p>
<p><strong>Tom-Xu-CNXA</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 15:16:15 GMT):<br/>

@tongli - would I be able to add a Go client application (REST api) to communicate with the network / CC on Minifab?

And also, does it use the CA? (my application creates and registers users)
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Fri, 14 Feb 2020 02:06:08 GMT):<br/>
Minifabric create a fully functional fabric network. You can add new org to it and new peers to join it. You can use any app to access the network and minifabric even creates an connection profile for gosdk based the application.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Fri, 14 Feb 2020 23:43:03 GMT):<br/>
Can I use the fabric-ca client / server with it?
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Sat, 15 Feb 2020 01:04:56 GMT):<br/>
Absolutely . It is a fully functional fabric network.

Can I sign arbitrary bytes with my private key using sdk? I tried to use msp.SigningIdentity `Sign` method, but it's not implemented. 
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 10:06:50 GMT):<br/>
I am running a network on Minifabric and I'm getting this error when trying to enroll a user: `Post https://ca.org1.example.com:7054/enroll: x509: certificate is valid for tlsca.org1.example.com, not ca.org1.example.com`

Clearly this points to some TLS handshake error, which I would assume means I'm using the wrong tlsa certificate in the certficateAuthorities section of my connection profile. However, I've tried changing that path to point to a completely different certificate but I still get the same error.

Basically, I can't figure out where the go sdk is taking this certificate from - can anyone shed some light?
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 10:25:56 GMT):<br/>
okay, I finally managed to get past this error by setting a different `FABRIC_CA_SERVER_TLS_KEYFILE` & `FABRIC_CA_SERVER_TLS_CERTFILE` in the minifab setup.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 13:02:10 GMT):<br/>
All certs are saved in vars/keyfiles directory since they were produced by cryptogen
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 13:20:47 GMT):<br/>
Hey @tongli - sorry to be the bane of your life right now! :-)
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 13:21:13 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I saw all the certs there but I think I tried all of them at some point.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 13:22:17 GMT):<br/>
The only way I could get it to work was changing the above parameters to use like:

```
FABRIC_CA_SERVER_TLS_KEYFILE=/certs/ca/{{ allkeys[item.org].pkey.split('/')[-1] }}
FABRIC_CA_SERVER_TLS_CERTFILE=/certs/ca/ca.{{ item.org }}-cert.pem
```
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 13:22:28 GMT):<br/>
i.e. using the ca certs instead of tlsca.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 13:24:09 GMT):<br/>
it seems those 'original' tlsca certs on the server are signed to use tlsca.org1.example.com
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 13:29:57 GMT):<br/>
Depends on how and where you want to connect to. If you connect to ca, you need to use the ca tls key.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 13:30:28 GMT):<br/>
If you can’t use the tls key, then it should be a bug.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 13:34:06 GMT):<br/>
I'm working with the Go SDK - a Go application proving a restapi. This was whilst just trying to register / enroll a user with the CA.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 13:34:35 GMT):<br/>
as far as I can tell, minifab doesn't bring up any server or endpoints with tlsca.xxx
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 13:34:58 GMT):<br/>
Right. So the connection profiles were made including all the peer and orderer nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 13:35:30 GMT):<br/>
I did not include all the ca nodes info in it. I should have added that.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 13:35:44 GMT):<br/>
I've added that, no worries.

best thing is to compare both files (IBP vs go-sdk) and check the difference
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 08:27:57 GMT):<br/>
I'm aware that the go sdk doesn't quite conform to the connection profile standard and so the connection profiles require slight modification to work and these only work with the Go SDK. 
</p>

@davidkel  Is the new go-sdk-programming model  suggested by @andrew-coleman in progress? 
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 08:46:12 GMT):<br/>
It is, so hopefully they will fix the issues with the connection profile but we will see
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 08:46:12 GMT):<br/>
It is, I see that a PR has been merged with some initial stuff
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 09:00:12 GMT):<br/>
I was doing a bit of work on this and I was able to get an exported connection profile from Minifab (https://github.com/litong01/minifabric) to work with the Go SDK. I would have thought that given the right information and certs, that this profile (which was written based on the links in that SO question) couldn't be updated to work with other networks. But I haven't tried it.... ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 09:01:32 GMT):<br/>
For example, I'm not sure of the consequences of the comment, "Wallets are not compatible with the Go SDK currently."
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 10:18:36 GMT):<br/>
The Go SDK doesn't have the the wallet concept provided by fabric-gateway-java and fabric-network (from node) as so doesn't have the api's yet, nor can it work with the persisted format on the filesystem. As the Go SDK is to get the new programming api available in node and java, the ability to work with persisted wallets as well as import identities in the same way as the other implemetations will come
</p>
<p><strong>dileban</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 10:51:41 GMT):<br/>
Have you written any code/script that converts a connection profile to a form required by the Go SDK?
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 11:10:20 GMT):<br/>
well, in my case the connection profile is ostensibly the same - I've tried using the same for a JS api and a Go api. Just that the Golang one has more information.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 11:12:37 GMT):<br/>
this is the template that is used in Minifabric: https://github.com/litong01/minifabric/blob/master/playbooks/ops/profilegen/templates/goprofileyaml.j2
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 11:32:25 GMT):<br/>
As an example, cryptopath is not a standard connection profile entry. Therefore is should be optional, not mandatory and should have started with `x-`
```
"organizations":
{% for org in allorgs %}
{%  set orgelements = allkeys.values() | selectattr('org', 'equalto', org) | list %}
  "{{ org }}":
    "mspid": "{{ org.split('.')|join('') }}"
    "cryptoPath": "{{ org }}/users/{username}@{{ org}}/msp"
```
</p>
<p><strong>dileban</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 11:36:58 GMT):<br/>
Is there a straight forward way to run the Ansible code where I could just feed it a connection profile JSON and it would spit out the corresponding .yaml? (without having to launch a mini-fabric network in the process)?
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 11:38:10 GMT):<br/>
I don't know, but all it does is output something similar to the examples in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/tree/master/test/fixtures/config
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 11:44:41 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 11:45:23 GMT):<br/>
@davidkel - the BCCSP is also said to be optional, yet if I mark it with an `x-`, it breaks it.
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 11:47:17 GMT):<br/>
bccsp should be optional, my point about the `x-` was that if the go-sdk wanted to add optional extras to the connection profile, they should have been marked with `x-` but they didn't. I think bccsp is part of the specification and was specified as optional
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 11:47:17 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSargent</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 11:50:56 GMT):<br/>
ah, I see what you mean. I took it that the `x-` prefix only meant to things that aren't at all part of the connection profile and not related to any fabric config... i.e. just another way of passing some extra config variables in, like an app version or something, like: https://github.com/americanexpress/fabric-integration/blob/master/src/test/config/connection-profile-without-ca.json

But I guess you're saying that cryptoconfig isn't part of the official 'spec' - though I'm not actually sure where to find an official spec :-)
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 11:56:19 GMT):<br/>
It's buried in a jira somewhere but even that spec is now out of date. It wasn't updated for when features like discovery were introducefd

<p><strong>dileban</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 11:57:44 GMT):<br/>
A slightly different question while I have your attention. Do you think the Go SDK follows idiomatic Go or attempts to follow idomatic TypeScript?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 12:00:38 GMT):<br/>
Go is a very different thing to typescript  so I think it would be hard for any Go code to follow idomatic typescript
</p>
<p><strong>dileban</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 12:01:23 GMT):<br/>
I do agree, but I didn't get that impression reading through the Go SDK
</p>
<p><strong>dileban</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 12:01:41 GMT):<br/>
It felt like there was an excessive use of function pointers
</p>
<p><strong>dileban</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 12:02:03 GMT):<br/>
Many that are deeply nested
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 12:02:33 GMT):<br/>
Function pointers were a `C` concept long before anonymous functions in javascript
</p>
<p><strong>dileban</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 12:03:59 GMT):<br/>
Also agree :) ... but, I does feel like an overuse when more simpler object composition would have worked
</p>

<p><strong>dileban</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 12:04:22 GMT):<br/>
I say this having not contributed to the SDK, so it might just be a personal take on my short read through
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 12:05:09 GMT):<br/>
I think I know what you are referring too, I don't know why that particular pattern was used. A good idea at the time ?
</p>
<p><strong>dileban</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 12:06:17 GMT):<br/>
Or maybe the original developers wrote a lot of TypeScript and also contributed to the Node SDK
</p>
<p><strong>dileban</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 12:06:36 GMT):<br/>
It did mimic the Node SDK a lot
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 12:07:34 GMT):<br/>
The GO SDK maintainers didn't have any involvement in the node sdk and I doubt very much that they tried to minic to node sdk
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 12:08:04 GMT):<br/>
or javascript/typescript
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 12:26:37 GMT):<br/>
@dileban Any reason why you are choosing to use the Go SDK vs Node SDK ? 
</p>
<p><strong>dileban</strong> (Fri, 21 Feb 2020 06:16:30 GMT):<br/>
@davidkel Currently working on a relayer to shuffle messages across different DLT platforms so they could interoperate. Currently includes Fabric, Corda, Quorum/Besu but hope to extended this to a few public networks (where it makes sense). 

The relayer is currently written in Go.

Is running everything on 2.0 containers using 1.4 capabilities a good idea? I'll just use externalbuilder

*[DOUBT - Get started with GO-SDK]*

Hi guys, I hope everybody is ok. I`m newbie on the hyperledger field and I want to build a server side using GO-SDK. Could you guys provide some information about how I can get started?

Thanks in advance :smile:

hello @GuilhermeLionzo There isn't any proper documentation available but you can refer to some examples. 
You can go through @DeeptimanPattnaik multiorgledger for end-to-end example

Could somebody help me pls with system chaincode persistence? I'm using 2.0 and plugins feature is disabled. I cloned fabric, added my scc to pkg/core/scc/mycc and registered it in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/internal/peer/node/start.go#L730. I see peer accepted it and deployed. When I try to call it using sdk I get `returned error: lscc's state for [mycc] not found`. I tried to debug it until proposal is sent, I see that it invokes mycc, so I don't think it's sdk's problem 
Also, I fount this issue, maybe this is related somehow, but there are a lot of changes from 1.0 to 2.0 https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5671

<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 16:26:59 GMT):<br/>
Hi @kopaygorodsky @yacovm, 
So there's no way we could use features like discovery service or private data in a system chaincode. 
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 16:27:12 GMT):<br/>
Even i wanted to leverage that in my project. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 17:07:25 GMT):<br/>
why do you need it to be a system chaincode @Rajatsharma ?
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 17:09:27 GMT):<br/>
The thing is a system chaincode is automatically instantiated and deployed on every channel. And it will save a bit of time too. We had used this in our project's logic. 
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 17:09:47 GMT):<br/>
That's why we were using a system chaincode.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 17:11:31 GMT):<br/>
save a bit of time? are you in a hurry?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 17:11:56 GMT):<br/>
the fact that you don't instantiate it, means that you don't set an endorsement policy in the world state
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 17:12:11 GMT):<br/>
so there is no way to ensure the same endorsement policy among all peers
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 17:12:29 GMT):<br/>
We wanted to save time as much time as possible in every transaction. This was important for the client we were dealing. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 17:13:18 GMT):<br/>
but you instantiate a chaincode exactly one :O 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 17:13:18 GMT):<br/>
but you instantiate a chaincode exactly once :thinking_face: 
</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 17:13:19 GMT):<br/>
Intially when we had started the project in fabric 1.4. We had read a system chaincode does not follow the full transaction lifecycle as a normal chaincode.

<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 20:31:13 GMT):<br/>
But in every transaction too, there's a difference between the time it takes. Moreover we wanted to use the feature that whenever any channel is made system chaincode is deployed and instantiated on that channel on its own. But now we're facing difficulties due to that  
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Mon, 02 Mar 2020 20:33:00 GMT):<br/>
How much time ? Only policies are checked

</p>
<p><strong>Rajatsharma</strong> (Tue, 03 Mar 2020 07:37:27 GMT):<br/>
The main part we've used for designing the solution was that system chaincode were automatically deployed and instantiated. So we're logically forming channels and using that. I was not part of the designing phase intially, Do you think there's some problem with this ?

I would be glad if somebody from fabric maintainers responded to my question under this issue
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-15708
@yacovm could you take a quick look whenever you have time, please? I checked fabric source code, but haven't found a clue yet about it. 
It's about BootstrapMethod None in orderers 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 17:37:33 GMT):<br/>
@kopaygorodsky it's a placeholder for future work that removes the system channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 17:37:33 GMT):<br/>
@kopaygorodsky it's a placeholder for future work that adds support to bootstrap an orderer without a system channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 17:38:18 GMT):<br/>
In the future you should be able to create a genesis block of an application channel and then give it to an orderer node and it will start servicing this channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 10 Mar 2020 17:38:39 GMT):<br/>
Currently, channel creation is done by sending a transaction to the system channel and then it creates a new application channel
</p>

Hi, can someone clarify the difference between "createIdentity" and "Register" in the msp package? In both cases, seems that an enrollment token is returned, so I assume in both cases, the identity is registered in the CA. What is the difference?
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 14:19:51 GMT):<br/>
it uses different endpoints + as I see in the code Register takes default registrar credentials  while Create identity does not
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 14:19:51 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 14:27:12 GMT):<br/>
thanks. I am using register and works but I am wondering the purpose of "Create Identity". It claims to also register a user in CA, and to my understanding this should mean it needs to do it as registrar... so I am wondering what is that I am missing

@metadata you should receive a list of response , in your case one should fail and one should succeed. Since your purpose is to read, normally you do not need to send request to multiple peers unless you worried about inconsistency in the case of a peer has not catching up with the latest block.

@kopaygorodsky @tongli The policy that I'm using is `OR(Org1.member,Org2.member)` but still it is looking min. 2 endorsers. 

Using cli, It's working fine. I have stopped one of the peer and invoke/query functionalities are working fine. But if I'm invoking/querying CC using SDK with same policy with one peer down then it's not working
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Mon, 16 Mar 2020 12:33:02 GMT):<br/>
If it is working when using cli, then the policy and your network are ok. If it fails using sdk, it seems to me sdk may have issues or you may miss some flags when calling. Not really sure what the issue is.

Hi , I was trying to use `securekey/fabric-samples` to drive fabric 2.0 networks. After network was up and  executed `channel create` command by using `fabric-cli`, it told me it can't find private key in keystore. After debug in the source code, I found seems sdk is looking for private key by using `SKI_sk`, but all private keys  generated by cryptogen in fabric2.0 are stored as `priv_sk` .

I think most of the people will use cryptogen or fabric-ca to generate identities, so we should consider allow people to use private key file with different name format.

Hi, when I subscribe for chaincode events, I get the event, but the payload is null. As I see in the code, this is intended for "filtered events". Can I somehow get the payload? (e.g. by not actually filtering the events?)

Hi all, I have created a sample application to demonstrate fabric features using Go SDK beta version. It's available at https://github.com/basilky/gosdk-example. I hope this will be helpful for others.
</p>
<p><strong>metadata</strong> (Sat, 28 Mar 2020 11:16:18 GMT):<br/>
it looks great. Just few suggestions
1. remove the Org2 config from configOrg1.yaml and vice-versa.
2. also don't put everything in a single docker-compose file. create different files like docker-compose-peer0-org1.yaml 
</p>
<p><strong>basilky</strong> (Sat, 28 Mar 2020 13:13:15 GMT):<br/>
Thanks metadata.
1. Can you elaborate on which portions on the config file can be removed? I think the config file have to contain information about peers of other organizations also, to get endorsements.

2. docker-compose-e2e-template.yaml is actually generated by byfn.sh, similar to first-network in fabric-samples.

@yacovm could you, please, confirm my thoughts regarding system channel.  Is Orderer config from system channel propagated in some way to application channels? Or it's just serving a purpose to be able to reach consensus for updating system channel?

By following you answer here(https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/fabric/topic/what_is_the_difference/70075660) I suppose it's not propagated in any way to application channels.

It's big deal, but it will take a long time
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 21:27:25 GMT):<br/>
When you create a channel you specify some stuff and what you *don't* specify - is inherited from system channel
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 21:27:33 GMT):<br/>
you can override it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 21:28:41 GMT):<br/>
look at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/integration/raft/config_test.go#L791-L875
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 21:28:52 GMT):<br/>
an orderer channel is created with a subset of nodes
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 21:30:01 GMT):<br/>
So yes, it means that I can ignore Orderer part for applications channels if I'm sure that they are going to have same concenters. 
Checking your link...
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 21:30:43 GMT):<br/>
Honestly, that part of the channel config is black magic to me... I try to avoid the channel config as much as possible
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 21:31:10 GMT):<br/>
if it's not clear how to do it, you can either look at the integration test and backward engineer it
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 21:31:25 GMT):<br/>
or ask in #fabric-orderer - ask Jason since he is probably the only one knows 
</p>

Make sure you don't make mistakes because i heard someone once made a mistake and summoned Cthulhu using a channel config update 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 21:32:42 GMT):<br/>
it was solved by tearing down the docker container where it spawned
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 21:36:31 GMT):<br/>
hahahah, I don't have any docker scripts, I'm using SDK.  Everything is pretty structured, I pulled out of fabric configtx, created a lib  and now I easily manage config in any way. I just need to know what to do with that config, how to configure it properly, so yes "backward engineering" is everything I have. I'll try to ask this question in orderer group, just never seen it. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 21:37:19 GMT):<br/>
you might wanna take a look at the new library people are writing in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/pkg/config
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 21:37:45 GMT):<br/>
it is in Go, and it changes the channel config with Go APIs instead of the current JSON manipulation

I just do not understand why it can't be separated component, in that way go sdk could use it instead of copy pasting.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 21:53:33 GMT):<br/>
what can be separate ?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 21:54:03 GMT):<br/>
i think they will move it to `fabric-common` repo when they're done
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 21:54:18 GMT):<br/>
but it's easier to copy code in the same repo ;) 
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Thu, 09 Apr 2020 21:55:02 GMT):<br/>
yes, and when it's go sdk they need to  do /internal/copypastedfabric/configtx  , for example
</p>

remark to discussion about https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pull/68

Hi community! Please explain me why does the channel.Client size increases (as we can see in profiler) in direct proportion to the number of private keys in the store? Does channel.Client references to some cache? I can't find it in code

 Hi, does anyone know how to set the anchor peers on a channel using sdk go? I can create a channel using the channel.tx file but I can't see any option to update the anchor peers. I have the Org1MSPanchors.tx files but it doesn't look like sdk go uses them
</p>

Generally this means the certificates you presented weren't valid. Make sure you have the correct client certs, and that they have either a valid CN or the endpoint you are trying to connect to (127.0.0.1) is included in the SANS section of the certs

</p>

LSCC stands for `Lifecycle System Chaincode` .  new LSCC means fabric v2.1 support in sdk-go.

Does the fabsdk client enforce that there be an `https` endpoint for a Fabric CA. For testing purposes I really don't want to deal with TLS enabled CA's
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 09 Jun 2020 02:04:03 GMT):<br/>
There doesn't seem to be a way to prevent having to provide the `tlsCACerts` field in the CA portion of the config file

@BrettLogan unfortunately there doesn't seems to be a way to avoid `TLSCACerts` in identity config

try using some random pem in config to get around it. https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/core/config/testdata/template/config.yaml#L386
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 09 Jun 2020 20:56:11 GMT):<br/>

@BrettLogan Hi bret, in npm `fabric-ca-client` i remember we could skip config `tlsCACerts`. meanwhile it required ca-server side configuring TLS disabled.
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 10:06:12 GMT):<br/>
@davidkhala Unfortunately there was (is ?) an issue with the go sdk in the fact that it didn't support communicating with a CA using http only.

I need to do pagination for my GetPrivateDataByPartialCompositeKey API
1. Pagination is available for non private version of same API, is there a reason why it is not implemented for private
2. I tried solving this problem via GetPrivateDataByRange and writing a cursor based pagination myself, but it does not scan in composite key range, 

Please help here

Hi, Me and my team are trying to use fabric-sdk-go for a PoC for my company. Just struggling to understand how to handle error messages generated in the chaincode. We're using shim.Error() whenever an error occurs in the chaincode, but when we try to retrieve the error using the SDK, the response (including payload) is empty. This makes it really hard to isolate the error message as err is combined with a bunch of other info. Are we missing something here or is this simply because it's still in beta?

@troyronda Thanks for the reply. Our problem is that we want to return an error code (ie. >= 400) and we want to be able to access the error message returned in that message.
Is there a particular reason why status codes >= 400 aren't returned?

As I recall this isn’t a limitation of the SDK but rather a peer behaviour. (It has been awhile for me since I last heard about this topic though.)

Hi, I override the config following the examples given in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/e2e/configless/end_to_end_test.go
But I see the error message below:
2020/06/26 09:54:13 Failed to create new SDK: Error in option passed to New: option []interface {}{(*utils.exampleIsSecurityEnabled)(0x14af120), (*utils.exampleSecurityAlgorithm)(0x14af120), (*utils.exampleSecurityLevel)(0x14af120), (*utils.exampleSecurityProvider)(0x14af120), (*utils.exampleSoftVerify)(0x14af120), (*utils.exampleSecurityProviderLibPath)(0x14af120), (*utils.exampleSecurityProviderPin)(0x14af120), (*utils.exampleSecurityProviderLabel)(0x14af120), (*utils.exampleKeyStorePath)(0x14af120)} is not a sub interface of CryptoSuiteConfig, at least one of its functions must be implemented.
exit status 1

Here is my code:
        sdk, err := fabsdk.New(nil,
                        fabsdk.WithCryptoSuiteConfig(utils.CryptoConfigImpls),
                        fabsdk.WithEndpointConfig(utils.EndpointConfigImpls),
                        fabsdk.WithIdentityConfig(utils.IdentityConfigImpls))

Am I missing anything?

No problem, thanks. From the reading I've done, this part of Fabric has been changed a couple of times, but I felt like this wasn't the best place to discuss this in detail, so I opened a JIRA issue. I'd really appreciate it if you could take a look when you have the time.

So now I think that my problem is in the connection-ccp.yaml file. Can someone hint me to what exactly I am missing?

Oookey, update: I managed to use the fabcar gateway implementation in the fabric-samples repository with version 2.1.1. 
The complete solution to use "go" gateway implementation is to:
1. Add entityMatchers for peers:
```
entityMatchers:
  peer:
    - pattern: peer0.org1.example.com:7051
      urlSubstitutionExp: localhost:7051
      sslTargetOverrideUrlSubstitutionExp: peer0.org1.example.com
      mappedHost: peer0.org1.example.com


    - pattern: peer0.org2.example.com:9051
      urlSubstitutionExp: localhost:9051
      sslTargetOverrideUrlSubstitutionExp: peer0.org2.example.com
      mappedHost: peer0.org2.example.com
```
2. Add --csr.hosts 127.0.0.1 on orderer.example.com enrollment (My setup uses Fabric-CA)

I hope this information will help someone one day.

Oookey, update: I managed to use the fabcar gateway implementation in the fabric-samples repository with version 2.1.1. 
1. Add entityMatchers for peers in connection-cpp.(yaml/json):
```
entityMatchers:
  peer:
    - pattern: peer0.org1.example.com:7051
      urlSubstitutionExp: localhost:7051
      sslTargetOverrideUrlSubstitutionExp: peer0.org1.example.com
      mappedHost: peer0.org1.example.com


    - pattern: peer0.org2.example.com:9051
      urlSubstitutionExp: localhost:9051
      sslTargetOverrideUrlSubstitutionExp: peer0.org2.example.com
      mappedHost: peer0.org2.example.com

Did your `/etc/hosts` have an entry matching `localhost` to `127.0.0.1` seems you were just missing the default dns mapping in `/etc/hosts

<p><strong>metadata</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 10:05:57 GMT):<br/>
@kopaygorodsky Do you have any idea about implicit private collection in v2.x? Like In case of `private data`, we can set `blockToLive` in collection defination like below
```
{
    "name": "collectionMarbles",
    "policy": "OR('Org1MSP.member', 'Org2MSP.member')",
    "requiredPeerCount": 0,
    "maxPeerCount": 3,
    "blockToLive":1000000,
    "memberOnlyRead": true,
    "memberOnlyWrite": true
 }
```

But In case of implicit-private data, Is it possible to set the value of `blockToLive`? If yes then how to set it?

Kafka and solo are deprecated in both the 1.4 and 2.x streams. Raft is the ordering service we use today

What is it you are looking to do with the SDK. The programming models don't have anything to do with the underlying orderer implementation, that's blind to the application developers

I want to verify if my understanding is correct about the limitations of go sdk with Fabric 2.x. The only thing that is not supported yet is the new lifecycle right? I guess when the SDK is ready, the old lifecycle will be deprecated and we will transition since all sdks will support it.

"/etc/test-network/crypto-config/peerOrganizations/test.com/users/Admin@test.com/msp/keystore/849a1610c109206b8b7b04871dd6a1e69dfa9a9f1073f56081565cbd653bebae_sk"``` ```

When instead it should find  "priv_sk"```  This could be a bug? Someone can report it?```
Thanks for your help

Hello! I am having an issue with querying private data from ledger.
I have a setup with 2 organization and some collections are available only for one org, so in order to query the private data I must target only one organization peers (in my case it is peer0.ea.., and peer1.ea ....) and i specifically do so in the fabric-go-sdk by adding WithEndorsingPeers(....), but for some reason transaction is still endorsed from other organization peer (localhost:9051 which is peer0.auditor..) and receives and error that public hash version is not available.

Hello! I found the problem with my issue (July 31, 2020) private data issue).
The problem is that *Transaction.Evaluate() cant target specific peers, as *Transaction.Submit().
*Transaction.Evaluate() does not have a if condition to add endorsing peers (hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pkg/gateway/transaction.go): 
``` 
if txn.endorsingPeers != nil {
		options = append(options, channel.WithTargetEndpoints(txn.endorsingPeers...))
	}
``` 
This may restrict query of private data as non-authorized organization peer can receive Request transaction and try to read private data from ledger.
By adding if clause to *Transaction.Evaluate() everything works as expected. Should I make a pull request to repository or some authorized person will do a commit to fix this ?

<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Wed, 05 Aug 2020 17:02:10 GMT):<br/>
1. Not sure why using a wallet would mandate the connection profile be in json format
2. gateway uses the capabilities of the existing go sdk, so if the go sdk works with fabric 2.2 then I guess it should also work with fabric 2.2
3. The gateway pattern should be similar in it's use to how node and javascript would use them. The gateway api doesn't provide any sort of operational capabilities such as channel creation, chaincode install. It is purely a business level api to make it easier to interact with chaincode transactions, so it can invoke transactions (submit/evaluate) and submit the responses to the orderer (submit)
</p>
<p><strong>metadata</strong> (Wed, 05 Aug 2020 17:56:05 GMT):<br/>
yes it's not mandatory to use `.json` with wallet. found here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/f34cc66b8c69f9b0db8d2b9fdaf513a82945459e/pkg/gateway/example_test.go#L29

Thanks @davidkel for answering third question. It's a great insight. Actually I was confuse about the term `New programming Model` that is associated with `gateway` package. I thought that it is different way of using sdk-go from the scratch like creating channel and install/invoke CC.

hello all, I have few questions regarding new lscc.
1. What's the role of `Sequence` in new lscc? 
2. Is there any relation between `ccVersion` and `sequence`?
3. Do I have to increase the `Sequence` number if I'm upgrading the chaincode by updating ccVersion ?
link: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/92e563b577756ea8b64e5b2f60305cfdbfff23af/test/integration/e2e/orgs/multiple_orgs_test.go#L827
@troyronda @andrew-coleman
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 15:25:37 GMT):<br/>
ccVersion allows you to properly version your chaincode, the sequence is used to version the configuration against that chaincode version. So you may want to do something like, update the endorsement policy of a chaincode. Previously you needed to update the version of your chaincode to submit a config update on the chaincode (even if the chaincode hadn't changed). Now you can increment the sequence to change configuration parameters rather than having to update the chaincode version. So it decouple the chaincode from the config
</p>
<p><strong>metadata</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 15:28:29 GMT):<br/>
ok. So If I made any changes to chaincode then I have to increase the ccVersion and as you mentioned in case of endorsement policies I can update the sequence. Right?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 15:28:30 GMT):<br/>
So sequence is really the `lifecycle` versioning
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 15:28:35 GMT):<br/>
Correct

createTransaction forms and returns a transaction object, it does not submit it. You can then do things like add even listeners to the transaction. You then call Submit on the transaction object. So it looks like this `transaction := contract.CreateTransaction("createCar")` and then you can do `transaction.Submit("arg1","arg2","arg3")` to actually submit the transaction. Whereas `contract.SubmitTransaction` immediately submits the transaction

Hello all, In fabric-samples while running fabcar.go I get an error "Failed to submit transaction: Failed to submit: CreateAndSendTransaction failed: SendTransaction failed: orderers is nil exit status 1" when trying to submit transactions. Tried adding orderers to the connection-org1.yaml file, and wondering if anyone else encountered this issue and found a solution. https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/master/fabcar/go/fabcar.go

Hi everyone! I have a use case where I would like to sign a fabric transaction with the users key offline and send it to the endorser.

I know this is possible with the Node SDK: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/master/docs/tutorials/sign-transaction-offline.md
but can something like this also be done using the fabric-sdk-go?
</p>
<p><strong>fasmat</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 16:31:50 GMT):<br/>
hey @root10: I'm trying to do the same thing. Have you managed to do an offline transaction with the fabric-go-sdk?
</p>
<p><strong>fasmat</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 16:33:51 GMT):<br/>
Hi @MHBauer ! I'm also trying to create a transaction offline and forward it to a node similar to how the node sdk is able to do that. Did you figure out how to achiev this with the go sdk?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 17:27:18 GMT):<br/>
AFAIK, all of them.

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Fri, 28 Aug 2020 12:16:39 GMT):<br/>

@tongli try gateway package.

</p>
<p><strong>garunkumar450</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 14:45:10 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda client, err := event.New(clientChannelContext, event.WithBlockEvents(), event.WithSeekType(seek.FromBlock), event.WithBlockNum(260))
This method returns only 260 blocks
</p>
<p><strong>garunkumar450</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 14:45:46 GMT):<br/>
but i need remaining blocks continuously  up to maximum
</p>
<p><strong>garunkumar450</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 14:46:39 GMT):<br/>
we are getting 260 block and when ever block is created it is getting triggered but we have total 500 blocks

@metadata @troyronda tried to gateway to submit transactions , the submitTransaction method wont return until the tx gets committed on the ledger, the behavior is the same in client.Execute, what could be done to simply submit without waiting for it to be committed to the ledger? For a server application, this wait will not work really well.

Put `go` in front of it to spin off a `goroutine` and make it a non-blocking call
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 01 Sep 2020 18:20:23 GMT):<br/>
You can create functions out of `goroutines` and use waitgroups to manage the size of the `goroutine` pool to limit the maximium number of goroutines executing at once as well

Hi Guys. I hope someone can point me in the correct direction.
In Particular... is there a limit on how large a history (number of entries) of a key can get? I am kind of irritated of a "magic" number (100k entries in history).. I am somehow stuck on where to look for or in what kind of limitation I am running into?
stub.GetHistoryForKey will only return 100k of entries within the iterator.. Am I doing something wrong or am I hitting any sort of limit that I am not aware of?

Hi! I'm trying to implement a stateless microservice using go-sdk version 1.0.0-beta3. Microservice gets a private key and certificate via TCP during initialization on startup. So the idea is to not use the local file system at all. It is possible to set up MSP key like this:
```
signIdentity, err := mspClient.CreateSigningIdentity(mspctx.WithPrivateKey(privateKey), mspctx.WithCert(certificate))
```
But I can't find the interface for doing the same for TLS keys. Is it possible? Maybe some workaround?

Hi guys! 

Firstly, thanks for your work on new lifecycle support. It's big deal. But I have also some questions for you :)

Tell me please, can we select separate peers to listen for blocks through the event service? *event.New()* has no such func options. I investigated SDK code and found that event service initialized when we create *FabricSDK instance with peers from channel config, and later (when we do *event.New()*) the cache is used. My case allows for a local patch, but I think this will require rewriting a significant part of SDK. 

Can you explain if I'm right or if I am missing something?

#### Title: When I used msp in fabric-sdk-go to register users with CA, an error occurred

fabric release-1.4



The error is as follows：

```
Register return error:
 failed to register user: failed to register user: Response from server: Error Code: 20 - Authentication failure
```

The relevant part of the code is as follows：

```go
import (
[...]
mspclient "github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pkg/client/msp"
[...]
)

[...]

func RegisterUser(sdk *fabsdk.FabricSDK, info *InitInfo, r *RegistrationRequest) (string, error) {
	clientContext := sdk.Context(fabsdk.WithUser(info.OrgAdmin), fabsdk.WithOrg(info.OrgName))
	if clientContext == nil {
		return "", fmt.Errorf("根据指定的组织名称与管理员创建资源管理客户端Context失败")
	}
	// 创建一个新的msp客户端实例，并返回
	c, err := mspclient.New(sdk.Context(), mspclient.WithOrg(info.OrgName))
	if err != nil {
		return "", fmt.Errorf("根据指定的 OrgName 创建 Org MSP 客户端实例失败: %v", err)
	}
	request := mspclient.RegistrationRequest{
		Name:           r.Name,
		Type:           r.Type,
		MaxEnrollments: r.MaxEnrollments,
		Affiliation:    r.Affiliation,
		//Attributes:     ,
		CAName: r.CAName,
		Secret: r.Secret,
	}
	_, err = c.Register(&request)
	if err != nil {
		return "", fmt.Errorf("Register return error:\n %s\n", err)
	}
	return "enroll user is completed", nil
}
```

In the stack overflow Forum,  I also found that someone reported the same error, and some people answered that the user name and password do not match, but my code is a registered user, this reason should not appear. 

I hope someone can tell me what went wrong. Thank you very much

Just a follow up with my issue. It had to do with the connection file for the gateway package. The peer url on connection file was "localhost:7051" and also on peer environmental variables the "CORE_PEER_ADDRESS" was peer0.example.com. So i had to add on my /etc/hosts file, the following line 127.0.0.1 peer0.example.com
</p>
<p><strong>andrew-coleman</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 08:40:45 GMT):<br/>
You can't turn it off. The Go gateway implementation always uses discovery
</p>
<p><strong>andrew-coleman</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 08:42:26 GMT):<br/>
do you have the `DISCOVERY_AS_LOCALHOST` environment variable set to `TRUE`?  That should avoid the need to change your /etc/hosts file

fabric And fabric-sdk-go are use different version of viper v0.0.0-20150908122457-1967d93db724 & v1.1.1 , and the latter is case insensitive... this can cause some issue when verifying policy

On gateway package, there is a key certificateAuthorities.httpOptions.verify. Is this used anywhere during the gateway operations?

<p><strong>andrew-coleman</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 10:38:43 GMT):<br/>
no, the gateway package only deals with submitting transactions.  It doesn't interact with the CA

in pkg "github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pkg/client/msp"，does CreateIdentity overlaps Register？the structs they use are similar，as follows：```
// RegistrationRequest defines the attributes required to register a user with the CA
type RegistrationRequest struct {
	// Name is the unique name of the identity
	Name string
	// Type of identity being registered (e.g. "peer, app, user")
	Type string
	// MaxEnrollments is the number of times the secret can  be reused to enroll.
	// if omitted, this defaults to max_enrollments configured on the server
	MaxEnrollments int
	// The identity's affiliation e.g. org1.department1
	Affiliation string
	// Optional attributes associated with this identity
	Attributes []Attribute
	// CAName is the name of the CA to connect to
	CAName string
	// Secret is an optional password.  If not specified,
	// a random secret is generated.  In both cases, the secret
	// is returned from registration.
	Secret string
}
// IdentityRequest represents the request to add/update identity to the fabric-ca-server
type IdentityRequest struct {

	// The enrollment ID which uniquely identifies an identity (required)
	ID string

	// The identity's affiliation (required)
	Affiliation string

	// Array of attributes to assign to the user
	Attributes []Attribute

	// Type of identity being registered (e.g. 'peer, app, user'). Default is 'user'.
	Type string

	// The maximum number of times the secret can be reused to enroll (default CA's Max Enrollment)
	MaxEnrollments int

	// The enrollment secret. If not provided, a random secret is generated.
	Secret string

	// Name of the CA to send the request to within the Fabric CA server (optional)
	CAName string

I try to use the new gateway package on an existing project that already uses fabric-sdk-go.  I struggle to transfer the identity of users that I created using a msp.Client with Register and Enroll and a Fabric CA.  Which receiver in pkg/client/msp  (or elsewhere) would allow to retrieve the user's cert and private key with calling parameters user ID and the enrollment secret?
The fabcar example looks for the cert and private key directly in the local folders.  I would like to have a less static solution.

You may forget about roleName as I am using ABAC roles in my chaincodes.
The tricky part that took me time to find out was to set Type as "client". 
The storeSecret is my own vault that securely stores the enrolmentSecret.   This secure vault allows to initialize the user by providing the secret in other sessions or and other computers.

right after you enrolled a user, you can get it's SigningIdentity by id, in that SingingIdentity there is SKI() which you can use to build filename and look for a key SKI()_sk in keystore. There is no way right now to encode private key from SigningIdentity.

Thanks  PrivateKey().SKI() does perfectly the job.  I can now populate automatically the wallet for any user that was enrolled with  the CA, as long as I have the enrollment secret.  I wrote a "secure" vault that stores these secrets in an encrypted form.
I am worried to have the private key of a user in the clear in a persistent "wallet".  This would be an easy target for any attacker.   _It is also true for th keys in key store. _

The file-system wallet does store its data in cleartext. You could provide your own WalletStore implementation that encrypts data going into the wallet and decrypts it on the way out, but you'll need to consider how you secure the secrets used to do this decryption
</p>
<p><strong>bestbeforetoday</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 09:35:59 GMT):<br/>
If the WalletStore approach is not convenient for you then you have the option of managing the credential storage yourself and then inserting them into an in-memory wallet at the point you connect the Gateway to avoid having a wallet persist your credentials

@negupta that has hopefully been fixed by this PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pull/150

@andrew-coleman Thanks. Can I pick that up now, or do I need to wait for a new tag?
</p>
<p><strong>wunderbarb</strong> (Tue, 13 Oct 2020 21:08:19 GMT):<br/>
Thanks.  The second option seems to be a variant of the first, excepted that it can use any "proprietary" format for the persistent storage and "feed" the decrypted data in the Wallet format for in memory.
In both cases, the encryption/decryption key needs protection.  I foresee to use a passphrase that is then KDFed as this key.  The passphrase may then be either user-provided, or even provided by a Yubikey-like solution.
Is there any plan by the fabric-sdk-go team to offer such securization?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=fmWyBk7oGvfdjjAas) I'm new to the Hyperledger "Greenhouse" too, but ... if I'm not mistaken the Fabric Peers have the means to process Go Chaincodes. You don't need tore configure the network. That's a architectural redesign that's not gonna fix your problem. You should just use the Go SDK to submit transactions. Or just submit Go code via the peer binary. Check out this quote:
```
The SDK serves as a shim to package the transaction proposal into the properly architected format (protocol buffer over gRPC) and takes the user’s cryptographic credentials to produce a unique signature for this transaction proposal.

Hello! 
I have almost the same problem as negupta, but with minor caviat. I have whole ledger network on one instance (orderers, peers, CAs) and trying to submit transaction from other instance (client application), but unfortunately receive same resposne: 
```
Failed to submit: CreateAndSendTransaction failed: SendTransaction failed: calling orderer '127.0.0.1:7050' failed: Orderer Client Status Code: (2) CONNECTION_FAILED. Description: dialing connection on target [127.0.0.1:7050]: connection is in TRANSIENT_FAILURE
```  
I assume that the problem is that my client is trying to send transaction to localhost (maybe) and I need to specify orderer(s) url in ccp.yaml (connection profile) does my theory makes any sense or it's a different issue. 
This is with latest commit on "hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go@master".
PS: EvaluateTransaction works as expected and I am able to receive data from peers.
</p>
<p><strong>sergeikus</strong> (Fri, 16 Oct 2020 07:43:21 GMT):<br/>
Oke, so I noticed that even if I provide orderers to `entityMatchers:` url  is still ignored and defaults to 127.0.0.1, and looks like only solution for now (and for me) is to use `channels:` field with specified orderers.
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 04:12:52 GMT):<br/>
Is this with the high level gateway model? Or the low level SDK? If the former, have you set `export DISCOVERY_AS_LOCALHOST=false`
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 04:13:06 GMT):<br/>
On the system, or done it in code `err := os.Setenv("DISCOVERY_AS_LOCALHOST", "false")`
</p>
<p><strong>sergeikus</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 11:30:52 GMT):<br/>
This is with high level gateway, and no, I have not set `export DISCOVERY_AS_LOCALHOST=false`, but looks like this would solve my problem.

A query does not require the orderer, so it appears that you are able to connect to the peer. If the network does *not* use discovery, then the orderer may be incorrect or missing in the connection profile, if using discovery there might be an issue in the anchor peer

Are you using a "gateway" connection?

<p><strong>andrew-coleman</strong> (Mon, 09 Nov 2020 15:00:38 GMT):<br/>
Are you using the gateway package to submit the transaction?  If so, there has been a recent bug fix and you need to pick up the latest commit from master branch

Migrating a gateway test from local-docker network to a cloud-based docker network.  When calling a query with traditional SDK interface (typical connection.yaml), it works.  The same query via the gateway (connection-org1.yaml) fails with the message `Endorser Client Status Code: (2) CONNECTION_FAILED. Description: dialing connection on target [peer0.org1.example.com:7051]: connection is in TRANSIENT_FAILURE`
I use the same parameters for the peer0 and CA in both SDK connection file and gateway connection file.   In the gateway configuration, the DISCOVERY_AS_LOCALHOST is false.
The description of peer0 and ca in connection.yaml is
`peers:
  peer0.org1.example.com:
    # this URL is used to send endorsement and query requests
    # url: grpcs://peer0.org1.example.com:7051

Migrating a gateway test from local-docker network to a cloud-based docker network.  When calling a query with traditional SDK interface (typical connection.yaml), it works.  The same query via the gateway (connection-org1.yaml) fails with the message `Endorser Client Status Code: (2) CONNECTION_FAILED.

This has been fixed recently, but is not yet in the latest tagged release. Use `go get github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go@9c426dc`

node sdk will load connection profile with embedded certs specified in pem. But go sdk does not seem to support that. Can any one confirm if that is the case?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew-coleman</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 09:42:08 GMT):<br/>
It does.  Take a look at the fabcar sample in go https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/master/fabcar/go
That uses the same ccp as the node and Java samples with embedded certs

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 12:14:57 GMT):<br/>
@andrew-coleman will take a look. Thanks

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 17:02:37 GMT):<br/>
@andrew-coleman thanks for the pointer. The issue was that the ca certs were not an array in other format, that was the cause of the error. Once it was changed to array, things started working.

Andrew, I tried with this version.  I still have the issue.  If I perform the same query using the "usual" query transaction and it works.  When using the gateway's `EvaluateTransaction` for the same contract and same remote network, it fails.  If it may help, the corresponding test trace.```

Hi all, now that the Node SDK does not maintain features for administrating a network, I'm looking for alternatives. The Go SDK seems to have everything I need, especially when combined with the fabric-config packages. But it's in beta. So I have 2 questions: 1. when is the SDK scheduled for GA? 2. Are the admin features (create and join channels, update config tx) planned to stay and continue to be updated?

Hi,  I still struggle with using the gateway API with a remote server.   
I ahve implemented the same invoke and query with the gateway SDK and the traditional SDK.  When working with a local blockchain, they all work. When using the "traditional" API, both invoke and query work with the remote server.  But the gateway invoke (SubmitTRansaction) and query (EvaluateTransaction) fail.

Is `peer0.org1.example.com` the address of your remote peer? Is there anything relevant in the peer logs?  Can you share your client code?

The blockchain is running on an AWS instance.  The address of peer0.org1.example.com is an actual raw IP address (_I know it is bad, but for dev it is convenient_).  Thus, the config file holds the IP address as

For the Query, it claims that the peer is in TRANSIENT_FAILURE.
For the source code of the client, it is part of a larger pkg that wraps both the traditional SDK (with admin) and gateway SDK with my own configuration handling.  I will extract the minimal set to make it is easier to examine as I guess that you may need the gateway client establishment code also.   If complexity is not an issue, I can give access to the full pkg source.
Thanks for the help.

Hello all
I am finding difficulties to understand how to implement the sdk-go.
Trying to read the documentation was a little complicated for me.
Do we have anything alike a tutorial, walkthrough, explaining how functions behave?

Hi everyone. Currently, I'm working with Fabric SDK Go. I have some questions:
1. To work together with SDK we need a configuration file and I feel so concerned how we can generate the config file, I couldn't find documents anywhere.
2. I planned to save channel information to database. So that, Is it possible to use Fabric SDK Go without config file ?
Can anyone help me? Thank you

Hello all. Does anybody know how to invoke system chaincodes with gateway?
</p>
<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Fri, 08 Jan 2021 12:09:35 GMT):<br/>
Yes. You can configure sdk with different providers, check opts in New function.

Dear all and Andrew, I've used the fabric-sdk-go to contact and send transactions in the context of a benchmark application. It looks like I am suffering of the same issue of wunderbarb. I am using v1.0.0-rc1, the gateway API works very well in a localhost environment but it stops working when going remote.

The network layout is 4 peers in 2 different orgs in 4 different machines on an OpenStack infrastructure. The network is functional by itself and can do an entire transaction lifecycle if I use the CLI.

The client code in summary :

the gateway is instantiated : ` f.Gateway, err = gateway.Connect(
		gateway.WithConfig(config.FromFile(filepath.Clean(ccpPath))),
		gateway.WithIdentity(wallet, user.Label)) `
		
The wallet has the identity of User1 of org1.example.com.


Transactions are sent like this : ` _, err := f.Contract.SubmitTransaction(transaction.FunctionName, transaction.Args...) `


The connection-profile used by the gateway in the client code is :

` name: test-network-org1
version: 1.0.0
client:
  organization: Org1
  connection:
    timeout:
      peer:
        endorser: '300'
organizations:
  Org1:
    mspid: Org1MSP
    peers:
    - peer0.org1.example.com
    - peer1.org1.example.com
peers:
  peer0.org1.example.com:
    url: grpcs://${HOST1_IP}:7051
    tlsCACerts:
      pem: <certificate>
    grpcOptions:
      ssl-target-name-override: peer0.org1.example.com
      hostnameOverride: peer0.org1.example.com
      request-timeout: 120001

  peer1.org1.example.com:
    url: grpcs://${HOST2_IP}:8051
    tlsCACerts:
      pem: <certificate>
    grpcOptions:
      ssl-target-name-override: peer1.org1.example.com
      hostnameOverride: peer1.org1.example.com
      request-timeout: 120001 `


The error message when submitting transactions is : 

` "error": "Failed to submit: Multiple errors occurred: - Transaction processing for endorser [peer0.org1.example.com:7051]: Endorser Client Status Code: (2) CONNECTION_FAILED. Description: dialing connection on target [peer0.org1.example.com:7051]: connection is in TRANSIENT_FAILURE - Transaction processing for endorser [peer1.org2.example.com:10051]: Endorser Client Status Code: (2) CONNECTION_FAILED.

The logs on peer0.org1.example indicate that the peer discovery service is functional and can exchange with the SDK since the SDK has discovered org2 peers not listed in the connection-profile. The logs when submitTransaction() is called are :

`2021-01-09 11:56:57.396 UTC [comm.grpc.server] 1 -> INFO 113 unary call completed grpc.service=discovery.Discovery grpc.method=Discover grpc.request_deadline=2021-01-09T11:57:12.391Z grpc.pe

er_address=192.168.1.205:45124 grpc.code=OK grpc.call_duration=3.405435ms` 

The discover addresses are my two hosts using my client code. The problem remains even with a single host. The logs don't go further, the peer doesn't indicate any error concerning a TRANSIENT_FAILURE or CONNECTION_FAILED.

I know this is a fairly long post but I think this issue might be a major obstacle towards commercial use of the SDK-go. Please tell me if you need any more details or If I can contribute in any help.

Thank you for reading

To make this work locally, you would have set the env-var DISCOVERY_AS_LOCALHOST to TRUE.  Did you set it to false (or unset it) for the remote case?

Dear Andew, thank you for your response. I did set it to false. I think the peer logs indicating correct usage of the discovery service confirm that if I'm not mistaken

Hey guys, I'm using fabric-sdk-go in kubernetes. 
- I use an in-memory wallet for the MSP credentials
- I mount the TLS credentials in /var/hyperledger, then I refer to them in the config like so:
```
    client:
      tlsCerts:
        systemCertPool: false
        client:
          key:
            path: /var/hyperledger/tls/client/pair/tls.key
          cert:
            path: /var/hyperledger/tls/client/pair/tls.crt
        server:
          key:
            path: /var/hyperledger/tls/server/pair/tls.key
          cert:
            path: /var/hyperledger/tls/server/pair/tls.crt
```
When calling `gateway.Connect()` I'm getting the following error

```
Failed to apply config option: failed to initialize configuration: unable to initialize cryptosuite using crypto suite config: failed to initialize crypto suite: Could not initialize BCCSP SW: Failed to initialize software key store: mkdir keystore: permission denied  
```

Why is the SDK trying to create a keystore directory, and how can I either prevent it or point it to a folder it has write permissions to?
</p>
<p><strong>AurelienGasser1</strong> (Thu, 14 Jan 2021 21:39:39 GMT):<br/>
I found the solution. I had to specify in the config:

```
client:
  credentialStore:
    cryptoStore:
      path: /tmp
```

```
The remote blockchain works perfectly with non-gateway calls.  The `DISCOVERY_AS_LOCALHOST` is false.
The code is available at https:// github.com/wunderbarb/fabric.  It holds all the credentials to connect to the remote blockchain which is running permanently.
THanks in advance for your help.

"If you followed the instructions above and set use_couchdb to true" sounds pretty vague to me and is one big assumption from here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/master/off_chain_data/README.md, is this an issue?

How to embedded list of users in config file?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew-coleman</strong> (Tue, 19 Jan 2021 09:49:49 GMT):<br/>
@wunderbarb @HarryEPFL  In your network-config yaml, you have the grpc option 
`ssl-target-name-override: peer0.org1.example.com`.
Does that match the actual hostname of your remote server?  If not, then you'll get TLS errors (seen in the peer logs) which might explain the TRANSIENT_FAILURE
</p>
<p><strong>wunderbarb</strong> (Tue, 19 Jan 2021 19:21:48 GMT):<br/>
@andrew-coleman The peer0.org1.example.com certificate has `CN=peer0` but `SAN DNS=peer0.org1.example.com`.  I had a look in the peer logs, and no TLS issue.  BTW, if you replace with `ssl-target-name-override: peer0`, then SDK fails.  This seems normal in go 1.15 has the SAN is the important factor rather than CN.
Interestingly, when examining the logs after the test `go test -v -run Test_Remote_Client_Query`, it displays `INFO 13b finished chaincode: cscc duration: 0ms channel=mychannel txID=fc7ca7ab`.  When launching again, you get a similar record but with a different transaction ID.   It may seem that the transaction occurred, but something failed downstream.
Similar log output for `go test -v -run Test_Remote_Client_Query`

@troyronda @bstasyszyn hey guys, I have a question regarding CryptoSuite. It's available to a user, but no methods can be called because all the available opts are internal.
If I implement Opts interface it's getting rejected because in KeyGen and all other methods there are verifications against strict list of internal types using reflection.
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/internal/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/bccsp/sw/impl.go#L81
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/common/providers/core/cryptosuite.go#L113

Are there any existing plans regarding this issue? Is it ok if I implement constructors for all of those options and make them available to a user?

Hi community! 
I created an a bccsp/sdk patch for using Vault as storage for users' keys. Vault can be used just as storage, not cryptoprovider (BCCSP is still doing this). Backward compatibility doesn't break, it's _very easy_ to use. Does it make sense to send a pull request to fabric-go-sdk or is it obviously not needed in SDK?

At https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go, there are several packages and in a separated section pkg/gateway... Which is used in fabric-samples. I don't understand, it is an alternative or the way to go?

2.update channel config adding org2 
3.serialize config update and sign with org1
4.send tx to the orderer
But i received an error "signature for identity 0 is invalid: The signature is invalid" "error applying config update to existing channel 'ccc': error authorizing update: error validating DeltaSet: policy for [Group]  /Channel/Application not satisfied: implicit policy evaluation failed - 0 sub-policies were satisfied, but this policy requires 1 of the 'Admins' sub-policies to be satisfied"

<p><strong>nikolas</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 08:55:29 GMT):<br/>
Issue was apparently the following: the client was trying to subscribe, but if the connection would fail, it would not try again. the sdk client was not retrying to connect. To my understanding, it only tries to reconnect as long as the initial connection was successful. Currently I implemented an own retry on error mechanism for the initial connection. If you have a hint on making the connection to retry to connect via sdk config, please let me know.

now, I am writing a server for invoke/query chaincode(I just have one channel), if I have to new a channel(function:channel.New()) for every request? or I can new a channel once and use it
my server maybe get some request concurrent，I want to know if the channel.Request.Execute() is thread-safe? so I don't need to new a channel for every request and reuse the channel client

I have deployed my hyperledger fabric network and my client application (using fabric-sdk-go) in a single machine (with docker compose) and all have worked fine, but i'm trying to deploy my network with containers on different hosts (using a overlay network with docker swarm). This step has worked, but my client app isn't working because it can't communicate with containers on a different host. I think that the problem is related to entity matchers section on my config.yaml file. For my original solution (single host) entity matchers is set like this:

entityMatchers:
  peer:
    - pattern: (\w*)peer0.org1.app.com(\w*)
      urlSubstitutionExp: localhost:7051
      eventUrlSubstitutionExp: localhost:7053
      sslTargetOverrideUrlSubstitutionExp: peer0.org1.app.com
      mappedHost: peer0.org1.app.com

    - pattern: (\w*)peer1.org1.app.com(\w*)
      urlSubstitutionExp: localhost:8051
      eventUrlSubstitutionExp: localhost:8053
      sslTargetOverrideUrlSubstitutionExp: peer1.org1.app.com
      mappedHost: peer1.org1.app.com

  orderer:
    - pattern: (\w*)orderer.app.com(\w*)
      urlSubstitutionExp: grpc://localhost:7050
      sslTargetOverrideUrlSubstitutionExp: orderer.app.com
      mappedHost: orderer.app.com

  certificateAuthorities:
    - pattern: (\w*)ca.org1.app.com(\w*)
      urlSubstitutionExp: http://localhost:7054
      mappedHost: ca.org1.app.com
For my solution on multiple hosts i've ca and orderer on a host and peer0 and peer 1 on other host. My question is: How can i substitute localhost for the url of the corresponding container on a different host? (if the problem is really that)

note: i've tried to change localhost for the name of the docker container, but it didn't work

Hey guys, I intend to make a PR to this problem but idk how is the best way to do this as the reenroll uses the same old private key already revoked. Calling only enroll over a revoked identity will throw that the operation is not allowed as the identity has been revoked

rn I'm removing identity from CA before enrolling it again, which is not the best practice :(

HI guys, question: is there a way to decode the peer.ProcessedTransaction returned by the ledger client into readable data? if I marshal into json, I get base64 envelop that contains a lot of artifacts

Hi! Why `client.LifecycleQueryCommittedCC()` returns LifecycleChaincodeDefinition slice, where items have all fields filled except of  `SignaturePolicy` field, which is always nil?

Hi all, I want to migrate my applications from Node.js to Go, I have some event services with checkpointers keeping track of the latest processed block and I am not finding this functionality in the Go SDK. Does it exist or should I take care of keeping track myself in the event handlers?
Thanks in advance.

Ок, look at this too: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pkg/client/event#ClientOption

You can specify "give only new blocks". This is closest to what you want.
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Tue, 23 Mar 2021 18:20:03 GMT):<br/>
but give only new blocks is that it just processes the new blocks that come in from the moment the listener is running I assume, it are not unprocessed blocks that came in during down-time I guess?
</p>
<p><strong>braduf</strong> (Tue, 23 Mar 2021 18:23:09 GMT):<br/>
and so the answer is that with the Go SDK you should keep track of the last processed block in some persistent storage from withing the event handler one implements itself, right?

Hi all, are there any examples available that use an HSM with the Go SDK and without Fabric CA, please? So the keys will be created in the HSM and certs will also already exist.

I know a workaround that might work for you, you can specifiy the implicit private data collection of the orgs you want endorsement from. And normally only peers of those orgs will be selected.

Hi!
Do you know if exist an "HsmX509Provider" and "HsmX509Identity" in the GO SDK, i found that classes in NodeJS SDK.
Or better... do you know how to populate a wallet in GO SDK using an HSM to store the private key?

Hi, I have set up my fabric network with 3 orderers in one organization and a consortium with 5 organizaitons successfully. Each organization has only one peer node and join in the same channel. And I have installed and instantiated two chaincodes in this channel. However, when I invoke chaincode by `*channel.Client`, sometimes it work correctly, and sometimes I get such an error:

</p>
<p><strong>PanzvorHong</strong> (Mon, 12 Apr 2021 03:58:08 GMT):<br/>
I have found the reason for this problem. That's because endorsers got from channel should be contained in the peers list which got by `discovery`, or it will be filtered. 
And there has always been only one endorser peer got from channel or `discovery`. So, unless the two are equal, the endorsement is not satisfied. The relevant source code in `fabric-sdk-go` is as follows.
fabricselection.go
```go
func (s *Service) getEndorsers(chaincodes []*fab.ChaincodeCall, chResponse discclient.ChannelResponse, peerFilter soptions.PeerFilter, sorter soptions.PeerSorter) (discclient.Endorsers, error) {
	peers, err := s.discovery.GetPeers()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, errors.Wrapf(err, "error getting peers from discovery service for channel [%s]", s.channelID)
	}
        // `chResponse.Endorsers()` will use `newFilter(s.ctx, peers, peerFilter, sorter)` to filter endorsers.
	endpoints, err := chResponse.Endorsers(asInvocationChain(chaincodes), newFilter(s.ctx, peers, peerFilter, sorter))
	if err != nil && newDiscoveryError(err).IsTransient() {
		return nil, status.New(status.DiscoveryServerStatus, int32(status.QueryEndorsers), fmt.Sprintf("error getting endorsers: %s", err), []interface{}{})
	}

	return endpoints, err
}
```

Now the question is, why can only one endorser be obtained from the channel or found by `discovery`? I tried to fix it by modifying some possible configurations in yaml, but they all failed.

<p><strong>bur</strong> (Fri, 23 Apr 2021 13:06:09 GMT):<br/>
you specify the endorsing peers using a option on `contract.CreateTransaction`. For instance:
```
	txn, err := c.contract.CreateTransaction(
		"__invoke",
		gateway.WithEndorsingPeers(peers...),
	)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	logger.Debugf("calling __invoke!")
	return txn.Evaluate(args...)
```

But with this code I also had the issue that this requires the peers you are specifying here must be part of your connections profil. :/

Hi all !!!
I am using fabric SDK go v1.0.0
For enrolling user from fabric ca I'm using 
Enroll method of client/msp pkg

This method is not returning identity after calling Enroll function.(like it is returning in nodejs SDK) It is directly storing it in crypto store. 

Is there any way in SDK we can get the identity of enrolled user and return it to the user in response of rest API
</p>
<p><strong>andrew-coleman</strong> (Mon, 26 Apr 2021 13:02:29 GMT):<br/>
The `gateway.WithEndorsingPeers()` method is a wrapper for the underlying `channel.WithTargetEndpoints()` method.  I'm not sure whether that uses the discovery results.  @troyronda?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Mon, 26 Apr 2021 13:04:18 GMT):<br/>

or in config.yaml in peers section

<p><strong>kopaygorodsky</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 15:10:25 GMT):<br/>
each peer that you got from discovery service must be contained in that list, otherwise fabricselection will ignore it.

@troyronda @bstasyszyn I think we need to fix that approach, with dynamic discovery it should be possible to define a single peer in EndpointConfi from which you can get list of all peers in the network and work with them. If you agree I could do a PR

I have investigated a little.  If I replaced log.Info (resp log.Infof) with log.Debug (resp log.Debugf) in the files `internal/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/lib/client.go` and `internal/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/util/csp.go` in `fabric-sdk-go` and `github.com/cloudflare/cfssl/csr/csr.go/Generate`, it obviously fixed the issue.

Hello everyone, im trying to use HSM with the GO SDK, my objective is to use it with a wallet, some kind of identityprovider, im creating a PR to create this interaction but i have some doubts:
- Is this the right approach for this project?
- Using Cryptosuite with PKCS11 interface is not as clear as i wanted it to be.
- Using identitymanager or using the mspwallet to create a manager is not explained thoroughly

I want to do something like this: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-node/blob/main/fabric-network/src/impl/wallet/hsmx509identity.ts i have my interfaces and some of the functions, but when i think how to link everything with a wallet, i just don't know if the path im following is correct

@troyronda  @bstasyszyn  Hello guys.  I’ve stumbled on an issue with lifecycleprocessor. When I query for commited chaincodes I get error that “responses from endorsers do not match”. The problem is in the function that validates those responses. https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/main/pkg/client/resmgmt/lifecycleprocessor.go#L540 It uses proto.Equal which fails to compare slices values that are in different order.   
Two peers return the same list of chaincodes, but in different order because a slice structure is used instead of a map. Here https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/main/core/chaincode/lifecycle/scc.go#L620.  I suppose namespaces can’t guarantee a specific order on all peers every time.

I could provide a PR in order to fix that issue if you agree

Hello, is there any way to disable logs from SDK? For example, something like `[fabsdk/core] 2021/05/31 08:46:50 UTC - cryptosuite.GetDefault -> INFO No default cryptosuite found, using default SW implementation`. My app already has its own logging system based on JSON format, and I don't want to see logs from fabric SDK, which I cannot control.

Hi, I ran into the error "TRANSIENT_FAILURE", when I tried to send a transaction using `Gateway.Submit` method. In summary, to use my custom logging system, I initialized `FabricSDK` object using `fabsdk.New()` method then injected it to my `Gateway` object using `WithSDK` option. However, the transaction submission fails and encounters TRANSIENT_FAILURE. When I'm using only `Gateway` with `WithConfig`, the submission works fine. At that time, the only problem was logging messages printed by `fabric-sdk-go`. 

So, my question is one of them: How can I disable `fabric-sdk-go`'s default logging system only using `Gateway` package, or How can I handle `TRANSIENT_FAILURE` error. The full message of this error is: `Failed to submit: error registering for TxStatus event: could not create client conn: could not connect to peer1.test.bpl:7051: dialing connection on target [peer1.test.bpl:7051]: connection is in TRANSIENT_FAILURE`.

I posted my question in detail on Stackoverflow. Please check it and help me. Thanks.

You can pass the same option to the sdk instance WithMspPkg, though I’m not sure that it’s a correct flow, looks like a bug in gateway

I make a channel with two peers (peer1-org1，peer2-org2)
then I install chaincode to peers, and set the endorsement policy to "AND ('Org1MSP.member','Org2MSP.member')"
when I invoke the chaincode, I just send to peer1, so I get a error
but when I query the blocks, I found it produce four blocks, each block have only one transaction
why????

your smartcontracts will receive a TransactionContextInterface which exposes a GetStub() method.
Once you have the underlying stub, you can call stub.GetTxTimestamp()

hey guys, as part of working on the FireFly connector for Fabric (https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly-fabconnect), using fabric-sdk-go, I came across a "limitation": the cache for the event services generates lookup keys that only takes into account the channel ID. this means if I specify different parameters such as `fromBlock` which is supposed to result in a different event stream, I could get the same event service that existed before. I started the following PR to get around this and would appreciate any input on whether this is going in the right direction or I have missed something with my understanding: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pull/184
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 06 Aug 2021 18:12:11 GMT):<br/>
are all of the containers needed for a basic kafka setup? I think the examples, ksqldb-cli and datagen are optional?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 06 Aug 2021 19:47:01 GMT):<br/>
I tried to use the docker cluster to test the kafka handler inside fabconnect, the broker container keeps crashing after processing one message with `broker exited with code 137`, googling shows that this is OOME. checking the message consumption it looks like the confluent platform requires ~8GB memory in idle state. that's pretty difficult to sustain on a developer's laptop.

do you mind looking into switching to a leaner setup, maybe `solsson/kafka` based?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Fri, 06 Aug 2021 20:29:06 GMT):<br/>
I managed to pare down the docker-compose.yaml to just the zookeeper and broker, and use the GUI tool https://kafkatool.com/download.html to manage, this seems to be going OK so far (still using the Confluent images)

Hey, I want to query the ledger for a value without creating a new transaction. Something equivalent to [peer chaincode query](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/commands/peerchaincode.html#peer-chaincode-query) . Is there such a function in the Fabric SDK Go?
</p>
<p><strong>jtonline</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 10:07:21 GMT):<br/>
To query the ledger without committing a transaction to the ledger, you can use EvaluateTransaction in the Go SDK, which is documented here...  
https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pkg/gateway#Contract.EvaluateTransaction

Hi everyone, has anybody got any successful attempt to connect the new slim sdks for version `2.4.0-beta` from a client to the peer? The samples provided here, https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-gateway/blob/main/samples/go/sample.go, i always get the `transport is closing` error while performing a transaction in the network, but the 'old' sdk as we know it, it works perfectly well. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

And this code is when calling the function via the gateway:
```
func QueryNFT(id string) ([]byte, error) {
	network := Gateway.GetNetwork("mychannel")
	contract := network.GetContract("erc721")

	evaluateResult, err := contract.EvaluateTransaction("ReadNFT", id)

	}

	zap.Logger.Debugf("submitResult of reading NFT %s: %s", id, string(evaluateResult))

	return evaluateResult, nil
}
```

<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 14:04:23 GMT):<br/>
Take note that `Gateway` is the object shared between the initialization and the chaincode being called.
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 14:06:31 GMT):<br/>
The problem is in your Connect method. When Connect finishes and returns control back to the caller, the defers run which close the grpc client and the gateway making the gateway unusable
</p>
<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 14:07:39 GMT):<br/>
Ah good spot! So the defer should be done outside the connect function right?
</p>
<p><strong>davidkel</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 14:10:12 GMT):<br/>
you should keep a copy of the Gateway and client connection. Once you are finished with them you close them. You may be able to make use of the `defer` golang to achieve that but you don't have to

<p><strong>vanitas92</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 14:11:28 GMT):<br/>
Understood, this is part of an API that will be listening to incomming connections, so actually defer would only makes sense if the container is killed or having a shutdown signal

Hello,

I have a problem with understanding the role of GO SDK in HLF and with Kubernetes. Here is the story.

First, I have managed to setup three test networks provided by fabric samples. My next step was trying to add an organization to test-network-k8s, and TBH it was quite complex to add and reconfigure data via bash/config files to manage such an action. Then, I found out that the way to do it is via GO SDK by creating an operator. So, I tried a few k8s operators, but I cannot say they enhanced my understanding. 

1) When building initial HLF infrastructure, do you build it programmatically with SDK? If no, which are the base components I need to setup (binaries, configs, other software)? 
2) How to connect HLF with the SDK? If I create go project and add SDK, how will the SDK recognize the HLF network, which configuration do I need to setup?

Any help would be appreciated

A v0.2.0 pre-release version of the new *fabric-gateway* client API for use with Fabric v2.4 has been published/tagged. This makes use of the new Fabric Gateway service in v2.4 peers, and provides completely consistent functionality to applications written in Go, Node and Java. Provided no stop-ship issues are identified, this is what we are planning to release alongside Fabric v2.4 as a supplement to the existing SDKs so please feel free to try it out and provide feedback.

Just a note that a current (development) build of the Fabric peer is required. This will not work with the v2.4 beta release. There is a `make pull-latest-peer` Makefile target in the fabric-gateway repository that will pull down and tag the latest peer images

I know this has been discussion in a GitHub issue, but the issue appears to be that the package of one of the protobufs was changed to avoid a circular dependency. So there is a difference between the older generated Go protobuf bindings used by fabric-sdk-go and the newer ones used by fabric-gateway

Also worth pointing out that in many cases you won't even need to use the WithEndorsingOrganizations option since the Gateway will dynamically detect the runtime endorsement requirements of a transaction and obtain endorsements from required organizations. But it is very useful to ensure that private data transmitted in transient data is not sent for endorsement to any organization that should not should not see the data

Hello all, I am trying to implement using the fabric-sdk-go a function that queries QSCC chaincode from peers. I found out that there are some test units that have been published in the fabric-sdk-go core files but I do not know how to create channelContext. It seems that in order to be able to create a sdk instance, firstly I need to load a configuration file. When I do that the following error appears:

`*Failed to create fabric sdk: failed to initialize configuration: unable to load endpoint config: failed to initialize endpoint config from config backend: network configuration load failed: failed to parse 'organizations' config item to endpointConfigurationEntity.Organizations type: '' expected a map, got 'slice'*`. 

The code snippet that I have used is the following:
`currentPath, err := os.Getwd()
		if err != nil {
			currentPathError := []byte(fmt.Sprintf("Failed to retrive current path: %s", err))
			w.Write([]byte(currentPathError))
    			return
		}
	
    		configPath := filepath.Join(
			currentPath,
			"..",
			"..",
			"..",
			"first-network",
			"configtx.yaml",
		)
		sdk, err := fabsdk.New(config.FromFile(configPath))

		if err != nil {
			sdkError := []byte(fmt.Sprintf("Failed to create fabric sdk: %s", err))
    			w.Write([]byte(sdkError))
    			return
		}
		
		ccp := sdk.ChannelContext("mychannel", fabsdk.WithUser("admin"), fabsdk.WithOrg("Org1MSP"))
		cc, err := channel.New(ccp)
		spew.Dump(cc)
		if err != nil {
			channelContectError := []byte(fmt.Sprintf("Failed to create channel client: %s", err))
			w.Write([]byte(channelContectError))
    			return
		}`

What is the correct config file that sdk instance is waiting?

this is the Fabric SDK Go channel, you might wanna try the #aries-go channel for Aries Framework Go related questions.. but to quickly answer your question:

the `verificationMethod.id` is not a KMS ID, it's the verification method ID, you can't treat it like a KMS ID
