{"msg":"@habpygo I am not sure if the actual message size limit can be altered. Probably its possible but would have to look into that.  What exactly are you adding to the chaincode? For example I ran into the same problems when I moved my chaincode to a standalone project and had to do govendor add +external to make my chaincode unit tests work.  However this created  a big sized vendor folder because of the hyperledger/fabric dependencies.  \n\nThe sdk basically just tars  your chaincode src folder and sends it so for me that was a no no.   For now I just moved my chaincode back into my main project (the one that uses the sdk) and I use the deployPath setting when installing the chaincode.   By doing that my unit tests just use the vendor folder of my main project and for the actual chaincode external packages I have a separate vendor folder inside my chaincode src folder.    So when installing the chaincode only the vendor folder in the chaincode src folder is included and all the rest is ignored.  For example to include ffjson.    \n\nOf course that was my situation. If you actually have a really big vendor folder with non related fabric stuff then there is not much you can do except for changing the message size limit or try to make your vendor folder small.

Inside this function you call protos_utils.CreateUpgradeProposalFromCDS instead of protos_utils.CreateDeployUpgradeProposalFromCDS and that is it.   You just have to have to work your way up to transactionconfig.go to provide all the necessary helper/wrapper functions to the top.  Of course you are editing your vendoring in package this way. You might also be able to just copy all this code to your own project.","username":"aneb","ts":"2017-09-07T04:51:58.858Z"}

{"msg":"Hi guys, I'm testing the balance-transfer example on ubuntu machine. I docerized node.js API in order to interact with fabric from remote app. I have exposed port 4000 on node.js and made a bridge with outside port to access node. Node.js uses JWS tokens for security. Yesterday I could execute sample REST API requests (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/master/balance-transfer#sample-rest-apis-requests) locally from command line. For example I could register/enroll user in the network, create channel, etc. However with the Postman toll I was getting errors like: Error: ECONNREFUSED localhost:8054, ECONNREFUSED localhost:7054, depends what user token I was using for request. That is my first problem.\n\nThe second problem came today, when jwt token was expired and it is normal, since it is configured that way (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/master/balance-transfer/config.json). But what I couldn't understand is that I even can not authenticate new user from localhost with cli. For instance, this login request doesn't return anything, it's not executing: curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4000/users -H \"content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" -d 'username=Jim&orgName=org1'\n\nIf any of you already faced the same issue please guide me.

{"msg":"Hi, I've got a question regarding the channel management client: I've written a bootstrapper that creates a channel (by sending a SaveChannelRequest to the orderer), joins peers to that channel, installs & instantiates chaincode etc. I want to make my bootstrapper idempotent, i.e. when it is executed on a network that has already been bootstrapped, the bootstrapper should not fail und just do nothing. I've managed to make the join channel / installl & instantiate chaincode parts idempotent, but I haven't found a way to make the channel creation via the orderer idempotent. When I send the same SaveChannelRequest (with the same channel configuration transaction) to the orderer, the SDK just return an generic error (without specifying the error's cause exactly). In the orderer logs, there is an entry that says that the request failed as the channel already exists. But I don't get that information via the SDK. How can I find out before sending the SaveChannelRequest that the channel has already been created? Is the only possibility to query a peer for a list of channels it has joined?","username":"ga25waq","ts":"2018-01-27T13:03:25.096Z"}

Delete all docker images, containers, remove the /tmp/enroll_user folder, /tmp/msp etc   And still, even after doing all those things when restarting everthing, which should be a complete reset of everything, when I start all and try to register an identity through the SDK I get the following:\n\n\n\n```\nca_peer***                 | {\"id\":\"yves@***-jp.com\",\"type\":\"user\",\"affiliation\":\"***.businessSolutions\",\"attrs\":[{\"name\":\"hf.Registrar.Roles\",\"value\":\"user\"},{\"name\":\"hf.Revoker\",\"value\":\"true\"}],\"caname\":\"ca-***\"}\nca_peer***                     | 2018/02/01 07:13:57 [DEBUG] Directing traffic to CA ca-******\nca_peer***                     | 2018/02/01 07:13:57 [DEBUG] Checking for revocation/expiration of certificate owned by 'admin'\nca_peer***                     | 2018/02/01 07:13:57 [DEBUG] DB: Get certificate by serial (75338fb6c4afa7073b27897c7a5a5fb82e21ffeb) and aki (36520ca3eb355f1b44e30a4b8e4db947506be0d2efe867a2b139985cd5b7017a)\nca_peer***                     | 2018/02/01 07:13:57 [DEBUG] Successful authentication of 'admin'\nca_peer***                     | 2018/02/01 07:13:57 [DEBUG] Register request received\nca_peer***                     | 2018/02/01 07:13:57 [DEBUG] Received registration request from admin: &{RegistrationRequest:{Name:yves@***-jp.com Type:user Secret:<<user-specified>> MaxEnrollments:0 Affiliation:indetail.businessSolutions Attributes:[{Name:hf.Registrar.Roles Value:user} {Name:hf.Revoker Value:true}] CAName:ca-indetail}}\nca_peer***                     | 2018/02/01 07:13:57 [DEBUG] canRegister - Check to see if user admin can register\nca_peer***                     | 2018/02/01 07:13:57 [DEBUG] DB: Getting identity admin\nca_peer***                     | 2018/02/01 07:13:57 [DEBUG] Validate ID\nca_peer***                     | 2018/02/01 07:13:57 [DEBUG] An affiliation is required for identity type user\nca_peer***                     | 2018/02/01 07:13:57 [DEBUG] Validating affiliation: ***.businessSolutions\nca_peer***                     | 2018/02/01 07:13:57 [DEBUG] DB: Get affiliation ***.businessSolutions\nca_peer***                     | 2018/02/01 07:13:57 [DEBUG] Registering user id: yves@***-jp.com\nca_peer***                     | 2018/02/01 07:13:57 [DEBUG] Max enrollment value verification - User specified max enrollment: 0, CA max enrollment: -1\nca_peer***                     | 2018/02/01 07:13:57 [DEBUG] DB: Getting identity yves@***-jp.com\nca_peer***                     | 2018/02/01 07:13:57 [DEBUG] Registration of 'yves@***-jp.com' failed: Identity 'yves@***-jp.com' is already registered\nca_peer***                     | 2018/02/01 07:13:57 [INFO] 172.19.0.1:35660 - \"POST /register\" 0\n```\n\nIt really feels as if I am missing something so very obvious but as far as I know deleting /tmp/msg /tmp/enroll_user, the actual CA container and in worst case the docker image should be more enough for a clean restart.  Unless my setup is somehow magically using a fabric-ca-server.db that is on my host but that would be strange.\n\nCould it be docker that is caching something?","username":"aneb","ts":"2018-02-01T07:58:40.291Z"}

{"msg":"Hi! I've created a new instance of ChannelClient and now I want to subscribe to a chaincode event via the ChannelClient's RegisterChaincodeEvent method. Unfortunately, it seems that the underlying event hub never gets connected (dumping the ChannelClient shows a 'connected: (bool) false' for its event hub). Do I have to connect the event hub manually? How can I do that for a ChannelClient? I had a look at base_test_setup.go where a new event hub is created and connected manually.

{"msg":"@troyronda Thanks for the fix! I did not have a look at every single line of code regarding the event management, but an EventHub is linked to a single peer. That is why the question arised if the SDK considers the validity of a transaction that leads to a chaincode event. In other words: If I require peers of two different organizations to endorse a transaction on a chaincode, is it guaranteed that the chaincode event (and its payload) received via a ChannelClient belongs to a validated and committed transaction (that fulfills the endorsement policy etc.)? Or can the peer(s) serving as an event hub manipulate the event at will (in that case the client would have to perform a separate query that gets validated after having received the event)?","username":"ga25waq","ts":"2018-02-13T18:18:44.200Z"}

{"msg":"@troyronda Thanks for providing the new delivery service! I've got two short questions: 1) in ./pkg/common/providers/fab/eventservice.go:43 it is stated that the CCEvent's payload is nil for filtered events. Indeed, I get nil payloads with a chaincode event handler registered via a channel client instance, specifying the chaincode ID and the event name. Is this the desired behaviour? If yes, how am I supposed to get the event's payload? 2) does the new delivery service solve the problem that a peer can manipulate an event at will (we've talked about this some weeks ago). I would think so, since the new delivery service seems to be channel-based, but I'm not completely sure about it.","username":"ga25waq","ts":"2018-03-22T02:37:43.738Z"}

{"msg":"@lignyxg User identity is resolved by looking up the user enrollment cert first, and then looking up the matching private key. You should be able to use any tool, as long as you put the resulting cert and key in proper places. When resolving the cert, SDK first looks at the user store (@client.credentialStore.path); if cert is found, the key is looked up in the crypto provider key store (HSM or @client.credentialStore.cryptoStore.path). If the identity is not resolved, SDK looks up embedded certs in client configuration; if not found, it looks up the org's MSP directory (@organizations.<org>.cryptoPath). If not found, \"user not found\" is reported. Otherwise, the matching private key is first searched in embedded keys in client configuration, then in the crypto provider key store, and finally in the org's MSP directory. The whole setup essentially attempts to support three use cases: embedded credentials in client configuration, pre-enrolled users in the org's MSP directory, and dynamically enrolled users - when the cert is in the user store and the key in the crypto provider's key store. There are naming conventions used by default implementations of the MSP store and user store. You need to follow them if you want to plant your externally generated certs there. To make sure you understand the conventions correctly, try to study and run https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/msp/enrollment_test.go, and observe how the newly enrolled user's cert and private key are stored . You can also implement your own cert store and let the SDK use it - see https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/msp/user_data_mgmt_test.go. Default org MSP store follows the format generated by the fabric cryptogen tool. Finally, you can implement your own MSP provider to have complete control over enrollment process (but that's for another tutorial).

{"msg":"@pankajcheema Let me correct myself: Channel configuration (which can be queried from a peer on the channel) contains information on all peers and orderers on the channel (among other info). This information is used by SDK, so if the app doesn't specify any targets for a transaction, SDK will automatically choose correct peers and orderers for the transaction. It will also perform retries on endorsement / commit by failing over to other peers/orderers from the channel configuration. This means that the app needs only a single peer in the configuration in order to transact with Fabric. This assumes the peer is trusted by the app (so the channel configuration queried from the peer is deemed genuine). If peers are not trusted, SDK needs to query channel configuration from multiple peers and to compare results, thus more than one peer in local configuration. App can specify channel.<chname>.policies.queryChannelConfig.minResponses to control the minimum number of peers required when querying the channel configuration.

I have a query, is it a common use case that CA can be used to issue certificate(s) for normal users like bob, alice etc (say managed by existing ldap etc). And then applications are implemented to use certificates issued for users instead of apps (post authentication of user against LDAP) to create channel client and call chain code operations? `sdk.ChannelContext(channelID, fabsdk.WithUser(orgName), fabsdk.WithIdentity(signID))`","username":"govinda-attal","ts":"2018-04-13T02:51:02.284Z"}

During registration and enrollment user information (enrollment cert, private key) is stored into SDK stores.

When resolving the cert, SDK first looks at the user store (@client.credentialStore.path); if cert is found, the key is looked up in the crypto provider key store (HSM or @client.credentialStore.cryptoStore.path).

When I did not remove docker container, fabric through errors like this:```\n Unable to initialize the Fabric SDK: Failed to create channel: create channel failed: SendEnvelope failed: calling orderer 'localhost:7050' failed: NewAtomicBroadcastClient failed: gRPC Transport Status Code: (4) DeadlineExceeded.

{"msg":"Hi @troyronda, is there a quick and dirty way to test whether a chaincode has already been installed on a channel?

Please advise. Thanks.","username":"habpygo","ts":"2018-05-18T12:44:17.876Z"}

{"msg":"[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=LbWgBmT9CukdDBivz) @kostas Sorry you are having this much trouble. It is true that the SDK will look for the cert in location configured by credentialStore.path, but only as a part of a broader search. Obviously, as you don't have any certs there, it won't find any, but then it should proceed by looking up any certs embedded in the configuration file, and finally under organizations.<org>.cryptoPath. Only when all these are exhausted the SDK will report user not found. I understand you expect the cert to be found in organizations.<org>.cryptoPath, so I am guessing it is not setup correctly. You can clone fabric-go-sdk master and run 'make crypto-gen'. This will generate test data under test/fixtures/fabric/v1/crypto-config. Then you can see how this location is referenced at https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/fa3c843d7b773521bbd56d0f429c87c8f6271195/test/fixtures/config/config_test.yaml#L92 and https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/fa3c843d7b773521bbd56d0f429c87c8f6271195/test/fixtures/config/config_test.yaml#L265.

{"msg":"Hello all,\n\n \nI’m learning hyperledger fabric and during testing I noted that Golang sdk for hyperledger allows to do only syncronious (modification) calls to fabric. Am I correct?\nHere is explanation.\n \n\nI have deployed “fabcar” example and tested different approaches of working with chaincode.\nMy client is written on Golang so I’m using Go-sdk to connect to ledger. I have subscribed on block events, to receive notification, when new block is attached to the ledger. During chaincode invokation with adding new data into ledger, I noted that block event is received earlier than code, which invoked ledger change, finished.\n\nFor example:\n\nFirst in code I’m registering block event listener:\n\nbreg, beventch, err := eventClient.RegisterBlockEvent()\n…\nselect {\n\tcase e, ok := <-beventch:\n\t\tif ok {\n\t\t\tlog.Println(\"Block event is received\")\n\t\t}\n…\n \n\nAnd then invoking chaincode to update ledger:\n\nresponse, err = chClient.Execute(channel.Request{\n\tChaincodeID: chaincode_id,\n\tFcn: fcn,\n\tArgs: args,\n\t}, channel.WithRetry(retry.DefaultChannelOpts))\n\nlog.Print(\"HLF Invoking ended\")\n\n\nAnd output appeares in this order:\n“Block event is received”\n“HLF Invoking ended”\n\nI.e. new block event is received earlier than code which “created” that block finishes.\nIt looks strange for me, because I thought, that we just send request to orderer service and not waiting competion of transaction. But it looks like in this request there is a waiting until tx(new block) will be added into ledger.\nDuring sdk investigation I found, that code, which sends a proposal to orderer, subscribes on transaction event and waits until transaction status is received. I.e. transaction is commited.\n\nCode links:\n\nInitial invoke from my code: channel.Execute() line 108: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/chclient.go\nSend proposal from go-sdk: invoke.Handle() line 167: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/invoke/txnhandler.go\nHere on line 171 it subscribes on tx event:\n\treg, statusNotifier, err := clientContext.EventService.RegisterTxStatusEvent(string(txnID))\nThen sends TX to orderer:\n\t_, err = createAndSendTransaction(clientContext.Transactor, requestContext.Response.Proposal, requestContext.Response.Responses)\n\nAnd wait until tx event is received:\nselect {\n\tcase txStatus := <-statusNotifier:\n \n\no   Is my understanding correct and “Execute” method is syncronius and it will return response only after transaction is commited to ledger, i.e. new block is added to chain?\no   To make is async it’s possible to run “Execute” in separate go routine, but the process will live untill transaction is commited. I.e. if I run 1000 txs, in memory will be 1000 processes which will run at the same time.\nSo if it’s necessary 1 hour to get reponse from all of them, but I send new request (# 1001), it will stuck untill these 1000 txs are processed. Am I right?\no   Is that possible to do an async request? Is it necessary override \"Execute\" method and manually send requests to peers, collect responses and then send propsal request to orderer(without subscribing on tx events). Correct?\n\n\nThanks in advance for help.","username":"Maxim_Samarin","ts":"2019-01-25T07:57:02.055Z"}

{"msg":"Hello @sherbetlemon, @nyet, \nTwo cents from me regarding Execute call (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/chclient.go#L108) and my investigations on this question.\n@sherbetlemon I think you are right and \"Execute\" responds after tx was committed by peer.\nThis method calls cc.InvokeHandler (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/chclientrun.go#L35), which uses chain of handlers created by \"invoke.NewExecuteHandler()\"\nBy these handlers we can check which operations are done, but the most interesting for us is the last one \"NewCommitHandler(next...)\" (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/invoke/txnhandler.go#L220)\nIn its \"Handle\" method (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/invoke/txnhandler.go#L167) \nwe can see that it registers tx event listener (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/invoke/txnhandler.go#L171)\nsends tx to orderer (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/invoke/txnhandler.go#L178)\nand waits for event (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/pkg/client/channel/invoke/txnhandler.go#L184)\nand quits the method only after timeout or event is received.\nSo per my understanding \"Execute\" is synchronous method for sending transactions to blockchain. Accordingly if there is a loop of txs to be sent in one thread, each next will wait until previous one has went through the full flow, i.e. committed to blockchain. \nSo it seems that with increasing number of txs, time will be increased, i.e. each new will wait for completion of previous transactions. So it seems, that it's necessary to send each tx (call execute) in it's own goroutine (thread). \nPlease correct me if I missed something or wrong.","username":"Maxim_Samarin","ts":"2019-02-01T10:39:59.821Z"}

But already inside sdk, if we have registered chaincode listener, sdk will take data about chaincode from \"Block event\" and if it matches pattern, registered callback will be executed.\nSame for tx listener.\nThis might be visible here for block - https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/v1.0.0-alpha4/pkg/fab/events/service/dispatcher/dispatcher.go#L301\nand here for filtered block - https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/v1.0.0-alpha4/pkg/fab/events/service/dispatcher/dispatcher.go#L314\nBoth handlers for publishing \"cc\" and \"tx\" events use same \"publishFilteredBlockEvents\".\nI.e. sdk receives 1 Block event and 1 Filtered Block event, and depending on registered listeners, decides which callbacks to call(blocks, chaincodes or transactions)\nAnd it seems, that there is no way to get tx event if we are using \"Execute\". \"RegisterTxStatusEvent\" requires TxID, which is generated inside \"Execute\" and returned when method is finished. \nBut due to \"Execute\" itself catches \"Tx\" event, listener registered after Execute function will fail by timeout. (At least my test works only if tx listener inside \"Execute\" is disabled)","username":"Maxim_Samarin","ts":"2019-02-04T14:18:41.049Z","attachments":[{"message_link":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=FXfMZuZjkcW3t5y5T","url":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-sdk-go?msg=FXfMZuZjkcW3t5y5T","remote":true,"fileId":null,"fileName":null}]}

{"msg":"hi Fabric Developers\n\njust letting you know about the \"Hyperledger Fabric Developer\" community call (lasts approx 30-60 mins) currently scheduled for  Thursday February 7th 5pm UTC (5pm UK, 12pm ET, 9am PT). \n\nThe plan is to initially host this community call bi-weekly via Zoom webconference and is aimed at :\n\n- helping the worldwide Fabric Developer community grow in their development journey (eg.  developing applications, smart contracts, chaincode,  developing clients, using the SDK etc - eg. whether its NodeJS, Java, Go etc etc) \n- caters for the developer perspective and the developer community.\n- help developers understand / hear more about exciting new things in Fabric,eg. features upcoming or work in progress - ie things that appeal to the developer\n- to foster more interest, best practices etc in developing with Hyperledger Fabric.  \n- opportunity to ask questions of the Fabric team eg. you may have feedback/questions on your experiences developing with Fabric\n- to share stuff you've done with the community, eg sample code / sample use cases that others may be interested in\n\nIf you wish to share content on a call, just let me know via email direct or DM me on Rocketchat (ID: mahoney1) and I'll put an item on the agenda. Provide the following:\n-  the topic (state whether its presentation, or demo etc)\n- the full name of the presenter, and \n- approx length of your pitch in minutes\n\nThe Zoom webconference ID is https://zoom.us/my/hyperledger.community   and the aim is to grow interest in the Fabric developer ecosystem (this 'Fabric Developer' call clearly has a much broader scope as indicated - feel free to make suggestions too  !). \n\nThe current agenda is shown here -> https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/fabric/Fabric+Developer+-+Meeting+Agendas+\n\nmany thanks for your time - feel free to forward this email if you think it is of interest to a colleague. \n\nPaul O'Mahony\nCommunity Lead\nFabric Developer","username":"mahoney1","ts":"2019-02-04T15:24:39.148Z"}

{"msg":"@xixuejia for discovery of peers not on a channel (local peers), there is a simple test: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/pkg/client/common/discovery/discoveryclient_test.go#L108\nfor discovery of peers on a channel, you need to make sure the peers have joined a channel and chaincodes are installed/instantiated (the test has a bit of prep work to set all things up, but technically the discovery client call is similar to the test above) see: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/pkg/client/common/discovery/discoveryclient_test.go#L44, note the difference is the channelID being passed at this line: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/pkg/client/common/discovery/discoveryclient_test.go#L59 ","username":"Baha-sk","ts":"2019-03-27T18:58:05.543Z"}

However, my application cannot send transaction proposal to the peers. The weird thing is when I launch the app the sdk client is created without errors (the peers logs request coming from the IP of the app host) but I can't register chaincode event and the error returned is \"no peers to connect to\". The issue came from the  dispatcher.go located at fabric-sdk-go/pkg/fab/events/client/dispatcher/dispatcher.go. It seems I get an empty array from the GetPeers() function. I don't understand why the connection is possible for the creation of the SDK client but is impossible when registering chaincode event. The version of the binairies I use is v1.2.0.

As of now - I need to investigate what build command is being used by the docker daemon to build the image of chaincode container - programmatically - when the deploy operation takes place as part of lscc flow [at the time of instantiate invocation].

{"msg":"@medikent From the Fabric CA point of view, a Fabric CA client (an application which manages Fabric user registration/enrollment/etc) first registers a new user by calling the Fabric CA registration API. The resulting user name and enrollment secret are passed out of band to the new user. The user then needs to enroll with the CA by creating a key pair, then creating a CSR, and finally enrolling with the CA by calling the CA enrollment API. The result of the enrollment is a certificate signed by the CA which the new user provides as its identity when talking to Fabric nodes (peers and orderers). The Go SDK can help by providing partial or full support for this process. The MSP client of the SDK can do both the new user registration, as well as the enrollment. During enrollment, the SDK accepts the username and the enrollment secret (from registration), and first creates a key pair. The private key is stored in the Key Store, and the public key is used to create a CSR. The SDK than calls the Fabric CA to enroll the user. The resulting certificate is returned to the caller. It is also stored in the User Store, for future lookup by the username. The default User Store is a simple file store. SDK client can provide its own implementation of the User Store interface at the time of the SDK instantiation. For crypto operations, the SDK by default delegates to fabric BCCSP library. The SDK can be configured with either \"SW\" (software) or \"pkcs11\" implementation of the BCCSP crypto interfaces. The \"SW\" uses a simple file store implementation of the Key Store interface  for storing private keys, while \"pkcs11\" uses HSM. When making calls to fabric nodes, an SDK client need to provide its identity. It can be done either by providing only a username (in which case the SDK looks up the certificate and the private key from its stores), or by providing the certificate and the private key. The latter allows the SDK client to have its own key management independent from the SDK. You can take a look at https://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/pkg/client/msp , also https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/pkg/client/msp/enrollment_test.go, https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/pkg/client/msp/identity_test.go, https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/blob/master/test/integration/pkg/client/msp/user_data_mgmt_test.go.

{"msg":"Hi. I am facing an issue, that sometimes when invoking chaincode, I get an error message on grpc level like: \"certificate signed by unknown authority\". For me it seems that the sdk tries to talk to a peer node of another organization. Since TLS is enabled I wonder where my fabric-sdk gets the  ca-tls-cert of the other organizations, because initially it only knows the CA-tls-certs of its \"own\" organization (through the custom-endpoint). But when the discovery service tries to discover new peers of the known channels, it calls \"customEndpoint.PeerConfig(<peername>)\" at some point. But I am not able to set a tls-cert of the given peer, since I do not know it.  What is the correct way to handle this?","username":"Alexoid83","ts":"2019-08-27T14:58:46.737Z"}

I think that the paper-net sample can be implemented in Go, using ABAC, although I have not seen anyone tried to put it together.  It is missing a Go utility for managing wallet of x509 keys similar to the js utility used by the paper-net sample.  However, you can generate the user keys by using a CA server.  For example, start the byfn network with \"-a\" option, and then generate the keys for paper-net users of the 2 bank orgs, and then write your chaincode to call cid lib API that extracts and verifies user attributes in paper-net transactions.  With that said, I wish that fabric-sdk-go would provide a utility to support wallet similar to the js sdk.","username":"yxuco","ts":"2019-08-29T02:20:50.322Z"}

{"msg":"@kopaygorodsky hey, we've been thinking about the best approach to this. The thing is, we don't like that SDK has fabric code in its codebase. We would prefer that fabric was written in a modular way, where common libraries used by e.g. peer, orderer, command line tools, etc., are in its own project(s), and peer, orderer, SDK, etc. use them from there. Fabric already started a bit on this, externalizing fabric-protos-go and creating fabric-lib-go as a placeholder project where fabric libraries will eventually reside.\n\nHere is the JIRA ticket which describes this need from the SDK point of view https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-16461. Basically, we are saying that SDK needs parts of the fabric functionality, but the only way to use it currently is to copy the code into the SDK codebase. We would rather remove all copies of fabric code from SDK and import them from fabric-lib-go. In retrospect, exposing parts of fabric configtxgen and configtxlator codebase in SDK might have been an error. Now you are asking that the SDK exposes more fabric functions. If we keep it up, SDK will soon become a dump for fabric functions whose happy home should be fabric-lib-go.\n\nPerhaps it's time that people start creating pull requests in fabric-lib-go for functions they need to use from there. My company is working on some projects which will need some common fabric go functions, so we are very interested in contributing. However, we also want to move fast, that is, we don't want to be dependent on possibly long delays caused by necessary process bottlenecks like code reviews, design considerations, etc. So we decided to start a repository with our own flavour of fabric-lib-go (building it using the same code-copy mechanism used by SDK) and use fabric functions from there until they become available in hyperledger. SDK will for now keep what's there, but at some point we should probably deprecate configtxgen and configtxlator functions in SDK.\n\nAny thoughts?","username":"aleksandar.likic","ts":"2019-10-15T20:24:27.623Z"}

Fabric already started a bit on this, externalizing fabric-protos-go and creating fabric-lib-go as a placeholder project where fabric libraries will eventually reside.\n\nHere is the JIRA ticket which describes this need from the SDK point of view https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-16461.

We would rather remove all copies of fabric code from SDK and import them from fabric-lib-go.

{"msg":"1. Yes, the Gateway SDK will be implemented using the existing APIs.  There will be no breaking changes to the existing SDK/APIs\n2. The Go Gateway SDK will have the same concepts and structures as the Node/Java Gateway SDK, but will use idiomatic Go syntax.  So it will use pointers since they are fundamental to Go.  Java/Node will continue to be supported and developed so users can stay with those if they don't like Go syntax.\n3. The Go Gateway SDK will be fully documented and supported.

In summary, to use my custom logging system, I initialized `FabricSDK` object using `fabsdk.New()` method then injected it to my `Gateway` object using `WithSDK` option. However, the transaction submission fails and encounters TRANSIENT_FAILURE. When I'm using only `Gateway` with `WithConfig`, the submission works fine. At that time, the only problem was logging messages printed by `fabric-sdk-go`. \n\nSo, my question is one of them: How can I disable `fabric-sdk-go`'s default logging system only using `Gateway` package, or How can I handle `TRANSIENT_FAILURE` error.

If no, which are the base components I need to setup (binaries, configs, other software)? \n2) How to connect HLF with the SDK?
