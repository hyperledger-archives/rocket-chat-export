{"msg":"Hi Team,\n\nCongratulations for your successful participation in rolling Block chain Hyperledger. I am a newbie and thinking to be a contributor but not sure in which area I should try. I have installed Fabric component and do have inclination to deep dive into Fabric and Composer projects. I have tried these on Ubuntu – v16.04 (xenial) platform.\n\nCan some pointer or task be shared initially so that I can try contributing in that specific area? I may be good in working or developing some USE CASE applications.\n\nI do appreciate in participating in discussions so please do involve me. I am based in New Delhi, India.

{"msg":":woo:  @wangdong ready for ur question, now?","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-07-28T03:16:23.340Z"}
{"msg":"有一个操作，我比较看困惑，在做这个测试的时候，node sdk 需要把配置文件的所有node enroll.如果他们都在网络而且互相有关系，那他们肯定已经enroll 了，为什么还要enroll。","username":"wangdong","ts":"2017-07-28T03:16:26.387Z"}
{"msg":"enroll我理解就是把节点在ca注册，获得身份","username":"wangdong","ts":"2017-07-28T03:16:57.214Z"}
{"msg":"enroll means to let the fabric network recognize the client.","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-07-28T03:17:02.486Z"}
{"msg":"each client is independent with each other.","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-07-28T03:17:15.094Z"}
{"msg":"so every client need to enroll himself.","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-07-28T03:17:25.054Z"}
{"msg":"so is this answering ur question?","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-07-28T03:17:58.587Z"}
{"msg":"但是这些节点在docker compose 起来的时候不是都已经在网络里面了么","username":"wangdong","ts":"2017-07-28T03:18:02.688Z"}
{"msg":"你的意思是当客户端链接这些节点的时候比如重新enroll?","username":"wangdong","ts":"2017-07-28T03:18:34.556Z"}
{"msg":"yeap, in this case, these nodes work like client to enroll themselves.","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-07-28T03:18:37.762Z"}
{"msg":"必须","username":"wangdong","ts":"2017-07-28T03:18:42.175Z"}
{"msg":"nooo.","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-07-28T03:18:46.527Z"}
{"msg":"to keep the e2e case more simple, we can simple write down like : 1) client enrolls in the network; 2) client installs a chaincode to some peer; 3) client instantiates the chaincode; 4) client invokes the chaincode.","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-07-28T03:19:43.292Z"}
{"msg":"does this make sense?","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-07-28T03:19:52.058Z"}
{"msg":"more details can be added after we pass through the basic workflow.","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-07-28T03:20:11.929Z"}
{"msg":"so when the compose up ,these nodes are not enrolled, right","username":"wangdong","ts":"2017-07-28T03:20:29.023Z"}
{"msg":"?","username":"wangdong","ts":"2017-07-28T03:20:33.238Z"}
{"msg":"if u mean the compose.yaml inside sdk-py project, yes, no need to enroll them.","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-07-28T03:20:58.881Z"}
{"msg":"only client sdk needs to enroll now.","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-07-28T03:21:15.401Z"}
{"msg":"@grapebaba any comments?","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-07-28T03:21:23.138Z"}
{"msg":"i haven't seen those codes","username":"grapebaba","ts":"2017-07-28T03:22:18.421Z"}
{"msg":"@wangdong any more confusing now?","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-07-28T03:22:45.624Z"}
{"msg":"since CA is not necessary, i assume nodes no need to enroll when docker-compose up","username":"grapebaba","ts":"2017-07-28T03:23:07.266Z"}
{"msg":"OK, 我问的简洁些，当compose up 的时候，这些节点已经enroll了。我在操作的时候不需要重新enroll 了哈","username":"wangdong","ts":"2017-07-28T03:23:35.992Z"}
{"msg":"应该没有enroll","username":"grapebaba","ts":"2017-07-28T03:23:58.040Z"}
{"msg":"yeap, enroll once, then u will get all the required cert/key files.","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-07-28T03:23:58.533Z"}
{"msg":"yeap, client enrolls once, then u will get all the required cert/key files.","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-07-28T03:23:58.533Z"}
{"msg":"因为可以 不要ca","username":"grapebaba","ts":"2017-07-28T03:24:13.926Z"}
{"msg":"也能启动网络","username":"grapebaba","ts":"2017-07-28T03:24:26.214Z"}
{"msg":"@wangdong the sdk-py is to design a client sdk, so u do not need to care the peer nodes, actually.","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-07-28T03:24:50.790Z"}
{"msg":"嗯， 我只想搞清楚他们怎么工作的。不然我只能依照node 来写。","username":"wangdong","ts":"2017-07-28T03:25:32.581Z"}
{"msg":"any more issue?","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-07-28T03:25:32.792Z"}

{"msg":"somehow, the node one is very complicated, can just use as a reference.","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-07-28T03:26:52.121Z"}

My implementation is a little java flavor. I referred to the java sdk a lot.\nI can see yours is javascript style. But your code is superb. I really admire that. Well, my point is you may not review my\npatches. And the overlapped part always wastes our time. we did the duplicated job. And I have asked you about this job status.\nI thought you knew what i have done. So my advice is, as a maintainer, you can always review the patch. And give the your advice,\nif something is not that perfect. we can spend time discussing. Let's just make it better together.

(To be more detailed: `tran_req` needs `res` which is returned by `send_instantiate_proposal`) When I try to send the tx proposal of invoke first and build tx from it, I got `TypeError: '_Rendezvous' object does not support indexing` error.

The `utils.send_transaction` part in the `chaincode_invoke` method.\nActually, this part is needed, otherwise nothing will be reflected to the other peers.\nBut, the real issue is these method should not even belong to the code. It should live in a tutorial or utils part. As described here: https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/tutorial-channel-events.html (Transaction listener part). We can also see it in action here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/blob/release-1.4/fabcar/javascript-low-level/invoke.js\nIt does not belong to the SDK. But should be heavily documented and provided for allowing developper to understand how it works and give a basic implementation.\nRight now, we do not have the channelEventHub part which is mandatory if we want to know our invoke transaction has been correctly validated to be synchronized among peers.\nWe will start working on this topic with my team, but it is not our priority and we will need active help.","username":"GuillaumeCisco","ts":"2019-01-31T08:48:37.115Z"}

{"msg":"@GuillaumeCisco The first event service is called eventhub which comes from peers. user would have to use it along with peer, creating an event service, connecting, listening the specific peer. But there were some problem with this design. You will have to take care all the details, connecting and disconnecting or reuse. People always get confused when to reuse it. And there are so many issue in this. And other users can not get the event service from other peers in the same channel. Then here comes the channel event service. It is based on channel. client can register the event service and it will not have to take care the peer. And the event will be distributed to the channel. The registered client can get them. 1. As I see your get_event is block event. There are three kind of events now, the other two are chain code and transaction 2. This kind of events should be asynchronous event. I did not get how did you cope with this. Previously we handle this with queue and rx module. But we planed to implement await/async. So the best design(from my mind) is to design this event service as standalone class and it should expose API to client or channel. Yes of course I am affected by nodejs sdk. I think it is a good reference. ","username":"wangdong","ts":"2019-03-17T13:40:35.778Z"}

{"msg":"And after the review, I got some thoughts about the code style and design work.\n1. About the folded line: Our style now is a little ugly. We fold the line with will which break the lines unconditionally, making them unreadability.\n2. About the variable naming: We should try our best to make the variables self-explained. The script languages like python, nodes make the variable reclaiming very cheap. people can acclaim variable as their will when they want.\nBut this is not good, especially for some big project. This will drive other developer crazy when to read the code. So I would like advise to not use the single letter variables, especially which spreads multiple lines or blocks.\nOne line style could be the exception. \n3. About the patch size. Let’s break the big patch into small ones. It would be easy to review and the quality will be guarranteed. Small steps make great progress. \n4. About the modularization, I would advise to make the low level service modulated, like discovery, event service. Later we will have more service enabled in fabric, token system, metrics service.\nWe make them modulated and it will be very flexible later for our job, making the sdk more scalable and the structure clear. So please reconsider this when to design the feature.","username":"wangdong","ts":"2019-03-23T01:57:33.417Z"}
