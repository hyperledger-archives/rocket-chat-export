Now that the repos are moved over, Docker Hub builds are not triggering automatically. Ry suggested we move to GitHub Actions / GitHub Artifacts for our Docker images. I'm going to work on this now, because as of right now, the CLI won't be able to grab any newer builds from this point on.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 09 Jun 2021 17:47:59 GMT):<br/>
we can go back and set up dockerhub for the labs, it's just with. the recent changes for free projects, I don't think we can do ci/cd with it
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 09 Jun 2021 17:50:48 GMT):<br/>
Ah that makes sense. It might be nice to just do everything in GitHub anyway

The CLI is still setting `kld-from` rather than `fly-from` so it doesn't work with the current version of `firefly-ethconnect`. Fixing that now...

The sample UI application also got an overhaul today and gives a good hands-on of the broadcast capability. Once the remaining migration issues are sorted out in the CLI, this is hopefully a really easy way for people to get a quick touch at a high level.

Need to add actual private transfer capabilities to this sample next.

I'm working on tackling open issues against FireFly CLI, specifically bugs related to startup in various types of dev environments. It looks like several open issues have their root cause in permissions issues around the postgresql data directory. I'm investigating that now.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 17 Jun 2021 14:43:47 GMT):<br/>
Looks like a lot of the current issues we're seeing can be solved by using named volumes rather than creating volume mounts on the local file system. The current behavior of the CLI using the file system is especially convoluted when running Docker inside WSL on Linux.

Is there any need for the KAT code in the firefly repo?  The depend on vendor services and the kat code lives in the kaleido-io version of the repo, so it is still accessible otherwise.

@saif_32 Which version of the CLI are you running? You can check by looking to see what version is listed on the `firefly-cli` directory in your `go` directory: ```ls ~/go/pkg/mod/github.com/hyperledger-labs/```
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 12:27:21 GMT):<br/>
A new version was released yesterday that has a bunch of fixes in it. If you haven't updated to `v0.0.18`, try running: ```go install github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly-cli/ff@latest```

Was this stack originally created with the older version of the CLI? If the DB got into a bad migration state due to a previous timing issue (fixed in the most recent CLI), you'll need to recreate the DB for that node. The easiest thing to do is probably `ff remove ffstack` then `ff init ffstack` and `ff start ffstack`

First of all I really appreciate the amount of work that has been put in! Feedback - *1*. If we can have a use-case/demo that can show where firefly fits in the onchain-offchain scheme of things - just to know and understand the usability of firefly in a better way! *2*. If we can have a live session which can demonstrate how we connect firefly to a blockchain - that will be great!

We do have https://github.com/kaleido-io/firefly-samples to demonstrate the basic concept of some off-chain message (either public or private) with the hash pinned to the chain. Planning to eventually add some more "real world" samples as well.

@Andrew.Richardson yeah checked that... it helps! It is good for getting started. If we can have some workshop where we do the connections between different components from scratch, we can have a clearer idea!!

Hi guys, I am trying to understand lgtm java build failure on the PR above?
</p>
<p><strong>shantaraam</strong> (Fri, 09 Jul 2021 21:19:30 GMT):<br/>
Can I get some information on what version of jdk lgtm is configured with
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 12 Jul 2021 12:34:34 GMT):<br/>
Hi @shantaraam, the details of why  the check failed can be found here: https://lgtm.com/projects/g/hyperledger-labs/firefly-cordaconnect/logs/rev/pr-613dd587028877f860e04020123aa5c255243945/lang:java/stage:Build%20merge_181c4dec7e60360bb7322dc1954c35f133d63f66

It looks like the check failed because the code will not build after merging the PR, even though the code in the PR itself builds correctly.
</p>
<p><strong>shantaraam</strong> (Mon, 12 Jul 2021 13:52:42 GMT):<br/>
Thanks nicko for the information. I am trying to figure out why that is. ? I am not seeing the build errors locally and figuring out why that might be so.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 12 Jul 2021 13:55:29 GMT):<br/>
Off the top of my head I'm not sure. So you're saying you've tried merging the branch into main locally and that builds correctly?
</p>
<p><strong>shantaraam</strong> (Mon, 12 Jul 2021 14:15:51 GMT):<br/>
yes. I tried merge and build locally

For this week's community call, we will discuss the current architecture design for the Fabric connector. the repository has been updated with the diagrams that we will walk through tomorrow: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly-fabconnect. implementation is being done in parallel. hope the first code drop can be pushed soon. but of course we'll take into account any feedback we might get in the meanwhile, before getting committed to the current design

</p>
<p><strong>janrockdev</strong> (Fri, 16 Jul 2021 13:33:55 GMT):<br/>
Hi, maybe when will be Jim's initial code push available, integration with Firefly (cli, UI to show connector state and config + Kafka micro UI to manage topics > life cycle management), Firefly security (+ Kafka SSL etc), also a transactions generator for dev and test the API/benchmark/code optimisation, non-functional requirements - throughput/supported version/OS etc., documentation + error conventions etc.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 16 Jul 2021 17:51:08 GMT):<br/>
Good question! I'll nudge @jimthematrix on this one :slight_smile:

thanks Jan for noticing already! Nicko is going to review and merge it soon, in the meanwhile, please take a look and let me know your thoughts. I think some options for you to get started in contributing:
- adding tests: since a lot of the code are refactored from `firefly-ethconnect`, we should be able to borrow a lot of the test code as well. even thought none of the packages are done yet, some of them are pretty agnostic to the DLT, like `kvstore`, `rest/receipt`, and `ws`, so adding tests for those packages should be possible now
- implementing the signing identity management component: this one is currently missing entirely, as it's pretty independent from the rest. create a package, say `internal/identity`, and implement the handler to POST/GET signing identities, to register and enroll users

Hi, is this something known and easy to fix - I'm trying to send broadcast message and it seems to struggle to share it. Please help ;)
```
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/go-resty/resty/v2"
)

func main() {
	client := resty.New()

	resp, err := client.R().
		SetHeader("Content-Type", "application/json").
		SetBody([]byte(`{"value":"test"}`)).
		Post("http://192.168.0.234:5000/api/v1/namespaces/default/broadcast/message")

	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("%v", err)
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("%v", resp.Status)
	}
}
```

<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 12:46:39 GMT):<br/>
@janrockdev I'm just tried the same request on my machine. I'm not sure why it's `pending` on one node but `succeeded` on the other. I'll look into that though. But the body of your request is not quite right. You're sending:
```json
{
    "value": "Hello world"
}
```
But it should be:
```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "value": "Hello world"
        }
    ]
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>janrockdev</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 13:02:03 GMT):<br/>
```SetBody([]byte(`{"data":[{"value":"Hello world"}]}`)).``` makes no difference on the pending status, rebuild (ff stop/remove/init/start) makes no difference too :(
</p>

Hmm let me try real quick....
</p>
<p><strong>janrockdev</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 13:05:47 GMT):<br/>
it's a bug in FF, because firefly-samples(private-data-transfer-cli) crashed as well
```
> private-data-transfer-cli@1.0.0 start
> ts-node src/index.ts

Broadcasting data values from firefly1: Hello,World
Failed to run: Error: No message received
```
</p>
<p><strong>janrockdev</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 13:07:58 GMT):<br/>
few times restart will help ... I noticed similar behaviour yesterday as well
</p>
<p><strong>janrockdev</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 13:08:27 GMT):<br/>
docker containers up, no visible issue
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 13:24:05 GMT):<br/>
After I attempted a broadcast with an HTTP body of
```json
{
    "value": "Hello world"
}
```
It seemed like all broadcasts after that (with proper message payloads) also got stuck in `pending` on the node I was sending from. However, I was able to reset my stack and things are working normally. I'm guessing that initial message didn't get processed correctly and caused everything after that to get stuck. Obviously this is not expected. I'll see if I can figure out why that message got stuck in pending. Thanks for reporting this!
</p>
<p><strong>janrockdev</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 13:50:24 GMT):<br/>
I think it's related to ff stop/start <env name> ...if it's brand new env after reboot no issue. Safe way to test if all works is pull firefly-samples/private-data-transfer-cli and $npm run start.
</p>
<p><strong>janrockdev</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 13:50:34 GMT):<br/>
Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>janrockdev</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 13:53:18 GMT):<br/>
All works perfectly now. I will try to replicate the error later and check the containers' logs.

<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 23 Jul 2021 18:43:44 GMT):<br/>
We have a couple of repos in TypeScript if you want to jump in with a language you're already familiar with:
https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly-dataexchange-https
https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly-ui
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 23 Jul 2021 18:44:26 GMT):<br/>
Our existing sample apps are in this repo: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly-samples
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 23 Jul 2021 18:45:39 GMT):<br/>
Like you said, a "production-ready" example would be awesome if building an app on top of FireFly would be interesting to you. TypeScript would also be perfect for this.

#fabconnect Hi, I have ready docker-compose.yaml for standalone Kafka with UI and support code to create topics + tests (I think we will need at least 3 topics, ffin/ffout/fflog). I can add it to fabconnect cli to install it (as optional) maybe with future alternative e.g. https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger if someone does not want to have Kafka in the stack. I can open new PR and you can decide.
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Sun, 25 Jul 2021 20:09:15 GMT):<br/>
thanks Jan! this would be very useful in local integration tests. if they can be saved under a folder "test/integration" that'd be ideal. don't think installing integration test fixture via the CLI is necessary. Looking forward to seeing a PR for this!
</p>
<p><strong>janrockdev</strong> (Mon, 26 Jul 2021 10:32:11 GMT):<br/>
I'm thinking to add two things:
1) option to create/remove Kafka standalone node for the purpose of the connector using CLI (I think it would be nice to have this option if Kafka will be part of the connector and FireFly is about "autoinstall all")
2) add a local integration test (test/integration/kafka) to test Kafka created from CLI (1) and run a test: create topics (ffin/ffout/fflog) > produce a message to ffin > consume message from ffin > remove the topics (expected connector will create them when start).
</p>

It would be great to be able to create a FireFly stack with the CLI that uses Fabric/fabconnect. Right now it's only limited to Ethereum/ethconnect, but it would be awesome to have options to pick one or the other

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/firefly-lab?msg=5zWb8ug2Wvrrss8Px) @janrockdev Just wanted to follow up on this issue. This got fixed in a PR that was recently merged. Here is the commit that contained the fix: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly/pull/142/commits/97e398f193a390fd1b23d915ca1563c325bf54da
</p>
<p><strong>janrockdev</strong> (Mon, 26 Jul 2021 17:44:35 GMT):<br/>
It has been a mix of two issues. One was the format, which was my mistake :) and the second related to firefly and issue to broadcast messages after stop and start. Thanks, I will retest it.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 26 Jul 2021 17:45:44 GMT):<br/>
Yes, this fix was for the latter. The issue was that a message with no data elements would end up getting "stuck" on the sender's node and never confirmed
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 27 Jul 2021 12:40:27 GMT):<br/>
agree that the option to stand up a local stack integrating fabconnect would be a logical step. can have the kafka setup as part of the FireFly CLI experience. obviously it wouldn't be the default config for using fabconnect (direct handler for the async requests should be the default which would be the case if kafka config is not present)

agree that the option to stand up a local stack integrating fabconnect would be a logical step. can have the kafka setup as part of the developer experience with FireFly CLI. obviously it wouldn't be the default config for using fabconnect (direct handler for the async requests should be the default which would be the case if kafka config is not present)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 27 Jul 2021 12:42:36 GMT):<br/>
when I said "don't think installing integration test fixture via the CLI is necessary", I was referring to the `fabconnect` executable itself. setting up Kafka should be outside of the fabconnect functionalities. sorry if that was confusing earlier

@jimthematrix I agree. It would be clean solution. I can add it to Firefly-cli if you will like it. The integration test is basically spinning latest Kafka with UI, creating topic, producing and consuming message and removing all Kafka containers after the test. If it will be optional part of Firefly-cli, then the test will be without the docker-compose part. Hopefully I will have time tonight. It works now, but I have to put the code to firefly style - e.g. no comments, etc :D
</p>

Please, could you have a look first to my repo: https://github.com/defidbpub/firefly-fabconnect/tree/main/test/integration/cli where is temporary the Kafka deployment. Integration test will evaluate if this Kafka server is up, topic ready, and using Kafka client from /internal/kafka. Please, let me know if it is useful and what to improve. It passed your workflow test. ;)

A new update to the FireFly CLI was just published (`v0.0.25`). Some changes in this version include:
- Ganache CLI has been replaced by a proper geth node - This fixes some edge cases where ganache-cli behaved differently causing problems for Firefly.
- The ability to run a FireFly core process outside of docker. This lets developers run the FireFly core with their IDE debugger while connecting that core process to a FireFly network where the rest of the processes are running inside docker. This should speed up the development cycle and make it easier for new contributors to get involved. Documentation on how to do this is in the process of being merged, but for now, you can read how to use this new feature here: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly/blob/785a35aea84a8081ad946ca01fcadaf9c4e0ee69/docs/contributors/dev_environment_setup.md
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 30 Jul 2021 19:51:14 GMT):<br/>
Note: Because of the switch from ganache-cli to geth, you will likely not be able to run `reset` and then `start` on old stacks created with previous versions of the CLI. If you run into this case, we recommend you simply `remove` the stack and `init` it again.

Could a Hyperledger Besu node also serve as a Ethereum Node?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 30 Jul 2021 19:53:29 GMT):<br/>
Yes! It could, but someone would need to add a flag to the CLI as well as generate the config to wire that up. Shouldn't be too hard to add though.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 30 Jul 2021 19:54:54 GMT):<br/>
If someone who was very familiar with Besu wanted to contribute to FireFly that sounds like it would be a great thing to add :wink:

hi @janrockdev , I must be missing something here, but I can't seem to find the new content you pushed to your repo, as there's no `/test/integration/cli` folder in any of the branches (I found `main` and `first-cut`)
</p>

hi, I did small cosmetic PR and the signoff is expecting unchanged main on my side, so I had to remove it. I will create new branch and share it. I will look to the listed issues instead of making distraction or more issues :D

<p><strong>janrockdev</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 20:59:50 GMT):<br/>
Hi, a question to the ff-cli team:
I'm currently testing my grpc "fastconnect" which is sending 1000 messages/sec to Kafka buffer to be reinserted to Hypeledger via API (:5000/api).
I can see all the messages in the Explorer, also data in Data, however, the main stats not updating at all, or I can see just 100 increments instead of 1000.
The speed is not bad, data are in, just the UI main stats are confusing. Any idea, what could be wrong?
</p>
<p><strong>janrockdev</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 21:00:27 GMT):<br/>

<br/><a href="./assets/AAiC4QwoZG7ZcxCds-Screenshot 2021-08-03 at 21.48.08.png">Screenshot 2021-08-03 at 21.48.08.png</a>
</p>
<p><strong>janrockdev</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 21:01:03 GMT):<br/>
Last messages shows correct status, timestamps etc.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 21:02:37 GMT):<br/>
I think the API does pagination (so that it doesn't have to do a select on the whole table). I'm guessing the UI still needs some work to actually account for many pages of data. @shorsher can you comment on that?
</p>
<p><strong>janrockdev</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 21:05:14 GMT):<br/>
(version latest from this morning build)
</p>
<p><strong>janrockdev</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 21:07:21 GMT):<br/>
The donut chart shows some activity that I believe is correct during the load, just the number inside is not correct.
</p>
<p><strong>janrockdev</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 21:23:30 GMT):<br/>
One more question related to throughput. What could be the best way to get faster insert? I don't want to move back to manual installation of Hyperledger cluster ;)
</p>
<p><strong>shorsher</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 21:30:43 GMT):<br/>
Hi @janrockdev, thanks for pointing this out. Currently, there's no good way to get the total number of anything (messages, etc.) from the API (see https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly/issues/43). So I believe I just picked some arbitrarily high (not high enough :sweat_smile:) pagination limit when trying to get totals for the dashboard.
</p>
<p><strong>shorsher</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 21:31:51 GMT):<br/>
It definitely can be improved, I'll see what I can do this week. If you have any suggestions, I'd love to hear them.
</p>
<p><strong>janrockdev</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 21:33:06 GMT):<br/>
Cool, no worries, it's super useful now - Last messages and preview is all what I need. ;)
</p>
<p><strong>shorsher</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 21:33:21 GMT):<br/>
Paging through the tables for messages, transactions, etc. should allow you to see all of them however.
</p>
<p><strong>janrockdev</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 21:34:05 GMT):<br/>
All works! Except the main top 4 stats and donut stat in the middle.
</p>
<p><strong>shorsher</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 21:36:44 GMT):<br/>
Glad to hear! If you run into any more issues or have suggestions, please feel free to pop them in an issue.
</p>
<p><strong>janrockdev</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 21:37:20 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>janrockdev</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 21:45:00 GMT):<br/>
just on 2 nodes I can insert 1000 100byte messages in 110 seconds. ~9/sec ...how to get to ±50? wsocket connector?
</p>
<p><strong>janrockdev</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 21:47:03 GMT):<br/>
@jimthematrix Will that be a similar challenge for the fabconnect?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 04 Aug 2021 14:58:33 GMT):<br/>
ah got you, the signoff check is a pain for adding additional commits to a PR. what I ended up doing was using a branch in my own fork, and create the PR from there against the main in the official repo. that way you are allowed to add additional commits to an outstanding PR, as long as each commit is properly signed off
</p>
<p><strong>janrockdev</strong> (Wed, 04 Aug 2021 16:29:09 GMT):<br/>
I will do the same next time ;)
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Wed, 04 Aug 2021 20:25:55 GMT):<br/>
@janrockdev I assume the transactions were submitted as async request (`fly-sync=false`)? were you using the `fabconnect` with a Kafka handler or the direct handler for the test run? some of the things to tweak for higher parallelism:
- `maxInFlight`: how many txs can enter the internal queue and be managed
- `sendCurrency`: how may txs can be sent to the Fabric network in parallel

<p><strong>sukrutsathaye</strong> (Tue, 10 Aug 2021 09:08:04 GMT):<br/>
can i change the docker-compose file generated after creating a new stack to suit my specific use-case, i.e using with hyperledger besu?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Tue, 10 Aug 2021 17:35:19 GMT):<br/>
You can definitely edit the docker-compose file after you run `ff init`. If you replace geth with something else, you will have still have some work to do, to get a working stack.

When you run `ff start <stack_name>` the FireFly CLI does a lot of work to get configs ready before startup. This includes creating some docker volumes and copying config files and certs to them. The key part for the ethereum blockchain node is creating an address on chain (in the genesis block) for each member, setting them as signers, and making sure they are unlocked for submitting transactions at runtime.
</p>

Hi all! Starting this week, we are changing our community call to an every-other-week schedule. We will skip this week so there will be *no community call tomorrow*. Our next meeting will be Wednesday 2021-08-18.
</p>
<p><strong>sukrutsathaye</strong> (Wed, 11 Aug 2021 07:48:44 GMT):<br/>
exactly! I am having a hard time unlocking the account after I replace geth image with that of the besu. Although I had replaced all the addresses and keys which geth had with that of besu.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 11 Aug 2021 13:15:12 GMT):<br/>
If you're interested in getting the FireFly CLI to generate a stack with Hyperledger Besu, I'd love to work together on that, or at least help point you in the right direction. It's something we really want to support, but just haven't had the cycles to tackle yet
</p>
<p><strong>sukrutsathaye</strong> (Wed, 11 Aug 2021 15:46:32 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 12 Aug 2021 20:56:50 GMT):<br/>
@sukrutsathaye I just pushed a decently sized refactor to this branch https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly-cli/tree/blockchain-refactor
This creates a generic interface for various blockchain providers and moves all of the `geth` specific code out of the stack logic directly. I stubbed out a `BesuProvider` here: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly-cli/blob/blockchain-refactor/internal/blockchain/ethereum/besu/besuProvider.go It just needs the functions filled out.

There was a lot of code change in this branch, and it's largely untested. I just got it to compile again. Will do some thorough testing tomorrow to make sure I didn't break anything, but wanted to give you a heads up because I think this will be helpful to you when you get to the point of writing the code to automate the Besu setup.
</p>
<p><strong>sukrutsathaye</strong> (Fri, 13 Aug 2021 10:15:39 GMT):<br/>
Thanks a lot for this. I ll start cracking!
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 13 Aug 2021 11:55:41 GMT):<br/>
There are definitely some bugs in the refactor, so I'll push another commit here shortly. Testing now.
</p>
<p><strong>sukrutsathaye</strong> (Fri, 13 Aug 2021 12:10:43 GMT):<br/>
perfect! then I ll pull it once you commit the current changes

</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 13 Aug 2021 12:48:58 GMT):<br/>
I'll still be making a few changes to this branch. Hopefully they won't be too disruptive. I need to work out a different way to do logging now that we have the interface abstraction
</p>
<p><strong>sukrutsathaye</strong> (Fri, 13 Aug 2021 12:51:07 GMT):<br/>
I don't mind, you can continue the way you have planned. I would be a bit slow initially, because I have no experience with go. But I can try to wrap my head around it, and ask you about the code which I don't understand
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 13 Aug 2021 14:53:20 GMT):<br/>
Just pushed another commit that adds a logging interface so the blockchain implementations can log to whichever method the CLI is currently using (stdout or the fancy spinner thingy)
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 13 Aug 2021 19:37:34 GMT):<br/>
@sukrutsathaye and @Andrew.Richardson I just pushed another decent update to that branch. Andrew, this one has your recently merged changes in it as well (though some of that code has moved). There may be a bit more code to shuffle around as I get further into the Fabric implementation (member/identity generation?) but the current code builds, starts a stack, and all the E2E tests pass when run against that stack so I feel like it's shaping up well now

<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Fri, 13 Aug 2021 19:55:24 GMT):<br/>
I opened two small PRs on ethconnect:
- README changes: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly-ethconnect/pull/138
- Allow passing in a request ID instead of being assigned one: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly-ethconnect/pull/139

The latter may help avoid race conditions in the case where the blockchain provider sends events _before_ resolving the HTTP request. If an event comes in before FireFly has resolved and parsed the HTTP response that triggered it, it's impossible to correlate (currently we hold the event for some time and poll to see if the ID becomes known, which is messy). But if we can provide the ID from FireFly, then every event should be recognized no matter whether the HTTP request or the async events come back first.
</p>

<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 16 Aug 2021 16:52:32 GMT):<br/>
Let me check. I know that branch was good before the merge, but that doesn't look right...
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 16 Aug 2021 16:53:10 GMT):<br/>
There's a bug with the external flag. Let me fix that real quick
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Mon, 16 Aug 2021 16:54:57 GMT):<br/>
ok. I also notice that it's trying to use postgres even if I pass sqlite3
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Mon, 16 Aug 2021 16:55:10 GMT):<br/>
maybe related?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 16 Aug 2021 16:55:19 GMT):<br/>
Okay I'll look at that too
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Mon, 16 Aug 2021 16:55:57 GMT):<br/>
but didn't the unit tests pass on the... oh wait 😜
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 16 Aug 2021 16:56:22 GMT):<br/>
That's a known issue https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly-cli/issues/7
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Mon, 16 Aug 2021 16:57:42 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. I think I got [#79](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly-cli/pull/79) rebased onto the latest, just want to test it before I re-upload.
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Mon, 16 Aug 2021 16:58:20 GMT):<br/>
Well, more of a "redo" than a "rebase" since I added token providers alongside the blockchain providers.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 16 Aug 2021 17:26:18 GMT):<br/>
@Andrew.Richardson This should fix those problems https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly-cli/pull/84

https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly-cli/pull/79 is now reworked on top of the latest, and adds basic support for token providers to the CLI.

Hi,
</p>
<p><strong>mona15</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 23:25:06 GMT):<br/>
I have a question regarding ff cli. I have docker and latest golang installed on my mac
</p>
<p><strong>mona15</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 23:25:48 GMT):<br/>
I successfully did go install of github cli, however when I attempt to execute any ff cmd it does not recognize it in terminal
</p>
<p><strong>mona15</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 23:26:40 GMT):<br/>
even weirder was randomly it recognized the ff init command for me to create a stack, however I reopened terminal and now it is again not recognizing the ff command
</p>
<p><strong>mona15</strong> (Thu, 19 Aug 2021 23:26:56 GMT):<br/>
has anyone come across this issue before? I am a total new comer to firefly

Hello everyone, I am new to open source projects and Blockchain... So my questions sound bad but I will ask them anyway. 1) I recently up firefly CLI stack and I am trying to use some API calls... but 127.0.0.1:5000/ui is working but not the /api/v1 am I missing something here? 2) if I want to change the look and feel of the web interface how can change those things? Thanks in advance and sorry for asking very generic questions...hope to engage more with the firefly community :D
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 14:22:06 GMT):<br/>
@KingAlawaka welcome! You should be able view the generated API at http://127.0.0.1:5000/api. The web interface is provided by the UI project at https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly-ui - if you want to play around with it, you can clone and run another instance of the UI and point it toward your backend by modifying the UI's proxy port here: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly-ui/blob/9168e9cb8501461666d5f99a4e39322281ab553f/package.json#L70

<p><strong>sukrutsathaye</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 13:18:43 GMT):<br/>
I  noticed that when I restart the stacks after a system restart, the ui and api urls aren't reachable until I reset the stack. This happened two times now. And I think I hadn't stopped the stacks while shutting down the computer. Maybe someone can also try it out and check
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 13:19:25 GMT):<br/>
Hmm is this with Besu only or any configuration?
</p>
<p><strong>sukrutsathaye</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 13:19:43 GMT):<br/>
no with geth
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 13:20:10 GMT):<br/>
Okay that sounds like a problem. Do you see the same behavior if you `ff stop` and then `ff start` the same stack without rebooting?
</p>
<p><strong>sukrutsathaye</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 13:21:18 GMT):<br/>
I never tested it without rebooting. I ll test it now and get back to you
</p>
<p><strong>sukrutsathaye</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 13:22:15 GMT):<br/>
I did however try stopping and starting stacks again after rebooting, but same issue, unless I reset
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 13:22:38 GMT):<br/>
Okay. I'll try to reproduce that here in a few minutes too
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 13:22:59 GMT):<br/>
That's definitely not the expected behavior
</p>
<p><strong>sukrutsathaye</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 13:23:03 GMT):<br/>
so The same behavior is observed after stopping and starting again
</p>
<p><strong>sukrutsathaye</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 13:23:14 GMT):<br/>
I just checked
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 13:23:29 GMT):<br/>
Interesting. Well at least it's consistent :)
</p>
<p><strong>sukrutsathaye</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 13:23:47 GMT):<br/>
hahaha yeah, could be easier to debug
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 13:23:59 GMT):<br/>
I'll look into it. Thanks for reporting it
</p>
<p><strong>sukrutsathaye</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 13:24:21 GMT):<br/>
my pleasure! :)
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 14:17:14 GMT):<br/>
@sukrutsathaye I've repro'd the issue you reported with stopping and starting a stack. Looks like the new tokens connector is not coming up cleanly the second time.

<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 12:02:53 GMT):<br/>
Good morning! The FireFly CLI was updated to v0.0.30 last night, which fixes an issue reported above regarding restarting a stack. The CLI can be upgraded by running `go install github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly-cli/ff@latest`
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 12:04:19 GMT):<br/>
Also, just a reminder, we have a Developer Workshop starting in about 25 minutes. It's a great chance to get together and get a local development environment set up to start building apps on FireFly or contributing to the FireFly codebase itself. Details are here: https://www.meetup.com/Hyperledger-Bangalore/events/280318418 Hope to see a lot of you there!

Sorry for missing the past few community calls, I have a work meeting at that time now.  Has there been any discussion of raising the incubation discussion on the TSC call? I think the two biggest concerns (fabric smart client overlap and time as open source) have been resolved from my perspective.  Interested to hear the maintainers take.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Tue, 14 Sep 2021 16:56:47 GMT):<br/>
No worries! Good question. It hasn't come up in detailed discussion, but we are actually planning on talking about it a bit in tomorrow's call (I'm about to send out the agenda for that).

HI every one!
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 13:09:46 GMT):<br/>
I was working with firefly the last week and I need some guidance, where can I look to know how to add new nodes to an existent network? Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 14:18:09 GMT):<br/>
Hi @OscarTBallester welcome! :wave:
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 14:20:27 GMT):<br/>
You can register a node with the network by posting to the `/network/register/node/organization/` endpoint. You can see the code in the FireFly CLI that does this here: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly-cli/blob/main/internal/stacks/firefly_identity.go#L27
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 14:51:35 GMT):<br/>
Actually, that URL is for registering the Org. To add a node to the org the URL is `/network/register/node`
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 15:03:42 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for your answer, I saw that endpoint but appears as deprecated and with no info about payload, I mean in the API Spec
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 15:04:02 GMT):<br/>
So what payload I should use?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 17 Sep 2021 21:37:21 GMT):<br/>
Good question. I didn't realize that one was deprecated now. Let me get back to you on that in a bit
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 11:11:14 GMT):<br/>
Ok, thanks. We are very interested in Firefly and the register node endpoint is a key feature for us.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 13:18:37 GMT):<br/>
Okay. I had a chance to test this. The new API endpoints are very similar. There is a new query parameter that you can include `?confirm=true` which will cause the HTTP request to block until registration succeeds, so you don't have to write polling code either.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 13:19:19 GMT):<br/>
So to register the org, `POST` to `network/organizations/self`. Then to register the node, `POST` to `network/nodes/self`
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 13:20:34 GMT):<br/>
Ok, so I need to call this endpoint from another node, isn't it?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 13:27:15 GMT):<br/>
Something just needs to call this endpoint after the node starts up, to tell the node that it should register itself
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 13:27:46 GMT):<br/>
It doesn't need to be another FireFly node. It could be curl, postman, or your own custom app
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 13:29:35 GMT):<br/>
I mean, if I have a network working and I want to add a new node, how can I do it?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 13:46:58 GMT):<br/>
You just have to run the node, and post to that endpoint. If the node belongs to an org that is already registered, you can skip the call to `/network/organizations/self` when adding the new node
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 13:54:12 GMT):<br/>
So the node should be in the same eth network? Or how the node knows into which network should register itself?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 14:12:01 GMT):<br/>
The FireFly config file should have a `blockchain` section defined which allows it to connect to the same blockchain that the rest of the FireFly nodes in the network are connected to. This is what allows the new node to broadcast its presence to the other nodes, through a blockchain event
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 14:15:07 GMT):<br/>
Ah! Ok thanks, so where is this file located?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 14:24:22 GMT):<br/>
It can be anywhere on the filesystem. To point to the config file, use the `-f <config_file_path>` flag on the command line to start FireFly. If the path is not specified on the command line, FireFly will look for a yaml file named `firefly.core` in `/etc/firefly/` or `$HOME/.firefly`
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 14:24:54 GMT):<br/>
Ok, thank you so much!

Hi again, I read about a strong member governance in Firefly but I can't find any info about that in the API spec, can you say me how it works? Thank you again!
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 17:59:58 GMT):<br/>
Hi Oscar. This is an area that is being very actively worked on right now. There are quite a few details in https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly/issues/187
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 18:02:43 GMT):<br/>
Ok, thank you. I thought it was available now because I read about it as a current feature in the Firefly webpage.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 18:04:08 GMT):<br/>
Which page are you looking at? Maybe I can elaborate a bit more on that
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 18:04:37 GMT):<br/>
https://www.kaleido.io/hyperledger-firefly
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 18:06:17 GMT):<br/>
There is some features marked as "Coming soon" but Member Governance is there as a current feature.
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 18:07:11 GMT):<br/>
But I mean is ok, it is interesting for us but we can do it at the application level.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 18:07:39 GMT):<br/>
Ah yeah. The short answer is, there are some things that page talks about that are still under development.
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 18:09:19 GMT):<br/>
So, maybe the API spec is a better information source, right?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 20 Sep 2021 18:10:33 GMT):<br/>
Yes. Things on GitHub or the docs site (https://labs.hyperledger.org/firefly/)(which is automatically built from source on merge to `main`) are the most accurate and up to date

<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 15:13:29 GMT):<br/>
Hi Nicko, 

I was testing with data_types and data and I have a couple of questions:
- POST to namespace/default/data, I have a data_type called company and I want to create a company and then "modify it", I know we cannot edit the data itself but I'm trying to use de dataid to send again the info with changes but this creates another different id so I lost the trace. 
- POST to namespace/default/data, the system checks if the data_type is defined but is not checking yet if the attributes are correct, right?

Thanks again and sorry, I'm working on an mvp and I really want to push forward with Firefly.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 20:50:07 GMT):<br/>
Hey sorry just saw this
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 20:54:31 GMT):<br/>
There is no way to update or modify uploaded data without assigning it a new ID. If there was, this would allow someone to "rewrite history". If this data was pinned to the blockchain, you can't change what the blockchain points to.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 20:54:58 GMT):<br/>
If you could describe your use case a bit more, perhaps I could guide you to a pattern that does work in firefly.
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 21:01:18 GMT):<br/>
It is just what I said, we have some companies and I want to have the possibility to update some data
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 21:01:37 GMT):<br/>
Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 21:05:02 GMT):<br/>
On your second question, if the data is JSON and you have defined a custom data type, FireFly will validate that the required fields are present when you upload the data
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 21:06:12 GMT):<br/>
I defined a datatype company with the fields we need and I sent it using the data endpoint. Maybe there is a better way to do it.
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 21:06:33 GMT):<br/>
I'm talking about first question
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 21:20:49 GMT):<br/>
Makes sense. You probably also want to define another datatype that is something like `CompanyUpdateEvent` which is what you would send any time you want to update the existing company record.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 21:21:39 GMT):<br/>
If each message related to a specific company is sent using the same `topic`, they will be ordered, and you can also query the messages on that topic via the API to see the update history
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 21:22:45 GMT):<br/>
aaaaa ok
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 21:22:52 GMT):<br/>
Thank you so much
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 21:23:01 GMT):<br/>
That's a good point
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 21:26:05 GMT):<br/>
Which endpoint I should use?
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 21:33:18 GMT):<br/>
Ok, I think I got it, I need to post the type and then broadcast with the topic, and ask the message by topic, I'm right?
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 21:34:52 GMT):<br/>
post data between type and message, between typew and message posting*
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Tue, 21 Sep 2021 21:34:52 GMT):<br/>
post data between type and message posting*

<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 12:39:13 GMT):<br/>
Yes that's exactly right
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 12:40:45 GMT):<br/>
You _could_ also just put the data inline in your message when you POST to `messages/broadcast`. This would be a simpler flow. But what you described would allow a bit more flexibility if you wanted to send the same data item again in another message later for example
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 12:42:08 GMT):<br/>
Yes, but I need the id to set the reference.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 12:42:25 GMT):<br/>
Welcome @scaraclette  :wave:
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 12:42:40 GMT):<br/>
Thank you so much, it was really helpful.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 12:43:39 GMT):<br/>
Yes, if you want to give the _data itself_ (separate of them message it was sent in) a unique ID in the system, this is when it makes sense to post the data ahead of time, and then attach it to a message after
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 12:44:53 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I'm working on that way now.
</p>

Hi, @nguyer thank you for the welcome! I'm Scarlett and currently a rising senior CS student.
I'm here because I'm hoping Firefly can be my first open source contribution since it's still early on in development, has great documentation, and what I think the project is trying to achieve is super awesome. Right now, I'm just going through the YouTube videos for demos and will be testing out local development. 
I have experience in TypeScript from past internships and am currently learning Golang (used Rust in a previous internship, and so far I love how straight forward Go looks). Definitely interested in joining the next meetup whenever it happens.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 15:05:56 GMT):<br/>
Awesome! So glad you're here! I'd be happy to help you get started contributing. Let me know how I can help!
</p>
<p><strong>scaraclette</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 15:13:24 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, I'm planning to run things locally to test out dev environment today. If something looks confusing, will go through chat to see if anyone had a similar issue, and/or create a new thread for dev setup :pray:
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 15:45:45 GMT):<br/>
Sounds good!
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 20:26:10 GMT):<br/>
Hi again!

The update system works like a charm, I just need some help uploading big files from PHP... any example? Thanks again Nicko!
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 20:28:18 GMT):<br/>
Great! Hmm I haven't written anything in PHP in the better part of a decade now... I don't have any examples readily available of uploading a file using PHP, but I'm sure Google could turn up some examples
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 20:41:11 GMT):<br/>
But I mean, which fields are waiting for the endpoint? I know is the data endpoint but where I should put the file value?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 20:50:13 GMT):<br/>
FireFly uses a standard multi-part form post to upload a file to the data endpoint
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 20:50:37 GMT):<br/>
There's an example of how to do it using `curl` here: https://labs.hyperledger.org/firefly/gettingstarted/private_send.html#multipart-form-post-of-a-file
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 20:53:47 GMT):<br/>
I tried to replicate this example in PHP but it returns {"error":"FF10130: Invalid content type"} ... I keep it trying, thank you
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 21:08:29 GMT):<br/>
Okay sounds good. If you do suspect there's an issue with FireFly feel free to post here in RocketChat or open an issue on GitHub. I suspect it's just the way the client code is doing the upload though. I haven't heard of any issues with uploading to the /data endpoint
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 17:41:43 GMT):<br/>
I'm trying with postman but gives me this error: "error": "FF10116: Database insert failed: NOT NULL constraint failed: data.value".
I'm using: form-data, adding a file with "file" as a key, and the auto-generated headers. What I'm doing wrong? Thanks again!
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 18:01:55 GMT):<br/>
Are you able to send me the postman request that you're using so I can try?

np
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 19:30:50 GMT):<br/>
Let me try this
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 19:37:49 GMT):<br/>
Thank!
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 19:39:20 GMT):<br/>
Try adding another field on your multi-part form called `autometa` with a value of `true`
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 19:39:20 GMT):<br/>
Try adding another field on your multi-part form called `autometa` with a value of `true` and make it the first field in the form (before `file`)
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 19:39:43 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 19:41:47 GMT):<br/>
"error": "FF10218: Error reading multi-part form input: EOF"

Hmm that worked for me in postman
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 19:43:24 GMT):<br/>
Oh, I don't know....
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 19:43:45 GMT):<br/>
Did you try it with Postman too and you got that error?
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 19:43:58 GMT):<br/>
yup
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 19:45:23 GMT):<br/>
Hmm. I'm using the same exact postman request you sent me, except I added autometa: true before the file, and I selected a different file on my disk
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 19:45:43 GMT):<br/>
Have you tried a different file?
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 19:46:14 GMT):<br/>
I changed the file and worked
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 19:46:35 GMT):<br/>
thank you
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 19:48:30 GMT):<br/>
Perfect!
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 19:48:52 GMT):<br/>
Can I add a datatype to this?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 19:49:55 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 19:50:35 GMT):<br/>
I can do it posting another data linked with the file ID maybe
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 19:54:32 GMT):<br/>
There's a way to do it in the same request... it's not in the docs yet though :( hold on...
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 20:02:36 GMT):<br/>
Okay, so there is actually an open issue around this. I think Peter is planning on tackling this one in the next day or two: https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/issues/198
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 20:03:32 GMT):<br/>
Ok, I'll check it
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 20:03:52 GMT):<br/>
And any clues about how get the file from Firefly?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 20:07:38 GMT):<br/>
Sure, if you want to download the original file again, you can do a GET to localhost:5000/api/v1/namespaces/default/data/{dataId}/blob
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 23 Sep 2021 20:07:38 GMT):<br/>

So based on the contributor workshop, I managed to follow it and have done the following steps (putting it here in case it might be useful for others in the future):
1. Fork repository
2. Clone forked
3. Run `make`
4. Run `go install`
5. Create a new stack with the command `ff init --external 1`. Choose the name and number of nodes. For example, use the name `dev_1` as stack name and 2 number of nodes.
6. Start stack within repo folder. `ff start dev_1`
7. Set environment variable in `launch.json` to point to that debug stack. By default it's pointed to `${env:HOME}/.firefly/stacks/dev/configs/firefly_core_0.yml`, change the `stacks/dev` to the new debug stack name `stacks/dev_1`
8. Create config file and place it in...? 
So, everything looks good but it's asking for a `firefly.core` config file. I'm assuming we create the config file based on an example seen in the test/data/config folder https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/blob/main/test/data/config/firefly.core.yaml. If that's the case, where is the best place to put the config? 
If I did `go install` it'll move it to my GOPATH, so I wasn't sure where to put the config file.
Right now, the error when running Core Firefly is:
FF10101: Failed to read config: Config File "firefly.core" Not Found in "[/etc/firefly /Users/scarlett/.firefly /Users/scarlett/Desktop/open_source/project_firefly/firefly]"

**[UPDATE: revised and completed steps]**
Got a bit confused understanding how a config file was pointed, it turns out we're suppose to run Firefly to point to the generated config file from CLI.
Steps:
1. Fork repository
2. Clone forked
3. Run `make`
4. Run `go install`
5. Create a new stack with the command `ff init --external 1`. Choose the name and number of nodes. For example, use the name `dev_1` as stack name and 2 number of nodes.
6. Run `ff start dev_1`, wait until the stack starts, and copy-paste  config location when running Firefly core. Example message `please start your firefly core with the config file for this stack: firefly -f /Users/scarlett/.firefly`
7. Within repo directory, run: `firefly -f /Users/scarlett/.firefly`
8. [For VSCode, to enable debugger]: Change `launch.json` file to point out to stack.

Looks like you're doing great!
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 24 Sep 2021 18:19:04 GMT):<br/>
So if you ran `ff init -e 1 ...` the CLI should have generated the config file for you
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 24 Sep 2021 18:19:29 GMT):<br/>
When you run `ff start ...` it will pause at the point where you need to run FireFly on your host machine
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 24 Sep 2021 18:19:50 GMT):<br/>
The CLI will also print out the command you should run, including the path to the config file
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 24 Sep 2021 18:20:27 GMT):<br/>
If you're using VS Code, I would recommend using the launch configuration that's in the repo, as it's already set up to point to a config file for a stack called `dev`

Ah okay, I forgot about the part where the config file was generated after doing `ff start <dev_stack_name`. Going to edit the steps I wrote here and try running the CLI to generate the config file. Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 24 Sep 2021 18:24:54 GMT):<br/>
The config file should be generated with `ff init`
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 24 Sep 2021 18:25:10 GMT):<br/>
But the CLI will tell you the command to run as part of `ff start`
</p>
<p><strong>scaraclette</strong> (Fri, 24 Sep 2021 18:25:23 GMT):<br/>
So I should run ff init within the terminal for the repo right? I did it outside of my vscode terminal
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 24 Sep 2021 18:26:01 GMT):<br/>
You can run `ff init/start` in any working directory
</p>
<p><strong>scaraclette</strong> (Fri, 24 Sep 2021 18:43:54 GMT):<br/>
Awesome, it works! Going to update the steps I wrote
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Fri, 24 Sep 2021 18:48:16 GMT):<br/>
Great!

Hi all, please, any comments on https://github.com/softwaremill/fablo ? They are presenting themselves with Hyperledger too and it looks similar to Firefly! Grrrrr...lets hack them! :woo:
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 15:51:30 GMT):<br/>
I hadn't seen Fablo before. I just took a quick look at it. It looks like a tool to help speed up fabric network creation. That's very different than what FireFly has been designed to do. I'm assuming your call to "hack them" is a joke (which is hard to convey over chat), but let's try to keep the conversation positive. Even if they are trying to do the same thing, there is room in the world for more than one open source project. And more projects mean more opportunities for collaboration.

Hi Team
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:37:25 GMT):<br/>
I am trying to setup firefly to interact with my fabric network
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:37:34 GMT):<br/>
somehow i managed to run fabconnect
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:37:43 GMT):<br/>
but not sure how to take it forward
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:37:59 GMT):<br/>
how do I inititate a transaction
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:38:17 GMT):<br/>
or how to connect fabconnect to my my fabric network which is running
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:38:51 GMT):<br/>
Is there any video available which tells setup by step how to integrate firefly with fabirc?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:42:11 GMT):<br/>
Hi @upmagupta! :wave:
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:42:57 GMT):<br/>
Fabric support has not quite been merged into the main branch yet but it should be fairly soon
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:43:25 GMT):<br/>
thanks nguyer for your response
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:44:21 GMT):<br/>
actually I am doing a POC on it is it possible that with the existing code we have we can integrate fabric and try basic transactions?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:45:22 GMT):<br/>
I'll start a thread for this one... So it sounds like you already have a POC on FireFly? And you'd like to switch FireFly to use Fabric now?
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:46:31 GMT):<br/>
yaa i did my POC on ethereum but my company wants to explore fabric too as we are trying to build a solution using fabric
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:46:42 GMT):<br/>
so I was trying to do a POC on the same
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:47:28 GMT):<br/>
I see. It _is_ possible to try it today on your own machine, but you'll need to checkout some specific feature branches and build the docker images for those locally.
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:47:29 GMT):<br/>
if i can try what all will be possible with firefly when it comes to fabric then i will be able to look for options if we can use the same for our use case
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:48:03 GMT):<br/>
yaa i can do all of what is required but the problem is i dont know how to do it
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:50:29 GMT):<br/>
Okay. I can try to walk you through it
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:50:41 GMT):<br/>
so do we have anything which i can use to setup and integrate my firefly with fabric
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:50:50 GMT):<br/>
that will be awesome
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:50:53 GMT):<br/>
thanks a lot
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:51:05 GMT):<br/>
so how do we do it ?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:51:58 GMT):<br/>
Do you already have the FireFly CLI set up, and have you been able to create an environment yet?
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:52:11 GMT):<br/>
yes i have firefly setup
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:52:22 GMT):<br/>
Great.
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:52:33 GMT):<br/>
and my fabric network indiviadually is also running . i have setup fabconnect also but not sure if i have done coreectly
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:52:33 GMT):<br/>
Clone this fork/branch: https://github.com/kaleido-io/firefly/tree/fabric-plugin
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:53:20 GMT):<br/>
In that directory run `docker build -t ghcr.io/hyperledger/firefly .`
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:53:46 GMT):<br/>
okay this is the first step to start from
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:53:47 GMT):<br/>
?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:54:12 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:54:27 GMT):<br/>
okay sure ihave set it up in my ec2 machine
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:54:44 GMT):<br/>
(note, you must be on the `fabric-plugin` branch when you run `docker build`
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:55:01 GMT):<br/>
okay
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:55:25 GMT):<br/>
So that will give you a version of FireFly that has a plugin to work with fabric. The next thing you need is the version of the CLI that can set up the fabric network. To do that, checkout the `fabric` branch of the CLI: https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-cli/tree/fabric
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:55:48 GMT):<br/>
From that directory run `make install` to build and install that version of the CLI
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:56:27 GMT):<br/>
Then you should be able to run `ff init --blockchain-provider fabric` to create the config for the new FireFly stack
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:57:06 GMT):<br/>
Finally, start up the stack with `ff start <stack_name> --no-pull` The `--no-pull` flag is important to tell the CLI not to overwrite the docker image you just built in the previous steps
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:11:30 GMT):<br/>
hi nguyer
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:11:35 GMT):<br/>
i just got an error stating

after i ran f init --blockchain-provider fabric
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:12:03 GMT):<br/>
That means you're not running the correct build of the CLI
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:12:05 GMT):<br/>
ff init command
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:12:12 GMT):<br/>
ohh
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:12:19 GMT):<br/>
Did you build and install from source on the `fabric` branch of the CLI?
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:12:25 GMT):<br/>
i am inside the ff cli folder

this is the path
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:14:36 GMT):<br/>
and inside firefly-cli i ran make build and then ff init

ohh okay
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:16:06 GMT):<br/>
You need to be on the `fabric` branch
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:16:10 GMT):<br/>
`git checkout fabric`
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:16:16 GMT):<br/>
which branch i need to be on
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:16:21 GMT):<br/>
okay
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:16:49 GMT):<br/>
Please also make sure that you were on the `fabric-plugin` branch when you built the docker image for firefly (the first step I listed above)
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:17:21 GMT):<br/>
ohh
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:17:29 GMT):<br/>
i didnt take care of the branch thing
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:17:38 GMT):<br/>
i just repeat the above steps
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:17:53 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that's why I pointed out at the beginning that none of this has been merged into the main branch yet

ohh sorry i missed that

hi nguyer
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:32:34 GMT):<br/>
it worked thanks
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:32:44 GMT):<br/>
now i have firefly for ethereum running on 3000 ports
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:32:54 GMT):<br/>
and this will be fabric
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:33:01 GMT):<br/>
and 5000 is already accupied
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:33:03 GMT):<br/>
occupied
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:33:35 GMT):<br/>
so i should be running
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:34:08 GMT):<br/>
ff ff init --blockchain-provider fabric 4000 -s 4100
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:34:10 GMT):<br/>
?
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:38:00 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:39:14 GMT):<br/>
You can't currently run more than one FireFly stack on your local machine at the same time
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:39:33 GMT):<br/>
ohh so i need to delete the ethereum one first ?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:39:35 GMT):<br/>
You should run `ff stop <stack_name>` to stop the currently running stack before starting the new one
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:39:43 GMT):<br/>
ohh okay thanks
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:39:45 GMT):<br/>
You don't have to remove it completely. You just need to stop it
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:39:50 GMT):<br/>
okay thanks
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 17:40:05 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:03:36 GMT):<br/>
Ah okay. Many of these repos moved in the last couple of days so some of these branches may need to be updated. I think you can work around this issue by running `docker build -t ghcr.io/hyperledger-labs/firefly-fabconnect .` in the fabconnect directory
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:04:14 GMT):<br/>
you mean switch to fabconnect branch n then run docker build ?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:04:52 GMT):<br/>
No branch switching should be neccesary
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:05:09 GMT):<br/>
But in the firefly-fabconnect directory, you need to tag the docker build with a different name
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:05:48 GMT):<br/>
ohh git it used labs

<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:06:19 GMT):<br/>
All of the main branches have been updated but some of these feature branches are still in progress
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:06:45 GMT):<br/>
sure thanks a lot helping me like this
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:06:46 GMT):<br/>
:)
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:09:46 GMT):<br/>
one more thing i dont have create my network and then connect fabconnect to it
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:09:59 GMT):<br/>
it will bring up the fabric network too right ?
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:16:35 GMT):<br/>
also i am getting the error
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:16:36 GMT):<br/>
Failed [1] Error: No such container:path: firefly_fabric_firefly_core_0_1:/firefly/contracts/firefly_fabric.tar.gz
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:17:08 GMT):<br/>
i have  firefly_fabric.tar.gz in my cli
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:17:14 GMT):<br/>
should i copy that there ?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:17:49 GMT):<br/>
I suspect that means you aren't running the correct branch of `firefly` which has the fabric chaincode in it
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:18:16 GMT):<br/>
What branch are you on in the `firefly` repo when you built that docker image?
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:19:08 GMT):<br/>
fabric-plugin
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:19:54 GMT):<br/>
Hmm okay. If that's true I'm not sure what else would cause that
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:20:00 GMT):<br/>
oh
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:20:24 GMT):<br/>
should i paste tar file under my contract n try ?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:20:55 GMT):<br/>
You can certainly try. I'm not sure what tar file you actually have there or where it would have come from
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:21:13 GMT):<br/>
its lokking for  firefly_fabric.tar.gz
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:21:23 GMT):<br/>
which is not there in my contract folder
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:21:31 GMT):<br/>
but its under my cli folder
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:21:50 GMT):<br/>
Right. The CLI is trying to extract a packaged chaincode from the FireFly docker container
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:22:24 GMT):<br/>
And it can't find it. Which usually means the image that is running is not the correct version
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:22:35 GMT):<br/>
ohh
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:23:14 GMT):<br/>
so should i remove the firefly folder n create it again n build image in pkugin repo
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:23:15 GMT):<br/>
?
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:23:23 GMT):<br/>
plugin*
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:24:40 GMT):<br/>
Possibly. If you want to try it again, you can run `ff remove <stack_name>` then run `ff init ...` again to recreate everything
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 18:24:54 GMT):<br/>
ok thanks let me try that
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 19:09:09 GMT):<br/>
whats the difference between firefly folder
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 19:09:14 GMT):<br/>
and .firefly folder?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 19:45:28 GMT):<br/>
`~.firefly` is a directory where the FireFly CLI stores data. I'm guessing the other directory is probably where you cloned the `firefly` repo with git
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 19:45:28 GMT):<br/>
`~/.firefly` is a directory where the FireFly CLI stores data. I'm guessing the other directory is probably where you cloned the `firefly` repo with git
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 19:45:43 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 19:45:50 GMT):<br/>
i am still getting the same error
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 19:45:57 GMT):<br/>
after doing all the steps again
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 19:46:17 GMT):<br/>
but i am trying to cpoty the tar file in contract folder from cli and will try that
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 19:46:43 GMT):<br/>
Okay. Sorry I can't help anymore at this point. My dev machine is in the middle of working on another branch right now. The change I'm working on is a prerequisite to be able to merge the fabric branches
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 19:47:11 GMT):<br/>
sure no problem i will try to resolve this error
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 19:47:15 GMT):<br/>
and check with you thanks
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 19:47:18 GMT):<br/>
later
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 19:47:56 GMT):<br/>
Sounds good. As soon as I get these changes done, I'll be working on incorporating them to the fabric branches, so if there's something not working there today, I'll have it working very soon
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 19:48:10 GMT):<br/>
great
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 19:52:56 GMT):<br/>
this path only has some issues
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 19:52:56 GMT):<br/>
Error: docker cp firefly_fabric2_firefly_core_0_1:/firefly/contracts/firefly_fabric.tar.gz /home/ec2-user/.firefly/stacks/firefly_fabric2/contracts/firefly_fabric.tar.gz
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 19:53:05 GMT):<br/>
anyways will try again tomorrow
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 19:53:14 GMT):<br/>
thanks for all the help

Hello everyone! That's right, it's official! FireFly has moved out of Labs and is now an official Hyperledger Project.

This will mean a few logistical things will change with mailing lists and stuff like that. We'll talk through some details on tomorrow's call. Here are the details for tomorrow's call:

Wednesday, September 29, 2021 8:00 AM PT
Join link: https://zoom.us/j/6223336701?pwd=dkJKdHRlc3dNZEdKR1JYdW40R2pDUT09

Tomorrow's Agenda:

    - What's changing now that FireFly is an official project?
    - Open discussion
    - Architecture: update on Identity in FireFly

As always, thank you all for your participation in these calls! We hope to see you there!
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Tue, 28 Sep 2021 19:33:41 GMT):<br/>
Also, if you haven't seen it, here's the official blog post with the announcement. Please feel free to share! https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2021/09/28/introducing-hyperledger-firefly-a-multi-party-system-for-enterprise-data-flows
</p>
<p><strong>scaraclette</strong> (Tue, 28 Sep 2021 19:34:27 GMT):<br/>
Will the session be recorded?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Tue, 28 Sep 2021 19:34:43 GMT):<br/>
Yes it will! All the calls are public and recorded
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Tue, 28 Sep 2021 19:35:13 GMT):<br/>
The recordings are posted to the wiki afterward. Although the link to this page will be moving as a part of the transition out of Labs
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Tue, 28 Sep 2021 19:35:20 GMT):<br/>
I'll like the new page after it moves
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Tue, 28 Sep 2021 19:35:20 GMT):<br/>

Hi Nicko, 
I have the MVP almost ready, but I need some more help to add a node. I was trying to create another stack, modify some data from .firefly/stacks/project/configs/firefly_core_0.yml and then start the stack for the first time but I´m giving a timeout error. What I have are two computers, the main one with the Firefly ports open and the other one with the stack config modified. Can you confirm for me if the URL selected is the good one? Do you have any examples? Thanks again!
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Wed, 29 Sep 2021 11:18:43 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Wed, 29 Sep 2021 11:21:21 GMT):<br/>
I mean, if the URL selected is the one I need to change.
I'm looking for this element in the Docker Dashboard and redirecting the node from the second computer to the real port in my main computer.

Hi @chakshujain :wave: welcome!
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 29 Sep 2021 17:01:51 GMT):<br/>
Hi Oscar, that config file was generated for running FireFly inside a docker compose network that has all of the other microservices that FireFly depends on also running inside the same docker compose network. If you want to run FireFly on separate machines, outside of docker compose, it's definitely possible, but you will need to configure each application to know about the real IP address/port that it should be connecting to. It is possible, but there would be a lot of things to change.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 29 Sep 2021 17:38:13 GMT):<br/>
Today's community call recording and slides are up here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/FIR/2021-09-29+FireFly+Community+Call
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Thu, 30 Sep 2021 11:33:49 GMT):<br/>
So, this config file has the right structure to deploy on production? Do you have any documentation about production deploy process? Where should be the config file on prod? Thanks again.
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Thu, 30 Sep 2021 11:41:18 GMT):<br/>
What tokens and dataexchanges URLs mean?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 30 Sep 2021 13:29:34 GMT):<br/>
The config files generated by the CLI are not intended to be deployed to production as-is. They're designed for setting up a minimum viable local development environment
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 30 Sep 2021 13:30:02 GMT):<br/>
Those are the URLs for the token connector and the data exchange - two of the microservices used by FireFly
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Thu, 30 Sep 2021 13:53:46 GMT):<br/>
Ok, so where I can set those URLs in production environment?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 30 Sep 2021 13:55:21 GMT):<br/>
They are set in the FireFLy core config yaml file (just like the one you posted the screenshot of, above)
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 30 Sep 2021 13:55:44 GMT):<br/>
The URL should point to the IP/port of wherever you are running those services
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 30 Sep 2021 13:55:44 GMT):<br/>
The URLs should point to the IP/port of wherever you are running those services
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Thu, 30 Sep 2021 13:57:05 GMT):<br/>
Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Thu, 30 Sep 2021 14:00:01 GMT):<br/>
So, there is a command to run the firefly node or just like a regular GO project?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 30 Sep 2021 14:00:42 GMT):<br/>
In the firefly project directory, you can run `make install`. Then you just need to run `firefly` to run it as a normal process on your machine
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 30 Sep 2021 14:01:10 GMT):<br/>
If you run `firefly --help` it will print out the other command line flags that you can pass to it, such as the path to the config file
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Thu, 30 Sep 2021 14:01:18 GMT):<br/>
Ok, thank you
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Fri, 01 Oct 2021 12:13:39 GMT):<br/>
Hi Nicko, it was really helpful your guidance. I'm getting this error now "FF10105: Failed to initialize TLS configuration: crypto/x509: system root pool is not available on Windows", any ideas?
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Fri, 01 Oct 2021 14:39:00 GMT):<br/>
For anyone that doesn't follow every single FF issue, wanted to point out that we do have an overall tracking issue for tokens now: https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/issues/218
Hopefully this gives better visibility on where it's at and a place to jump in as the conversation evolves. Basic mint/burn/transfer are nearly ready for use!
</p>

hi @nguyer
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Tue, 05 Oct 2021 12:24:52 GMT):<br/>
have you merged the code to main branch ?
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Tue, 05 Oct 2021 12:36:11 GMT):<br/>
hi team
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Tue, 05 Oct 2021 12:36:23 GMT):<br/>
i am getting error while starting my firefly for fabric
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Tue, 05 Oct 2021 12:36:24 GMT):<br/>
ocker cp abf_fabric_firefly_firefly_core_0_1:/firefly/contracts/firefly_fabric.tar.gz /home/ec2-user/.firefly/stacks/abf_fabric_firefly/contracts/firefly_fabric.tar.gz
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Tue, 05 Oct 2021 12:36:44 GMT):<br/>
is firefly_fabric.tar.gz contract tar file to be deployed?
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Tue, 05 Oct 2021 12:36:56 GMT):<br/>
is it the chaincode?
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Tue, 05 Oct 2021 12:39:10 GMT):<br/>
can we put oue own custom chaincode here and oput it
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Tue, 05 Oct 2021 13:04:46 GMT):<br/>
@upmagupta I haven't run with Fabric, but I believe that file should be present in the FireFly Docker image (it's a provided chaincode file for FireFly, and you do not need to provide your own)
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Tue, 05 Oct 2021 13:05:16 GMT):<br/>
but the volume is not created
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Tue, 05 Oct 2021 13:05:16 GMT):<br/>
AFAIK all the Fabric work is still on branches, so you likely need to build your own FireFly Docker from the appropriate Fabric branch (I don't know if there is one published). @nguyer would know more.
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Tue, 05 Oct 2021 13:05:42 GMT):<br/>
okay thanks Andrew will wait for nguyer
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 12:16:25 GMT):<br/>
hi @nguyer good morning
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 12:16:31 GMT):<br/>
we need your help
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 12:16:38 GMT):<br/>
are you there ?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 13:37:51 GMT):<br/>
Hi @upmagupta. Andrew is correct. Fabric feature branches have not been merged yet. There is another large pull request that changes how identities are handled that needs to be merged first. Then the fabric feature branches need to be updated with these changes merged back into them.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 13:38:44 GMT):<br/>
Hey, sorry just got back from travelling, so catching back up on messages. Are you using WSL on Windows?
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 13:38:55 GMT):<br/>
actually we are working on a POC related to firefly integration with fabric if the code is somehow complete is it possible to get it to demoable stage ?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 13:41:09 GMT):<br/>
Yes, we're working on getting the branches merged
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 13:41:25 GMT):<br/>
actually we dont have much time to close on our demo
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 13:41:46 GMT):<br/>
so can you guide me now on how to take it to demo stage
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 13:41:52 GMT):<br/>
?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 13:46:50 GMT):<br/>
I don't think it's possible to run FireFly with Fabric at this exact moment because of all the changes we are in the middle of right now.
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 13:48:19 GMT):<br/>
ohh okay any timeline you have ?
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 13:48:47 GMT):<br/>
also did you guys remove the support for fabconnect and introduced smart-client ?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 13:49:54 GMT):<br/>
As soon as possible :) We are working getting both fabric and tokens branches updated with the identity changes. Fabconnect is still the way to use Fabric with FireFly.
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 13:51:01 GMT):<br/>
any tentative time like in few weeks or months ?
</p>
<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 13:52:42 GMT):<br/>
also why do we have fabric-smart-client with a link not pointing to the reop and also the fabcoonect links are removed
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 13:53:47 GMT):<br/>
I would expect days, rather than weeks or months.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 13:54:03 GMT):<br/>
Where are you seeing those links?

<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 13:59:17 GMT):<br/>
but initially in labs repo it was actually fabconnect

<p><strong>upmagupta</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 13:59:32 GMT):<br/>
but guess an updation required

hey Fabric fans, given the amount of questions we've got around the progress of the Fabric support in FireFly, I just added a project board in the `firefly-fabconnect` repo that reflects what's been done, what's in progress and what are still on the docket. This should give you a sense of the planned scope for the first release we are working towards (let's call it `0.1`). 

here are the ways you can contribute:

hey Fabric fans, given the amount of questions we've got around the progress of the Fabric support in FireFly, I just added a project board in the `firefly-fabconnect` repo that reflects what's been done, what's in progress and what are still on the docket. This should give you a sense of the planned scope for the first release we are working towards (let's call it `0.1`).

Hi All, does anyone have an example payload for a create data type request?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Tue, 12 Oct 2021 15:41:24 GMT):<br/>
@mona15 Actaully we do have a docs page on this :) Have you seen this page? https://hyperledger.github.io/firefly/gettingstarted/define_datatype.html

Hi there, I have an upcoming project that stopped the MVP for a while but I will be trying to deploy the system again. So, it is a bit confusing to me but I will need to wake up an external Data Exchange, isn't it? is that all? I mean for a minimum system.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 13 Oct 2021 12:20:24 GMT):<br/>
We should maybe start a new thread for this one :) it took me a minute to find this one all the way back up here. Can you elaborate on what type of deployment you're trying to do? How many members, etc? I'm assuming this is not a development environment anymore, and is a production or pre-production environment?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 13 Oct 2021 12:21:16 GMT):<br/>
If you're using Kubernetes there is a helm chart in the FireFly repo now that may also be helpful to you: https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/tree/main/deploy/charts/firefly
</p>
<p><strong>OscarTBallester</strong> (Wed, 13 Oct 2021 12:22:05 GMT):<br/>
Yes, is a pre production environment. We want to check how easy is the onboarding process.

Hi all... I did a small experiment with jmeter to post requests through firefly API. I'm using multiple threads and do multiple post requests... In my explorer, it says 455 messages but 13 transactions... I thought every message is a transaction... Is there any batch processing or any aggregation happening behind the scene?
</p>

There is batch processing going on, briefly mentioned here: https://hyperledger.github.io/firefly/architecture/multiparty_event_sequencing.html#transaction-submission. @nguyer, did we have a community call on batching? Or help me find the right place in the docs :)
</p>

<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 08 Nov 2021 13:33:56 GMT):<br/>
Good question. This looks like a limitation of the UI, probably based on the API request that it's making to get the count. I think there's an upper bound on the type of request it's currently doing, so it probably gets capped at 10,000 (9,993 is suspiciously close to 10,000).

@shorsher is this something you could take a look at if you have a chance?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 08 Nov 2021 13:35:12 GMT):<br/>
Also, @KingAlawaka I would love to know more about your test configuration and what you're looking to prove. Thanks for pointing this out too!
</p>
<p><strong>KingAlawaka</strong> (Mon, 08 Nov 2021 13:54:50 GMT):<br/>
Hi @nguyer...
Thanks for the reply. I am planning to use firefly in my research to support multi-party communication. Since there is a fabric and Ethereum as options for a distributed ledger, I am trying to stress the stack and see what is the best ledger to use in my research. 
The test is simple API broadcast messages for all participants ( 3 member stack). I am increasing the number of API calls and analyzing error rate, throughput, time is taken to complete, etc.  I am using JMeter to automate these API calls and get the performance indexes. Currently, I am facing another strange behavior. Even after JMeter finishes its test cases, firefly nodes are heavily working. When I check the docker container performance firefly_core_0 is continuously running with high CPU usage. Since Jmeter finishes its test cases I believe firefly nodes should not continue to run like this. I send all the requests from one node (port 5000) so that the firefly node is still heavily using the resources in the containers. 
I am sorry if I didn't make any sense with my experiment or my explanation. I am very new to the field, and I like to explore. Please let me know your thoughts on my experiment or anything related to the firefly node performance after completing the tests.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 08 Nov 2021 14:11:50 GMT):<br/>
Very interesting. I wouldn't expect to see much CPU usage after the test has finished either so that is concerning. Would you mind sharing your JMeter configuration at some point when it's ready? I'd be interested in reproducing this behavior to investigate it as well
</p>
<p><strong>KingAlawaka</strong> (Mon, 08 Nov 2021 14:21:23 GMT):<br/>
Sure I'll share my JMeter configuration. However I cant upload it here.. zip files or .jmx files are not supported... how can I share it?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 08 Nov 2021 14:22:13 GMT):<br/>
is .tar.gz supported?

Sure! For transparency, the maintainers (including myself) are currently heads down trying to finish the last few major features for v1.0. But "production readiness", including this type of testing is the next major priority in getting ready for v1.0, so there will a lot of attention on it here soon.
</p>

I have setup my dev environment with fabric blockchain, and played a bit with the APIs.. I was wondering where i can find some additionnal tutorials, specificly on how to handle security for the users ?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 13:55:05 GMT):<br/>
Great! There are some tutorials here: https://hyperledger.github.io/firefly/gettingstarted/gettingstarted.html as well as a couple very small sample apps here: https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-samples Though more robust samples are definitely something we need.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 13:55:29 GMT):<br/>
For your question about security, are you wondering how to secure the FireFly API itself?
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 14:01:10 GMT):<br/>
Yes I've already test the firefly-sample and was stuck a bit as the  token part is still empty in the docs.. Yes exactly, for  now i can access the api on http access without tls nor identification nor api keys..
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 14:02:19 GMT):<br/>
Right. There is actually a very user-friendly walkthrough of the new tokens APIs that will be merged very shortly in this PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly/pull/306
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 14:03:40 GMT):<br/>
In terms of securing the API, normally in a production environment there would be some other service or load balancer in front of FireFly such as nginx or HAProxy which would authenticate requests
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 14:07:27 GMT):<br/>
Ok thx looking forward to it !
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 14:12:50 GMT):<br/>
So for security, my main app need to handle users connection, then securely connect to a node as a admin member, then send  the command to the blockchain to write something on the behalf of the user who did the request ?
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 14:13:43 GMT):<br/>
or do i need to create a member for each users  ?
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 14:42:25 GMT):<br/>
and one last question, is the concept of namespaces in firefly the same as channels in fabric  ?
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 14:43:14 GMT):<br/>
sorry for  such beginnners questions  :sweat_smile:
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 14:52:19 GMT):<br/>
No that's a great question! They are not actually the same and have some different use cases. Namespaces are a way to group definitions, data, messages, etc related to a specific app. It provides a way to look at a related subsection of the database/blockchain. However, namespaces in FireFly are not currently an access control. Use cases for different namespaces might be: 1) Running test transactions on a separate namespace to not pollute the default namespace 2) Running multiple apps on a single FireFly network
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 14:58:13 GMT):<br/>
Ok thank you. So if i need the concept of channels in Firefly, I need to forget about fabric and use instead a logic of datas&Events ? Originaly i was thinking creating a dedicated channel for each projects  of a user. I can still a different namespaces, or it is advise to not use too many namespaces ?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 15:03:43 GMT):<br/>
API support for using many Fabric channels in FireFly is coming, but it's not ready yet
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 15:04:33 GMT):<br/>
I think it will be possible to use multiple Fabric channels within one FireFly namespace
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 15:07:32 GMT):<br/>
Ok great looking forward to it ! If there is subproject  about this, i'll be happy to try to help :)
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 15:31:56 GMT):<br/>
Thanks! Will definitely include you when that work kicks off. There will be some core FireFly architecture work required as part of this as well.
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 15:38:07 GMT):<br/>
Yes I'm still quite new (less than 24 hours) but diving a bit in.. It seems through the fabconnector i can get more control about what's happening specificaly in the fabric network.. its seems to use by default a "default-channel"
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 15:38:36 GMT):<br/>
Yes, using Fabconnect's API you can use whatever channel you wish
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 15:40:22 GMT):<br/>
Yes it seems to be the correct way to use the MSPs to solve my security problem..but still not sure if i should focus on wallet on firefly instead  ?
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 15:40:32 GMT):<br/>
*also
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:24:07 GMT):<br/>
I did check to new doc, but was a bit struggling with the notion of plugin connector, where are they defined  ? thx
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:40:36 GMT):<br/>
"connectors" in FireFly are external microservices that perform a particular task (we have connectors for blockchain, data exchange, tokens, etc). They run separately, and your FireFly YAML config will point to the addresses of your various connectors.
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:41:36 GMT):<br/>
If you use the CLI to start an Ethereum stack, by default it will include an instance of the firefly-tokens-erc1155 connector for each node - your generated docker-compose file will contain entries to spin up these services, and your generated FireFly config will point to them
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:43:26 GMT):<br/>
Now in the case of Fabric, currently the CLI does not have support to generate any type of tokens. You definitely could do a mixed network where your messaging is backed by Fabric, but you use the firefly-tokens-erc1155 connector and issue tokens with Ethereum. This is completely supported by FireFly, but the CLI doesn't (yet) have support to automatically generate the config for this type of combination.
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:44:03 GMT):<br/>
ok thx, I used the cli to start a Fabric stack, and tried to use the API to create a token pool and got this message : {"error":"FF10272: Unknown tokens plugin 'tokens-erc1155'"}
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:53:08 GMT):<br/>
yea, you would need to configure a tokens plugin by adding an entry like this to the end of your firefly config.yaml (found under the ~/.firefly folder for your stack):
```
tokens:
- plugin: fftokens
  name: erc1155
  url: http://tokens_0:3000
```
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:53:14 GMT):<br/>
I think the correct API path is `erc1155`
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:53:24 GMT):<br/>
rather than `tokens-erc1155`
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:53:25 GMT):<br/>
but then you would also need a tokens microservice running on that port
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:53:48 GMT):<br/>
@nguyer the name corresponds to whatever your config entry specifies
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:53:51 GMT):<br/>
great ! I will test it asap :)
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:54:22 GMT):<br/>
@Kmm 4 adding the config will make FireFly accept the request, but actually bringing up a working tokens microservice to process the request is more involved
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:54:33 GMT):<br/>
Yep, @Andrew.Richardson is correct. I think the default that the FireFly CLI creates is just called `erc1155` though.
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:54:47 GMT):<br/>
you have to bring up tokens, and tokens depends on ethconnect, and ethconnect depends on geth
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:54:55 GMT):<br/>
and they all have to be configured to talk to each other
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:55:27 GMT):<br/>
this is why it's nice that the CLI does it automatically on Ethereum. I could try to give pointers on doing it manually, but it's rather involved.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:55:28 GMT):<br/>
It's also worth pointing out that the FireFly CLI does not have an "out-of-the-box" configuration which supports both Fabric/Fabconnect as the blockchain, but some other ethereum based token connector.
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:56:28 GMT):<br/>
ok i understand.. the correct way to achieve this is to work on firefly cli to make it more fabric friendly.. :)
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:56:37 GMT):<br/>
yes :)
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:56:56 GMT):<br/>
if you did want to play with tokens, currently the easiest way to do that is by starting an Ethereum stack
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:57:00 GMT):<br/>
is there any work started yet on this topic ?
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:57:32 GMT):<br/>
No, but I opened https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-cli/issues/120 a little while back
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:57:58 GMT):<br/>
actually i designed my system on Fabric and was looking for a reliable way to put this in production..that's why i checked the FireFly project
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:58:32 GMT):<br/>
@Kmm 4 are you using tokens (or planning to use tokens)?

<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 16:58:52 GMT):<br/>
Curious if you'd want to find some implementation of tokens on Fabric, or would want the combo of Fabric with Ethereum tokens as we're discussing here.
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 17:02:43 GMT):<br/>
I'm currently working on a crowdfunding plateform and need to emit/manage some tokens (noNFT & NFT) for each project. So I'm using the blockchain just as distributed database where to store these tokens. I choose a while ago to follow and get familiar with Fabric instead on Ethereum just to avoid gaz fees..
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 17:04:10 GMT):<br/>
Got it. For what it's worth, if you're hosting your own network (ie not on mainnet), you can choose to eliminate gas fees. You'd need to decide how the network would be built out though.
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 17:05:04 GMT):<br/>
so my preference is to find/make an implementationn of tokens on Fabric...
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 17:05:38 GMT):<br/>
Yea, definitely another route here is to create a brand new tokens connector that is backed by tokens on Fabric
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 17:06:05 GMT):<br/>
I'm not aware of a well-adopted standard for Fabric tokens, so it hasn't been on our immediate radar.
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 17:06:17 GMT):<br/>
Yes you can i guess eliminate gas fees but you will somehow need to struggle with them when hosting your solution no ?
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 17:07:33 GMT):<br/>
:) yea, hosting is a whole other set of problems
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 17:09:52 GMT):<br/>
I found some elegant solutions for fabric on aws, the have a  private cloud almost ready to use
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 17:10:16 GMT):<br/>
if you're at all interested in exploring what a Fabric tokens connector would look like, it would likely mean copying https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-tokens-erc1155 and changing the backend to point at some fabric thing instead of Ethereum
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 17:10:57 GMT):<br/>
It would also need a token chaincode as well
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 17:11:04 GMT):<br/>
correct
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 17:11:20 GMT):<br/>
Yes  I was currently checking it
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 17:12:31 GMT):<br/>
There are only a few APIs required for a token connector, so it's a matter of figuring out how those map to something like FabToken
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 17:21:56 GMT):<br/>
ok I should look in the solidity folder for changing backend pointer ?
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 17:22:57 GMT):<br/>
Token docs were actually just merged, so they are live here: https://hyperledger.github.io/firefly/gettingstarted/mint_tokens.html
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 17:25:21 GMT):<br/>
Yes, there are two components to the connector implementation. The actual smart contract is in that Solidity folder:
https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-tokens-erc1155/blob/main/solidity/contracts/ERC1155MixedFungible.sol

And the mapping code which maps HTTP requests to those smart contract methods is in the token service:
https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-tokens-erc1155/blob/main/src/tokens/tokens.service.ts
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 17:27:19 GMT):<br/>
For the Solidity portion, we used the reference ERC1155 contract from OpenZeppelin and extended it with mint and burn methods. Would need to decide a similar standard on Fabric and determine if it also needs any extensions.
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 17:29:02 GMT):<br/>
thank you that's a great help ! I will to replic a mint and burn for fabric
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 17:53:19 GMT):<br/>
sounds great - keep us posted on what you find and I'm happy to help figure out the implementation details. it would definitely be a great addition to the project.
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 18:04:09 GMT):<br/>
It also occurred to me that the token connector README was missing some important notes about how to deploy and run it manually. Perhaps @nguyer can give me an approval on these: https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-tokens-erc1155/pull/46
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 19:01:13 GMT):<br/>
Of  course ! For the solidity contract part instead of OpenZeppelin cani use https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/main/token-erc-1155
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 19:01:17 GMT):<br/>
?
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 19:04:12 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that looks like a very reasonable thing to try. Didn't know anybody had tried porting ERC1155 to Fabric.
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 19:06:53 GMT):<br/>
The one thing I see - it looks like this chaincode mainly deals with fungible tokens. If you wanted to work with non-fungible tokens, it may require some tweaks (so that if you specify a particular token is non-fungible, you cannot mint more than 1 of that token).
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 19:07:13 GMT):<br/>
But still, it's a very good starting point even to just get fungible tokens working on Fabric, and then go from there.
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 19:26:34 GMT):<br/>
ok thx i will keep investigate and keep you posted. thx :)
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 20:11:42 GMT):<br/>
A few background notes for how I implemented fungible/non-fungible pools on ERC1155:
- when you request to create a fungible pool, it allocates a single token ID - each time you call mint, it creates more of that token
- when you request to create a non-fungible pool, it allocates a range of token IDs (it masks off the high 128 bits as a "pool ID") - each time you call mint, it allocates a new token within that range by incrementing the lower 128 bits

There are some more notes in the Solidity contract, but that's essentially how I implemented the two types. Fungible is the easier one to implement, so again it's probably easiest to just start there.
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 20:18:12 GMT):<br/>
ok i saw that in solidity.. so you distinguish a NFT from a non NFT just by looking a the last bit of the token ID
</p>
<p><strong>Kmm 4</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 20:19:58 GMT):<br/>
I was also having a look at  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/main/token-erc-721 for NFT on fabric
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 20:32:24 GMT):<br/>
yes, ERC1155 can support multiple types of tokens, so I used a split bit implementation to distinguish fungible tokens from non-fungible tokens
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 20:32:42 GMT):<br/>
some other standards only support one type - like ERC721 is non fungible only
</p>

Hi guys
</p>
<p><strong>jas191</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 14:16:37 GMT):<br/>
Good morning guys,

I been trying to troubleshoot this issue for days now and was woundering if anyone any tips for a solution.

 trying to upload a  image file via firefly

using: 


curl --location --request POST 'http://35.175.18.83:5000/api/v1/namespaces/default/data' \
--form 'file=@"/C:/Users/mbarbuzzi/Downloads/sleeping-mask.png"'


and  pull the image file and it's information so we display in our app. 

however I can't figure how to do that using the Data Exchange API

I try using /data as a path or the blob hash but keeping no blob found.


Like:
 http://35.17.184.83:5105/api/v1/blobs/aacd217811aae10798bb53357f2d4b914762819e3d6b767a337b5b15c079e6c6
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 14:17:41 GMT):<br/>
Hey, good morning, and welcome!
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 14:18:31 GMT):<br/>
Is there a reason you want to use the Data Exchange's API to retrieve the image, vs just using FireFly's API for both uploading and retrieving?
</p>
<p><strong>jas191</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 14:59:15 GMT):<br/>
I would perfer to use FireFly for retrieving image
</p>
<p><strong>jas191</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 14:59:40 GMT):<br/>
but I did'nt see any info clear details on the website how I would pull that  data
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 14:59:45 GMT):<br/>
Okay great. Have you had a look at this example on the docs site? https://hyperledger.github.io/firefly/gettingstarted/private_send.html#example-3-upload-a-blob-with-metadata-and-send-privately
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 15:00:06 GMT):<br/>
Actually, that just shows how to upload it, which you already figured out
</p>
<p><strong>jas191</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 15:00:13 GMT):<br/>
yep :)
</p>
<p><strong>jas191</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 15:00:17 GMT):<br/>
not pull :(
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 15:00:56 GMT):<br/>
GET
/namespaces/{ns}/data/{dataid}/blob should give you need I think
</p>
<p><strong>jas191</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 15:52:53 GMT):<br/>
will try now
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 16:16:32 GMT):<br/>
Let me know if that doesn't work for you
</p>
<p><strong>jas191</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 16:49:54 GMT):<br/>
trying now
</p>
<p><strong>jas191</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 16:58:53 GMT):<br/>
is any tips on how we can secure the firefly api
</p>
<p><strong>jas191</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 16:59:47 GMT):<br/>
so only authorized people/app can run the quires?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:01:01 GMT):<br/>
Typically you would want it behind some sort of load balancer, reverse proxy, or other network appliance that is in charge of authenticating requests
</p>
<p><strong>jas191</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:03:56 GMT):<br/>
yea I had a feeling. just wanetd to make sure :)
</p>
<p><strong>jas191</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:04:00 GMT):<br/>

Hello all,

This is a notice that the Final Comment Period for FIR-4 Rest API Query Syntax Enhancements has begun, with a disposition to merge. It will close one week from today, on 2022-01-17. If you are interested in this functionality, this is the last opportunity to provide feedback on this proposed change.

This is a relatively small change and there is strong consensus among the maintainers. However it does introduce a breaking change, and thus is going through the FIR process. If your app uses query parameter filters on the FireFly API, you may be interested in giving it a look, if you haven't already.

Thanks!

Good Morning everyone,


After you upload a blob and Broadcast the uploaded data using the firefly API. how do you pull the Transaction Hash that would be linked via blockchain?
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 16:26:53 GMT):<br/>
Hi @jas191! Sorry I didn't see your message yesterday.

The gist of it is that you want to do is listen for a `message_confirmed` event for that broadcast and then you can look up more information about transaction at that point. There's a doc page here that should get you started on how listening for events works: https://hyperledger.github.io/firefly/gettingstarted/events.html

<p><strong>nandrews283</strong> (Sun, 30 Jan 2022 02:05:31 GMT):<br/>
I was wondering if someone could clarify how to upload a file into firefly on the IPFS. I understand that we can use the curl command as shown in the documentation, but I am struggling to implement this just using the API.
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Mon, 31 Jan 2022 14:27:23 GMT):<br/>
Hey @nandrews283! I assume you're looking at the docs here: https://hyperledger.github.io/firefly/gettingstarted/private_send.html#example-3-upload-a-blob-with-metadata-and-send-privately

You should also be able to upload a file using the Swagger UI (hosted at http://localhost:5000/api by default when running FireFly locally), or by using a tool like Postman. I can give more specific pointers on those, but is that the type of thing you're looking for?
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Mon, 31 Jan 2022 14:41:23 GMT):<br/>
The general flow in all cases is to set the request body format to "form-data", and then set "autometa=true" and set "file" to the actual file contents (similar to the curl command from the docs).

<p><strong>nandrews283</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 00:17:12 GMT):<br/>
Yeah! And that is what i was looking at. Sorry I am kind of a beginner to this. So say I have a PDF save to my local directory.

I would assume that with the Swagger UI or Postman I would use Post to "/namespaces/{ns}/data"

What would the Request body look like?
</p>
<p><strong>nandrews283</strong> (Wed, 02 Feb 2022 00:17:39 GMT):<br/>
OH!! multipart/form-data 

I did not even see that there, I will try that and report back. Thank you so much

Hi guys, this what trying to do with firefly-api however Im having some issues with the request and how to make it.
Trying to do that using firefly-api


upload a image file ie: boob  and mint an token at same time so it's associated to the image-upload then have  the token minted to send a specific wallet address


how would I do that in terms of query?




api endpoiont: api/v1/namespaces/default/tokens/mint

  "amount": 1,
  "to": "0x07eab7731db665caf02bc92c286f51dea81f923f",

    }]
  }
}
</p>
<p><strong>jas191</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 05:05:29 GMT):<br/>
also when I checked my stack via    firefly-tokens-erc1155  ff info does that get installed by default so you can use the tokens or no if not how do I add to my slack using the cli
</p>
<p><strong>jas191</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 10:10:00 GMT):<br/>
also using tokens is there a way to transfer the tokens into mobile wallet have a mobile work with fire, our app then does it thing push datta to ipfs we also want a token transfer to happen which would go to some external wallet
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 17:08:22 GMT):<br/>
@jas191 The token connectors for your stack can be configured with the `-t` option to the CLI, but the default is to create an instance of the ERC1155 connector for each member.

Regarding file upload, you must upload the file first before it can be used in a message or mint. You would follow the steps similar to what is described on this page for uploading a blob: https://hyperledger.github.io/firefly/gettingstarted/private_send.html#example-3-upload-a-blob-with-metadata-and-send-privately
Once you have uploaded the file and received an "id" for it, you can perform a mint as you have shown. You just include the data ID, such as `"data": [{ "id": "put-id-here" }]`

That will cause the data to be sent privately in a message, and also a new token will be minted (with the message ID and hash recorded on-chain in the mint operation). If you hit errors at any point, you can share them here.

As far as using mobile wallets with FireFly - that's a much longer answer and I know I won't be able to cover it myself. Possibly someone else here can. But more of the community has moved to the FireFly Discord now, so it might be a good topic to raise there if you're able: https://discord.com/invite/nnQw2aGhX6

Hello everyone, I was trying out the api to register custom on chain smart contracts and to interact with them using firefly.
But, the documentation for that part isn't there. I was wondering whether there is any example readily available with one of the maintainers
</p>
<p><strong>jas191</strong> (Thu, 10 Feb 2022 09:41:44 GMT):<br/>
How do I figure out what the operator is?  "operator should not be empty"  as tryng to mint a token and data along with it
</p>
<p><strong>jas191</strong> (Thu, 10 Feb 2022 09:42:11 GMT):<br/>
as the docs aren't very clear on that

@sukrutsathaye yes, the custom on-chain logic work is still in flight and only considered a "preview" at this point since it's still undergoing some evolution. I know @nguyer is deep in that work right now - was just reviewing his latest PR. Not sure if he has any examples laying around?
</p>
<p><strong>Andrew.Richardson</strong> (Thu, 10 Feb 2022 16:08:03 GMT):<br/>
@jas191 are you sending a request to FireFly or directly to the token connector? This looks like a response from the connector.
