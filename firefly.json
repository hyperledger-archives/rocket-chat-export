{"msg":"A new update to the FireFly CLI was just published (`v0.0.25`). Some changes in this version include:\n- Ganache CLI has been replaced by a proper geth node - This fixes some edge cases where ganache-cli behaved differently causing problems for Firefly.\n- The ability to run a FireFly core process outside of docker. This lets developers run the FireFly core with their IDE debugger while connecting that core process to a FireFly network where the rest of the processes are running inside docker. This should speed up the development cycle and make it easier for new contributors to get involved. Documentation on how to do this is in the process of being merged, but for now, you can read how to use this new feature here: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly/blob/785a35aea84a8081ad946ca01fcadaf9c4e0ee69/docs/contributors/dev_environment_setup.md","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-07-30T19:49:27.874Z"}

If you replace geth with something else, you will have still have some work to do, to get a working stack.\n\nWhen you run `ff start <stack_name>` the FireFly CLI does a lot of work to get configs ready before startup. This includes creating some docker volumes and copying config files and certs to them. The key part for the ethereum blockchain node is creating an address on chain (in the genesis block) for each member, setting them as signers, and making sure they are unlocked for submitting transactions at runtime.","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-08-10T17:35:19.657Z"}

I stubbed out a `BesuProvider` here: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly-cli/blob/blockchain-refactor/internal/blockchain/ethereum/besu/besuProvider.go It just needs the functions filled out.\n\nThere was a lot of code change in this branch, and it's largely untested.

If an event comes in before FireFly has resolved and parsed the HTTP response that triggered it, it's impossible to correlate (currently we hold the event for some time and poll to see if the ID becomes known, which is messy).

{"msg":"I was working with firefly the last week and I need some guidance, where can I look to know how to add new nodes to an existent network? Thanks!","username":"OscarTBallester","ts":"2021-09-17T13:09:46.391Z"}
{"msg":"Hi @OscarTBallester welcome! :wave:","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-09-17T14:18:09.365Z"}
{"msg":"You can register a node with the network by posting to the `/network/register/node/organization/` endpoint. You can see the code in the FireFly CLI that does this here: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly-cli/blob/main/internal/stacks/firefly_identity.go#L27","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-09-17T14:20:27.111Z"}
{"msg":"Actually, that URL is for registering the Org. To add a node to the org the URL is `/network/register/node`","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-09-17T14:51:35.102Z"}
{"msg":"Thanks for your answer, I saw that endpoint but appears as deprecated and with no info about payload, I mean in the API Spec","username":"OscarTBallester","ts":"2021-09-17T15:03:42.162Z"}
{"msg":"So what payload I should use?","username":"OscarTBallester","ts":"2021-09-17T15:04:02.900Z"}
{"msg":"Good question. I didn't realize that one was deprecated now. Let me get back to you on that in a bit","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-09-17T21:37:21.403Z"}
{"msg":"Ok, thanks. We are very interested in Firefly and the register node endpoint is a key feature for us.","username":"OscarTBallester","ts":"2021-09-20T11:11:14.763Z"}
{"msg":"Okay. I had a chance to test this. The new API endpoints are very similar. There is a new query parameter that you can include `?confirm=true` which will cause the HTTP request to block until registration succeeds, so you don't have to write polling code either.","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-09-20T13:18:37.648Z"}
{"msg":"So to register the org, `POST` to `network/organizations/self`. Then to register the node, `POST` to `network/nodes/self`","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-09-20T13:19:19.448Z"}
{"msg":"Ok, so I need to call this endpoint from another node, isn't it?","username":"OscarTBallester","ts":"2021-09-20T13:20:34.914Z"}
{"msg":"Something just needs to call this endpoint after the node starts up, to tell the node that it should register itself","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-09-20T13:27:15.378Z"}
{"msg":"It doesn't need to be another FireFly node. It could be curl, postman, or your own custom app","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-09-20T13:27:46.923Z"}
{"msg":"I mean, if I have a network working and I want to add a new node, how can I do it?","username":"OscarTBallester","ts":"2021-09-20T13:29:35.696Z"}
{"msg":"You just have to run the node, and post to that endpoint. If the node belongs to an org that is already registered, you can skip the call to `/network/organizations/self` when adding the new node","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-09-20T13:46:58.830Z"}
{"msg":"So the node should be in the same eth network? Or how the node knows into which network should register itself?","username":"OscarTBallester","ts":"2021-09-20T13:54:12.613Z"}
{"msg":"The FireFly config file should have a `blockchain` section defined which allows it to connect to the same blockchain that the rest of the FireFly nodes in the network are connected to. This is what allows the new node to broadcast its presence to the other nodes, through a blockchain event","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-09-20T14:12:01.822Z"}
{"msg":"Ah! Ok thanks, so where is this file located?","username":"OscarTBallester","ts":"2021-09-20T14:15:07.954Z"}
{"msg":"It can be anywhere on the filesystem. To point to the config file, use the `-f <config_file_path>` flag on the command line to start FireFly. If the path is not specified on the command line, FireFly will look for a yaml file named `firefly.core` in `/etc/firefly/` or `$HOME/.firefly`","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-09-20T14:24:22.713Z"}

{"msg":"Hi again, I read about a strong member governance in Firefly but I can't find any info about that in the API spec, can you say me how it works? Thank you again!","username":"OscarTBallester","ts":"2021-09-20T17:50:15.437Z"}
{"msg":"Hi Oscar. This is an area that is being very actively worked on right now. There are quite a few details in https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly/issues/187","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-09-20T17:59:58.500Z"}
{"msg":"Ok, thank you. I thought it was available now because I read about it as a current feature in the Firefly webpage.","username":"OscarTBallester","ts":"2021-09-20T18:02:43.238Z"}

{"msg":"Ah yeah. The short answer is, there are some things that page talks about that are still under development.","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-09-20T18:07:39.625Z"}
{"msg":"So, maybe the API spec is a better information source, right?","username":"OscarTBallester","ts":"2021-09-20T18:09:19.553Z"}
{"msg":"Yes. Things on GitHub or the docs site (https://labs.hyperledger.org/firefly/)(which is automatically built from source on merge to `main`) are the most accurate and up to date","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-09-20T18:10:33.857Z"}

{"msg":"Hey sorry just saw this","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-09-21T20:50:07.979Z"}
{"msg":"There is no way to update or modify uploaded data without assigning it a new ID. If there was, this would allow someone to \"rewrite history\". If this data was pinned to the blockchain, you can't change what the blockchain points to.","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-09-21T20:54:31.992Z"}
{"msg":"If you could describe your use case a bit more, perhaps I could guide you to a pattern that does work in firefly.","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-09-21T20:54:58.254Z"}

{"msg":"On your second question, if the data is JSON and you have defined a custom data type, FireFly will validate that the required fields are present when you upload the data","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-09-21T21:05:02.190Z"}
{"msg":"I defined a datatype company with the fields we need and I sent it using the data endpoint. Maybe there is a better way to do it.","username":"OscarTBallester","ts":"2021-09-21T21:06:12.962Z"}
{"msg":"I'm talking about first question","username":"OscarTBallester","ts":"2021-09-21T21:06:33.483Z"}
{"msg":"Makes sense. You probably also want to define another datatype that is something like `CompanyUpdateEvent` which is what you would send any time you want to update the existing company record.","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-09-21T21:20:49.168Z"}
{"msg":"If each message related to a specific company is sent using the same `topic`, they will be ordered, and you can also query the messages on that topic via the API to see the update history","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-09-21T21:21:39.167Z"}

{"msg":"You _could_ also just put the data inline in your message when you POST to `messages/broadcast`. This would be a simpler flow.

{"msg":"Hi @nguyer...\nThanks for the reply. I am planning to use firefly in my research to support multi-party communication. Since there is a fabric and Ethereum as options for a distributed ledger, I am trying to stress the stack and see what is the best ledger to use in my research. \nThe test is simple API broadcast messages for all participants ( 3 member stack). I am increasing the number of API calls and analyzing error rate, throughput, time is taken to complete, etc.  I am using JMeter to automate these API calls and get the performance indexes. Currently, I am facing another strange behavior. Even after JMeter finishes its test cases, firefly nodes are heavily working. When I check the docker container performance firefly_core_0 is continuously running with high CPU usage. Since Jmeter finishes its test cases I believe firefly nodes should not continue to run like this. I send all the requests from one node (port 5000) so that the firefly node is still heavily using the resources in the containers. \nI am sorry if I didn't make any sense with my experiment or my explanation. I am very new to the field, and I like to explore. Please let me know your thoughts on my experiment or anything related to the firefly node performance after completing the tests.","username":"KingAlawaka","ts":"2021-11-08T13:54:50.354Z"}

{"msg":"No that's a great question! They are not actually the same and have some different use cases. Namespaces are a way to group definitions, data, messages, etc related to a specific app. It provides a way to look at a related subsection of the database/blockchain. However, namespaces in FireFly are not currently an access control. Use cases for different namespaces might be: 1) Running test transactions on a separate namespace to not pollute the default namespace 2) Running multiple apps on a single FireFly network","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-11-24T14:52:19.747Z"}
{"msg":"Ok thank you. So if i need the concept of channels in Firefly, I need to forget about fabric and use instead a logic of datas&Events ? Originaly i was thinking creating a dedicated channel for each projects  of a user.

{"msg":"Yes I'm still quite new (less than 24 hours) but diving a bit in.. It seems through the fabconnector i can get more control about what's happening specificaly in the fabric network.. its seems to use by default a \"default-channel\"","username":"Kmm 4","ts":"2021-11-24T15:38:07.157Z"}

{"msg":"\"connectors\" in FireFly are external microservices that perform a particular task (we have connectors for blockchain, data exchange, tokens, etc). They run separately, and your FireFly YAML config will point to the addresses of your various connectors.","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T16:40:36.216Z"}
{"msg":"If you use the CLI to start an Ethereum stack, by default it will include an instance of the firefly-tokens-erc1155 connector for each node - your generated docker-compose file will contain entries to spin up these services, and your generated FireFly config will point to them","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T16:41:36.889Z"}
{"msg":"Now in the case of Fabric, currently the CLI does not have support to generate any type of tokens. You definitely could do a mixed network where your messaging is backed by Fabric, but you use the firefly-tokens-erc1155 connector and issue tokens with Ethereum. This is completely supported by FireFly, but the CLI doesn't (yet) have support to automatically generate the config for this type of combination.","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T16:43:26.394Z"}
{"msg":"ok thx, I used the cli to start a Fabric stack, and tried to use the API to create a token pool and got this message : {\"error\":\"FF10272: Unknown tokens plugin 'tokens-erc1155'\"}","username":"Kmm 4","ts":"2021-11-24T16:44:03.274Z"}
{"msg":"yea, you would need to configure a tokens plugin by adding an entry like this to the end of your firefly config.yaml (found under the ~/.firefly folder for your stack):\n```\ntokens:\n- plugin: fftokens\n  name: erc1155\n  url: http://tokens_0:3000\n```","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T16:53:08.775Z"}
{"msg":"I think the correct API path is `erc1155`","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-11-24T16:53:14.595Z"}
{"msg":"rather than `tokens-erc1155`","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-11-24T16:53:24.471Z"}
{"msg":"but then you would also need a tokens microservice running on that port","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T16:53:25.924Z"}
{"msg":"@nguyer the name corresponds to whatever your config entry specifies","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T16:53:48.202Z"}

{"msg":"@Kmm 4 adding the config will make FireFly accept the request, but actually bringing up a working tokens microservice to process the request is more involved","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T16:54:22.714Z"}
{"msg":"Yep, @Andrew.Richardson is correct. I think the default that the FireFly CLI creates is just called `erc1155` though.","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-11-24T16:54:33.251Z"}
{"msg":"you have to bring up tokens, and tokens depends on ethconnect, and ethconnect depends on geth","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T16:54:47.877Z"}
{"msg":"and they all have to be configured to talk to each other","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T16:54:55.390Z"}
{"msg":"this is why it's nice that the CLI does it automatically on Ethereum. I could try to give pointers on doing it manually, but it's rather involved.","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T16:55:27.644Z"}
{"msg":"It's also worth pointing out that the FireFly CLI does not have an \"out-of-the-box\" configuration which supports both Fabric/Fabconnect as the blockchain, but some other ethereum based token connector.","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-11-24T16:55:28.543Z"}
{"msg":"ok i understand.. the correct way to achieve this is to work on firefly cli to make it more fabric friendly.. :)","username":"Kmm 4","ts":"2021-11-24T16:56:28.342Z"}
{"msg":"yes :)","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T16:56:37.565Z"}

{"msg":"@Kmm 4 are you using tokens (or planning to use tokens)?","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T16:58:32.113Z"}

{"msg":"I'm currently working on a crowdfunding plateform and need to emit/manage some tokens (noNFT & NFT) for each project. So I'm using the blockchain just as distributed database where to store these tokens. I choose a while ago to follow and get familiar with Fabric instead on Ethereum just to avoid gaz fees..","username":"Kmm 4","ts":"2021-11-24T17:02:43.200Z"}
{"msg":"Got it. For what it's worth, if you're hosting your own network (ie not on mainnet), you can choose to eliminate gas fees. You'd need to decide how the network would be built out though.","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T17:04:10.252Z"}
{"msg":"so my preference is to find/make an implementationn of tokens on Fabric...","username":"Kmm 4","ts":"2021-11-24T17:05:04.234Z"}
{"msg":"Yea, definitely another route here is to create a brand new tokens connector that is backed by tokens on Fabric","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T17:05:38.061Z"}
{"msg":"I'm not aware of a well-adopted standard for Fabric tokens, so it hasn't been on our immediate radar.","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T17:06:05.265Z"}
{"msg":"Yes you can i guess eliminate gas fees but you will somehow need to struggle with them when hosting your solution no ?","username":"Kmm 4","ts":"2021-11-24T17:06:17.975Z"}

{"msg":"It would also need a token chaincode as well","username":"nguyer","ts":"2021-11-24T17:10:57.234Z"}
{"msg":"correct","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T17:11:04.048Z"}
{"msg":"Yes  I was currently checking it","username":"Kmm 4","ts":"2021-11-24T17:11:20.355Z"}
{"msg":"There are only a few APIs required for a token connector, so it's a matter of figuring out how those map to something like FabToken","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T17:12:31.868Z"}
{"msg":"ok I should look in the solidity folder for changing backend pointer ?","username":"Kmm 4","ts":"2021-11-24T17:21:56.476Z"}

{"msg":"Yes, there are two components to the connector implementation. The actual smart contract is in that Solidity folder:\nhttps://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-tokens-erc1155/blob/main/solidity/contracts/ERC1155MixedFungible.sol\n\nAnd the mapping code which maps HTTP requests to those smart contract methods is in the token service:\nhttps://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-tokens-erc1155/blob/main/src/tokens/tokens.service.ts","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T17:25:21.564Z"}
{"msg":"For the Solidity portion, we used the reference ERC1155 contract from OpenZeppelin and extended it with mint and burn methods. Would need to decide a similar standard on Fabric and determine if it also needs any extensions.","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T17:27:19.565Z"}
{"msg":"thank you that's a great help ! I will to replic a mint and burn for fabric","username":"Kmm 4","ts":"2021-11-24T17:29:02.099Z"}

{"msg":"It also occurred to me that the token connector README was missing some important notes about how to deploy and run it manually. Perhaps @nguyer can give me an approval on these: https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-tokens-erc1155/pull/46","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T18:04:09.488Z"}

{"msg":"?","username":"Kmm 4","ts":"2021-11-24T19:01:17.164Z"}
{"msg":"Yes, that looks like a very reasonable thing to try. Didn't know anybody had tried porting ERC1155 to Fabric.","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T19:04:12.254Z"}
{"msg":"The one thing I see - it looks like this chaincode mainly deals with fungible tokens. If you wanted to work with non-fungible tokens, it may require some tweaks (so that if you specify a particular token is non-fungible, you cannot mint more than 1 of that token).","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T19:06:53.493Z"}
{"msg":"But still, it's a very good starting point even to just get fungible tokens working on Fabric, and then go from there.","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T19:07:13.051Z"}
{"msg":"ok thx i will keep investigate and keep you posted. thx :)","username":"Kmm 4","ts":"2021-11-24T19:26:34.468Z"}
{"msg":"A few background notes for how I implemented fungible/non-fungible pools on ERC1155:\n- when you request to create a fungible pool, it allocates a single token ID - each time you call mint, it creates more of that token\n- when you request to create a non-fungible pool, it allocates a range of token IDs (it masks off the high 128 bits as a \"pool ID\") - each time you call mint, it allocates a new token within that range by incrementing the lower 128 bits\n\nThere are some more notes in the Solidity contract, but that's essentially how I implemented the two types. Fungible is the easier one to implement, so again it's probably easiest to just start there.","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T20:11:42.633Z"}
{"msg":"ok i saw that in solidity.. so you distinguish a NFT from a non NFT just by looking a the last bit of the token ID","username":"Kmm 4","ts":"2021-11-24T20:18:12.399Z"}
{"msg":"I was also having a look at  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/main/token-erc-721 for NFT on fabric","username":"Kmm 4","ts":"2021-11-24T20:19:58.701Z"}
{"msg":"yes, ERC1155 can support multiple types of tokens, so I used a split bit implementation to distinguish fungible tokens from non-fungible tokens","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2021-11-24T20:32:24.722Z"}

{"msg":"Good Morning everyone,\n\n\nAfter you upload a blob and Broadcast the uploaded data using the firefly API. how do you pull the Transaction Hash that would be linked via blockchain?","username":"jas191","ts":"2022-01-19T15:58:47.173Z"}
{"msg":"Hi @jas191! Sorry I didn't see your message yesterday.\n\nThe gist of it is that you want to do is listen for a `message_confirmed` event for that broadcast and then you can look up more information about transaction at that point. There's a doc page here that should get you started on how listening for events works: https://hyperledger.github.io/firefly/gettingstarted/events.html","username":"nguyer","ts":"2022-01-20T16:26:53.630Z"}

{"msg":"I was wondering if someone could clarify how to upload a file into firefly on the IPFS. I understand that we can use the curl command as shown in the documentation, but I am struggling to implement this just using the API.","username":"nandrews283","ts":"2022-01-30T02:05:31.264Z"}
{"msg":"Hey @nandrews283! I assume you're looking at the docs here: https://hyperledger.github.io/firefly/gettingstarted/private_send.html#example-3-upload-a-blob-with-metadata-and-send-privately\n\nYou should also be able to upload a file using the Swagger UI (hosted at http://localhost:5000/api by default when running FireFly locally), or by using a tool like Postman. I can give more specific pointers on those, but is that the type of thing you're looking for?","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2022-01-31T14:27:23.315Z"}
{"msg":"The general flow in all cases is to set the request body format to \"form-data\", and then set \"autometa=true\" and set \"file\" to the actual file contents (similar to the curl command from the docs).","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2022-01-31T14:41:23.172Z"}

{"msg":"@jas191 The token connectors for your stack can be configured with the `-t` option to the CLI, but the default is to create an instance of the ERC1155 connector for each member.\n\nRegarding file upload, you must upload the file first before it can be used in a message or mint. You would follow the steps similar to what is described on this page for uploading a blob: https://hyperledger.github.io/firefly/gettingstarted/private_send.html#example-3-upload-a-blob-with-metadata-and-send-privately\nOnce you have uploaded the file and received an \"id\" for it, you can perform a mint as you have shown. You just include the data ID, such as `\"data\": [{ \"id\": \"put-id-here\" }]`","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2022-02-04T17:08:22.033Z"}
{"msg":"That will cause the data to be sent privately in a message, and also a new token will be minted (with the message ID and hash recorded on-chain in the mint operation). If you hit errors at any point, you can share them here.","username":"Andrew.Richardson","ts":"2022-02-04T17:10:07.729Z"}
