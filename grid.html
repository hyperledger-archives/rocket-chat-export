<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 15 Jan 2019 18:49:06 GMT):<br/>
first topic for this channel will be the github repos we need. I'm thinking 'grid' or 'grid-core', 'grid-contrib', 'grid-website', 'grid-rfcs'
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 15 Jan 2019 19:01:31 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 15 Jan 2019 19:10:53 GMT):<br/>
what is your github ID?

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 15 Jan 2019 19:11:19 GMT):<br/>
"vaporos"

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 15 Jan 2019 19:11:54 GMT):<br/>
OK I deleted the old groups. I did send invites to that account for both of them.

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 15 Jan 2019 19:12:07 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 15 Jan 2019 19:14:17 GMT):<br/>
you're an maintainer for "grid admins", you should be able to add people etc

Hi, does grid use sawtooth?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 15:38:58 GMT):<br/>
yes, the traceability code for grid uses sawtooth, and is derived from sawtooth supply chain
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 16:19:29 GMT):<br/>
In the spirit of other top level projects like Explorer and Composer, we welcome contributions to support compatibility with the entire Hyperledger greenhouse
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 16:27:02 GMT):<br/>
This is not a Sawtooth-only project. The vision is for a set of open source frameworks and libraries for businesses to collaborate on and use to build great apps on any distributed (or centralized) platform. 
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 16:27:52 GMT):<br/>
The more places that code can run the better.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 16:28:50 GMT):<br/>
good point - even the traceability piece will evolve past it's sawtooth roots in the coming months
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 16:48:34 GMT):<br/>
Touching on the gs1/corp identity thing, I think the way let's encrypt does it is interesting via "proof of domain control": https://letsencrypt.org/how-it-works/
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 16:52:44 GMT):<br/>
@cecchi thoughts on what would be palatable to orgs as a lightweight way to prove who they are?
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 16:53:53 GMT):<br/>
like does this lets encrypt process seem onerous for big companies, for example?

@varinder off-hand it looks like a proxy problem. It looks like it's redirecting.  You can find out if it is going to a proxy by getting the headers.  Use something like `wget --server-response http://localhost:8024/agents`

@varinder Try setting NO_PROXY and no_proxy.  I sent you a DM. I always download and run `setup_intel_proxy.sh` available internally at https://intelpedia.intel.com/Proxy_at_Intel

<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Thu, 17 Jan 2019 18:18:05 GMT):<br/>
Proxy support: I looked at the source repos and it appears that the Supply Chain Dockerfiles supports proxy environment variables (such as NO_PROXY). 
But I see no proxy support in the Education Supply Chain Dockerfiles. If anyone knows more, please correct me.

Are you talking about "-environment" tag in sawtooth-supply-chain?

<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 17 Jan 2019 18:32:23 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 17 Jan 2019 18:37:27 GMT):<br/>
Continuing w/git discussion. I heard a preference off-line to keep 'grid' and not switch to 'grid-core'. Sounds fine to me. The other repos proposed are 'grid-contrib', 'grid-website', 'grid-rfcs', which I will request shortly (barring discussion which would change this list).
</p>
<p><strong>agunde</strong> (Thu, 17 Jan 2019 18:38:55 GMT):<br/>
I agree with keeping grid and not grid-core fwiw
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 17 Jan 2019 20:44:38 GMT):<br/>
the grid repo has been initialized with the contents from sawtooth-supply-chain. I'm going to start submitting PRs to it shortly to turn it into the starting point for grid
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 17 Jan 2019 21:26:45 GMT):<br/>
I requested a DNS entry for the website and submitted the request for the repos above.
</p>
<p><strong>rbuysse</strong> (Thu, 17 Jan 2019 22:08:38 GMT):<br/>
are we gonna decom the supply-chain repo?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 17 Jan 2019 22:47:18 GMT):<br/>
not immediately
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 17 Jan 2019 22:48:28 GMT):<br/>
it may continue to serve as a good application example, if we deviate significantly from it w/Grid (which seems very possible)

@amundson @rjones This is a great project, one question though - will the network design be modular like fabric. Supply chain processes that we are working on currently desire for a modular architecture with plug and play components for scalability and sustenance. 
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 16:59:08 GMT):<br/>
@JPonna the grid components are unlikely to even take a position on what the 'network' is. That's probably a job for the lower layers of the stack (e.g. the underlying ledger that is processing the grid transactions and maintaining state).
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 17:00:15 GMT):<br/>
Grid will help define the transaction formats, data types, storage formats, roles, permissions, etc. to allow applications to be built quickly
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 17:01:36 GMT):<br/>
Product is a good example. Instead of getting together with a consortium and saying "ok, first we need to define what a product is, and how we represent it, and how products are created and owned, etc...", we can say "we all use GS1 GTIN identifiers for our products, here's a grid component which already lays all that out, let's use it and focus on higher value stuff"
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 17:06:39 GMT):<br/>
and if we have other components like trading, or certification/audit, or shipping/BOL that all speak a common language (e.g. the trading rules operate on the exchange of Grid products as part of a trade), then it becomes possible to assemble a sophisticated set of business functionality very quickly

I am having issues transferring assets both using provided Sawtooth Fish Client Demo & Asset Track Demo. Also i am facing the same issue in my development environment..

These are the steps I am taking to transfer asset ->
https://demo.bitwise.io/asset
1. create a new account via Login/Signup
2. create new asset from the newly created account
3. transfer the asset to another existing user 
4. issue: owner does not change despite the asset transfer "Finalize".

In my local development environment owner does not change despite the asset transfer and I see repeating error in shell 

"supply-server | Received GET request for /agents from ::ffff:172.26.0.10
supply-asset-client | 172.26.0.1 - - [19/Jan/2019:00:58:51 +0000] "GET /api/agents HTTP/1.1" 304 -

</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 02:30:47 GMT):<br/>
@varinder the other user needs to 'accept' the asset
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 02:30:55 GMT):<br/>
assets are not 'push' in supply chain
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 02:31:02 GMT):<br/>
they require a request to transfer and an accept
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 02:31:25 GMT):<br/>
so you will need to log into the gui under the 2nd user, go to the asset, and accept the transfer
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 02:31:42 GMT):<br/>
the 'finalize' button is confusing, and it would probably be good to relabel it
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 02:31:57 GMT):<br/>
finalize - 'finalizes the assets life', this basically closes out the asset record

Hi everyone. I am going through the supply chain example and I can't seem to understand how data from the sensor is transferred to the blockchain. I would like to collect things like location data from an rfid tag and add it to the chain. Is there an illustration of this on the fishnet case? Thanks.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/grid?msg=msGurBEoETtrB7HBd) @PaulaBanks I believe the UI in the supply chain example is for manual data insertion only. For collecting data via sensors, the sensors will probably need to submit rest api call (if running natively, browse something like localhost:8024/batches) as lightly mentioned here  "For the adventurous, these actions can also be accomplished directly with the REST API running on the Supply Chain server, perfect for automated IoT sensors."
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 21:48:02 GMT):<br/>
@PaulaBanks @varinder That's right, we don't have code that runs on any particular sensor or device, we just submit transactions in the way we would do it on the device. The two apps (fish, assets) are examples of how you can use the underlying smart contract functionality. There is some automation/example of that in the JS code. Grid is going to switch all the npm-based stuff to Rust though, so that stuff will quickly be #sawtooth-supply-chain specific and not Grid-specific.

@amolk My apologies, as I understand that is late for some folks interested in attending, but 11am is the time that seems to work best for the Grid maintainers, so we would like to make sure they can attend the initial meetings. As we go forward, we can determine if there are better options.

</p>
<p><strong>Claudius1</strong> (Thu, 07 Feb 2019 17:02:18 GMT):<br/>
Is there a list of current maintainers for Grid project? Not sure about the process for maintainers in projects in incubation status. Many thanks

</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 07 Feb 2019 17:08:37 GMT):<br/>
this will evolve over time, but is basically going to be derived from participation. we plan to adopt an governance process similar to that of sawtooth https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-rfcs/  
</p>
<p><strong>Claudius1</strong> (Thu, 07 Feb 2019 17:19:42 GMT):<br/>
@amundson  Perfect. Thanks! I know it's somewhere on the Hyperledger wiki, but maybe you have it handy: is there a role description for a Maintainers, subteam members, subteam leads, etc? 
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 07 Feb 2019 17:20:15 GMT):<br/>
for sawtooth, it is this doc - https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-rfcs/blob/master/text/0006-sawtooth-governance.md
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 07 Feb 2019 17:21:48 GMT):<br/>
so, I'll submit a governance proposal for grid based on that after I have the RFCs repo setup
</p>
<p><strong>Claudius1</strong> (Thu, 07 Feb 2019 18:19:42 GMT):<br/>
@amundson  great, thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 07 Feb 2019 19:55:20 GMT):<br/>
I just merged changes to the grid repo and the grid-contrib repo which splits the track and trace code into two pieces, the platform pieces (remaining in the grid repo) and the example pieces (which are now in the grid-contrib repo).
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 07 Feb 2019 19:58:43 GMT):<br/>
if someone is looking for a way to contribute short-term, the docker compose files in the grid-contrib repo need to be repaired so the examples can be run with the platform code in the grid repo.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 07 Feb 2019 20:01:13 GMT):<br/>
remaining items for track and trace in the grid repo itself: 1) fix up the docs, 2) upgrade docker-compose files to sawtooth 1.1.
</p>
<p><strong>Claudius1</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 16:37:53 GMT):<br/>
All, forgive the likely basic question, but since i'm a newbie: i saw somebody mentioning a supply chain example. Not sure where that is. Is that in Sawtooth? Not clear how to get started with Grid (understanding this is just the beginning).
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 18:57:21 GMT):<br/>
@Claudius1 there are two pieces currently. there is the code in the grid repo https://github.com/hyperledger/grid/, including the initial track an trace smart contract. we will be adding some more smart contracts shortly, like pike (org/identity), product catalog, etc. we will also add other platform code there like a grid CLI, state delta processors (database export), and reusable UI components. Then we also have the grid-contrib repo, https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-contrib/, which contains examples, prototypes, etc. that are not yet part of the platform. this is where the track and trace example code for the fishnet and asset track are, as well as a track and trace rest API and state delta export code.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 18:59:43 GMT):<br/>
the platform code in can be run by cloning the repo and doing 'docker-compose up'. but, as it does not include a client, it is not super exciting unless you are developing with it. the track and trace code in contrib works but because I just split it off to contrib, it needs some work before it can be easily started up with docker-compose. (see my above TODO commentary).
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 19:02:02 GMT):<br/>
The track-and-trace code is currently substantially similar to sawtooth supply chain (currently only a few modifications since we forked it) -- https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-supply-chain/ and there is a demo of that running at https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-supply-chain/ and https://demo.bitwise.io/asset/#!/

I unfortunately missed the meeting yesterday. Are there any notes? 
</p>
<p><strong>Claudius1</strong> (Tue, 12 Feb 2019 16:44:38 GMT):<br/>
All, a couple of quick general questions. I know in next weekly meeting the RFC(Request For Comments) process will be presented, but to have an initial understanding: is RFC process common to all Hyperledger projects? I see that in Fabric documentation, a feature proposal can be made using Jira. https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONTRIBUTING.html#making-feature-enhancement-proposals 
</p>
<p><strong>Claudius1</strong> (Tue, 12 Feb 2019 16:46:38 GMT):<br/>
The RFC, as far as i see it, is for substantial changes. But not sure if RFC is used more in Sawtooth (found a clear description there  https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-rfcs#what-the-process-is) compared to other projects.

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 12 Feb 2019 18:59:48 GMT):<br/>
Indy and Ursa also use a similar RFC process
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 12 Feb 2019 19:02:28 GMT):<br/>
I don't see a problem tracking features in JIRA, even if they are substantial enough to justify an RFC
</p>
<p><strong>Claudius1</strong> (Tue, 12 Feb 2019 19:54:24 GMT):<br/>
Agree. I was just wondering if an RFC is always needed for a substantial feature, or adding an epic or story to Jira, properly documented, can be enough. Not that important, really. Just noticed the possible different approaches and wanted to make sure.

On an anticipatory note, is Grid going to be all DLT only or will it also include other popular technologies like BigData in the solution stack? There might be a requirement when storing things on a scaled up system. So organizations might want to store actual data in some BigData cluster with only urls(actual data location) on the chain.
This is one aspect. There could be other such aspects where we might want to support these ubiquitous technologies out of the box.

@rranjan3 our expectation is to use DLT as a building block, but not the only build block. we feel the technology should solve the use case.

@rranjan3 We are also looking into a solution for Big Data in healthcare applications, such as genome sequence data, medical imaging, meta-genomics, and so on. For sequence data Nebula has an interesting solution that hashed the sequences into tiles (that's the short description) based on this paper doi:10.7287/peerj.preprints.1426v1.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/grid?msg=ukQmy3Ks4qwZvom5H) @mfford Looking forward to the new schedule and learning more about https://github.com/hyperledger/grid. Currently unsure about how grid will shape up into sample code. I'm stuck making contributions without knowing more, but do plan to contribute. 
</p>

@cliveb Great to hear that you're interested in contributing! Stay tuned for more on the HL Grid Contributor Meeting.

The organizer of the Hyperledger Berlin meetup reached out to me and asked if there is someone near there who could speak at an event about Grid. Are there any Grid contributors based nearby?  If not, are there any Grid contributors who would be interested in doing a remote presentation to that group?  If we did that, we could record it and sharing it with a wider audience as well.

@mfford Previously I ran the Hyperledger RequirementsWG. We collected multiple specs for supply chain use cases. Would it help Grid If I cleaned up a spec for a common supply use case such as contract manufacturing (i.e even Boeing has run into synchronization problems with new 737 MAX due to supply chain).

<p><strong>NedSnark</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 20:15:11 GMT):<br/>
quick question, looks like sawtooth also good for supp-chains, so what are the key/basic differences that grid does/solves that Sawtooth doesn't have/do?
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 20:18:04 GMT):<br/>
grid is the data models, business logic, etc. in consumable 'framework' form. sawtooth is a blockchain platform.
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 20:18:50 GMT):<br/>
the idea is you'd build an app quickly using the grid frameworks and run the app on a platform that supports grid's execution semantics (like sawtooth).
</p>
<p><strong>NedSnark</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 20:46:26 GMT):<br/>
got it, makes perfect sense, thx
</p>
<p><strong>NedSnark</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 20:46:47 GMT):<br/>
any idea roughly speaking when Grid may be ready to actually start building with or using?

Hi guys, I met several Indy contributors in the HK Hyperledger Bootcamp. Heard that Grid project may have plan on integrating Sawtooth and Indy together. It is really interesting to me. May I ask what role Indy will, or in general how would identity management looks like in Grid?

Grid Primitives RFC draft is up - https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-rfcs/pull/4
</p>
<p><strong>anaswar</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 13:47:10 GMT):<br/>
hi all.. are the repos 'https://github.com/hyperledger/grid' and 'https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-contrib' ready for deploying the sample track and trace solution? or still under dev?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 14:44:03 GMT):<br/>
@anaswar you should be able to use docker compose to start it up (the most recent PR for this work is https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-contrib/pull/4) you have to have 'grid' and 'grid-contrib' checked out next to each other (in the same directory. (I haven't personally tested this yet, and Ryan is on vacation.)
</p>
<p><strong>anaswar</strong> (Wed, 20 Mar 2019 04:34:31 GMT):<br/>
thank you @amundson, will definitely try it out !
</p>
<p><strong>cliveb</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:02:13 GMT):<br/>
@amundson @anaswar with 'grid' and 'grid-contrib' checked out next to each other. I tired using ... is this the right approach to try out? https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/app_developers_guide/docker.html
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:28:57 GMT):<br/>
@cliveb not exactly, though its related. basically you do "docker-compose up" in grid/ and in another window, "docker-compose up" in grid-contrib/track_and_trace/
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:29:10 GMT):<br/>
however, I think it has issues from some other activity today
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:29:14 GMT):<br/>
```grid-track-and-trace-tp | error: failed to load source for a dependency on `grid-sdk`

@agunde ^
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:31:12 GMT):<br/>
I suspect we need to copy the sdk directory in that Dockerfile
</p>
<p><strong>agunde</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:35:23 GMT):<br/>
@amundson is that from docker-compose up in grid or grid contrib? 
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:35:35 GMT):<br/>
grid
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:35:59 GMT):<br/>
a similar error in grid-contrib, but this is the contracts/track_and_trace/Dockerfile I think
</p>
<p><strong>agunde</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:36:44 GMT):<br/>
Let me rebuild my docker containers real quick because it worked for me. That dockerfile should copy the sdk over already
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:39:03 GMT):<br/>
yeah... it's probably my environment, I'll add some options to the docker-compose up and see if it resolves.
</p>
<p><strong>agunde</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:40:07 GMT):<br/>
Make sure you don't have an old Cargo.lock file around from before. Protos don't always get build correctly otherwise if they have been updated. 
</p>
<p><strong>agunde</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:42:22 GMT):<br/>
@amundson contrib still fails. I think thats a location issue with where the dockerfile is trying to find the sdk. 
</p>

oh, the grid-contrib one is standalone currently
</p>
<p><strong>agunde</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:50:47 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>agunde</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 18:04:33 GMT):<br/>
@cliveb you just need to start up grid-contrib docker-compose. It will pull in track and trace if the folder are next to each other. 
</p>

<p><strong>anaswar</strong> (Tue, 26 Mar 2019 13:39:02 GMT):<br/>
I am getting a bit confused looking at the `grid` and `grid-contrib` repos.. 

1. is the WebAssembly (WASM) Smart Contract interpreter implemented using the Rust programs in `grid/contracts/track_and_trace/src/` ?
2. actual smart contracts (chaincode) is wirtten in `grid-contrib` repo 

Please confirm if my understanding stated above are right 
</p>
<p><strong>agunde</strong> (Tue, 26 Mar 2019 13:44:51 GMT):<br/>
The WASM Smart Contract interpreter is located here https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sabre. grid/contracts will house wasm smart contracts that can be used with Sabre. Track and Trace needs some small updates to be able to be run with Sabre but can currently run as a Sawtooth Transaction Processor. The changes should be submitted soon. There are a two rfc currently up for grid that explains 2 new smart contracts that will be written for grid https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-rfcs/pulls. 
</p>
<p><strong>agunde</strong> (Tue, 26 Mar 2019 13:46:22 GMT):<br/>
Grid-contrib is a place for community submitted software that is not yet a part of grid. For example the Track and Trace example apps are house in grid.

Chaincode is for Fabric. Grid is based on Sabre WASM smart contracts which currently are supported by Sawtooth.  We welcome contributions/compatibility with other top level Hyperledger projects, including Fabric.

@rbuysse  NAFIK. To make sure, I did a clean boot on Macbook after pulling down latest CL. Grid starts fine. 'docker-compose up' in $ grid-contributor/track_and_trace errors while bringing up the project. Screen shots follow.

Hi All, I just cloned and ran grid-contrib (899036d26f330223bdf17ced275833445ea33b53) and grid (244ff4e6f6edb4debb49ecca6bc69c8ec09b7c0d) and got the error "Record Type does not exist asset" when I try to add a new record to the asset tracker app localhost:8021/#!/create Also, tnt-shell is saying "Server unavailable, retrying in 5 seconds..." forever.

@pdxjohnnyintel we have a JIRA project setup - https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/GRID/issues
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 21:18:08 GMT):<br/>
@cliveb @rbuysse I think we need to move to a slightly different model between these repos. maybe one where we give docker-compose multiple -f options instead of duplicating the content over to contrib.

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 16 Apr 2019 19:22:39 GMT):<br/>
I updated the JIRA issue - really, we need these to go into the grid daemon (gridd in the repo) and we are using actix instead of rocket (because rocket requires nightly rust, and we want grid daemon to use stable rust).

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 15:45:57 GMT):<br/>
There's some minor bugs in the docker-compose for sawtooth-supply-chain. is this code more actively maintained in grid-contrib? Happy to get it fixed either way, but more curious where the longer term home is for that code.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 15:50:25 GMT):<br/>
@Dan my thought is this. we should move sawtooth-supply-chain and other things to sawtooth-contrib. the track and trace stuff in Grid is currently derived from it, but will quickly deviate and not provide the same type of example on how to do a sawtooth app. (it will start to, for example, depend heavily on the grid sdk). so there is probably room for both.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 15:52:10 GMT):<br/>
FWIW, it's already been integrated into grid. so it's really a sawtooth discussion on whether the maintaining it as an example is worthwhile.
</p>
<p><strong>cliveb</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 16:45:09 GMT):<br/>
If there's a decision made to move sawtooth-supply-chain code to sawtooth-contrib. That sounds like a contribution a remote dev could make and test w/o too much guidance. I will start by make a design doc on targets that need to move. Get that approved before moving the code. If so feel free to please assign to @cliveb.

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 18:48:08 GMT):<br/>
@cliveb we probably need to do a sawtooth rfc to make sure we have agreement before doing the contrib repo in sawtooth. it's a relatively large change for sawtooth if we go down that path.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 18:49:59 GMT):<br/>
@cliveb I've been running grid a lot and I don't think I've seen that. can you do "docker-compose down" and then "docker-compose up --build" to make sure you have recently built images.

@cliveb you need to run docker-compose from the grid directory. make sure you have both the grid and grid-contrib repos next to each other, then: cd grid/; docker-compose up -f docker-compose.yaml -f ../grid-contrib/track_and_trace/docker-compose.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 26 Apr 2019 15:38:28 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 26 Apr 2019 16:03:23 GMT):<br/>
@jsmitchell @cecchi I feel like you are misrepresenting me. I'd argue the RFCs are code.
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Fri, 26 Apr 2019 16:04:51 GMT):<br/>
so the EPCIS stuff could go in an EPCIS RFC as "references" or something

Hi all, any word on that follow-up design discussion we seemingly need to have per our friday meeting? For product at least. I'm hesitant to move forward. I am free this afternoon/tomorrow. Matt and I will be out of town wed-fri.

<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Mon, 29 Apr 2019 16:12:19 GMT):<br/>
With respect to Date primitives,there are a couple of ways we could store these: ISO 8601 strings or a int64 of millis since the unix epoch (akin to Java Date values), plus a timezone adjustment.  E.g.: 
```
message Date {
    int64 milliseconds = 1;
    int16 timezone_offset = 2; // offset in minutes
}
```
The default timezone offset would be `0`, and therefore be `Z`
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 29 Apr 2019 18:33:30 GMT):<br/>
Another option would be ISO 8601
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Mon, 29 Apr 2019 22:13:13 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, that was my first option
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Mon, 29 Apr 2019 22:13:34 GMT):<br/>

@rjones @Silona can JIRA be used for labs projects? we might have a project coming to labs, and zenhub looks better than jira if we can get a consolidated board across all the projects. we know we can do this inside JIRA but that presumes we are using jira for everything.

Hi guys! 
</p>
<p><strong>Gena</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 18:38:42 GMT):<br/>
So I am in the Product RFC, and I am just curious if we nailed down the minimum set of required attributes? That will be very helpful for comments/input.  Also - an understanding of the expected use of "product" (which should help inform the former)? I think there was a discussion about having a design session, but not sure where things landed? Thank you! @adeebahmed  - wondering if we should/could have a follow up call as we look toward location? 
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 19:33:42 GMT):<br/>
note - there is now a #transact channel for the new HL project that Sawtooth, Grid, and potentially others will eventually use for transaction processing

Yes @Gena, we had a post design meeting the following week after our 2-day. We arrived at keeping product as generic as possible. it will include a GTIN and a repeated field for additional property values. Apologies for the late response. 
</p>
<p><strong>adeebahmed</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 16:59:52 GMT):<br/>
The current product RFC will be refactored to reflect our decision. Think of this as sort of a "base" implementation of product that can be extended on for what ever use case
</p>
<p><strong>Gena</strong> (Fri, 10 May 2019 18:36:42 GMT):<br/>
Ok. I am surmising that location (or is it party) would be the same? GLN would be use as the party or location identifier, with repeated fields for property values? 
</p>
<p><strong>adeebahmed</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 16:10:06 GMT):<br/>
Are you asking in relation to product?
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 16:17:47 GMT):<br/>
I think the question was 'is this general pattern also going to apply to Location and other concepts?' and my answer would be 'yes'.
</p>
<p><strong>viossat</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 19:34:39 GMT):<br/>
In Grid, are data visible to everyone?
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 19:52:46 GMT):<br/>
@viossat the visibility of data is a question of who runs distributed ledger nodes and what data flows between parties. Grid is meant to be a set of reusable components defining data models and smart contracts which can be run on those distributed ledgers. The specific implementation may choose to make data broadly visible to a set of consortium members, or constrain it to specific parties, based on its capabilities. In other words, Grid doesn't take a position on this. It's a concern of the ledger on which the Grid code runs.
</p>
<p><strong>viossat</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 19:56:34 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. Is there an on-chain way to allow someone to read one of my data while keeping it encrypted to the others people?
</p>
<p><strong>adeebahmed</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 20:38:49 GMT):<br/>
Updated the product RFC per our post design discussion. Overall changes have narrowed the scope of this RFC down to a "base" product, such that complex product types can be be derived from this (i.e. food product, clothing, furniture, services, etc.) https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-rfcs/pull/5 @Gena @MelanieNuce 
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 20:56:52 GMT):<br/>
@viossat that is not a Grid question, but my advice would be not to share information with parties that shouldn't have access to it.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 14:22:39 GMT):<br/>
@agunde @mfford @mattp @adeebahmed and I were chatting yesterday about how to handle issue tracking yesterday, and I'd like to summarize here.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 14:24:47 GMT):<br/>
There are reservations about Zenhub because it requires all-or-nothing permissions and would force us to expose permissions to private repos to Zenhub. A secondary concern is lack of support for multiple dashboards per repo (you can do multiple repo per dashboard, but not the inverse).
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 14:25:36 GMT):<br/>
There are reservations about using HL JIRA because HL doesn't have enough resources to help configure it.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 14:28:06 GMT):<br/>
The current thinking is that we proceed with a kanban board in JIRA for Grid, assuming we can get enough support from HL to create a workflow with the appropriate states. Kanban because cross-company sprint boundaries don't really make sense and we want to be friendly to all contributors. But we would add columns to enable sprint planning for those of us that are doing sprints. (Kind of like the teams have been using waffle.)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 14:30:16 GMT):<br/>
We would create a label in JIRA that could be added to issues that we want to discuss during the montly contributor meeting.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 14:33:46 GMT):<br/>
It looked possible yesterday to do cross-project boards based on saved filters, so @mfford is planning to look into that to see if it's a viable approach. Lack of a cross-project board solution will make it difficult to manage planning using HL JIRA, since many of the maintainers work on 3+ HL projects.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 14:34:29 GMT):<br/>
[ end summary ]

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 15:17:06 GMT):<br/>
this is a thread about JIRA
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 15:17:36 GMT):<br/>
@amundson @mfford what is the goal with the JIRA mods
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 15:19:21 GMT):<br/>
looking at the configuration for sawtooth and grid, they have the same workflows
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 15:21:39 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 15:24:08 GMT):<br/>
@amundson you've been an admin of the project since I created it in JIRA. Are you still blocked?

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 15:35:28 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 15:36:00 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 15:37:24 GMT):<br/>
from what @mfford was showing me this morning, he might have that piece figured out via creating a dashboard off of a filter (I think that's the approach).
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 15:38:30 GMT):<br/>
OK. are you blocked on the import issue?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 15:39:19 GMT):<br/>

@rjones we don't think we have any blockers - we've been able to edit workflow and create a multi-project board that looks pretty nice. so we are going to start working toward using it and see if things pop up (over the next few days).

Sounds like Jira issues have been resolved. There was an earlier comment about HL resources to support Jira. If there is still a perceived resourcing gap I would like to know. We are constantly evaluating where we have resource gaps across HL and whether/how to address them.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Mon, 20 May 2019 00:01:02 GMT):<br/>
Please be aware that HL has recently started a Logistics and Supply Chain SIG. [HL facilitates SIGs as well as projects and Working Groups. We deemed that SIGs were out of scope for TSC and are instead facilitated by HL staff. My perception is they tend to be business people more than developers. ]

Hello.  I am looking at using Grid as a POC to demo to my blockchain committee at work.  Is there somewhere to view the requirements for standing up a solo setup?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 13:34:55 GMT):<br/>
That's a good question.
You can run this right from your laptop (it will probably take 30 min or so the first time you run it so it can download and compile everything). https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-contrib/tree/master/track_and_trace

If you are more interested in HW requirements that model production, it will probably depend most on your disk throughput. So on a physical machine, just make sure it has an SSD, and on a cloud instance make sure it's configured for something akin to SSD (high iops).

Of course a real deployed solution is going to use several nodes for the blockchain component and whatever sort of clients you need.

Grid PR# 78 was merged this morning. It updates the Track and Trace Transaction Processor in Grid to use Pike Agents and Grid Schema. These changes cause transactions submited via  the track-and-trace clients in grid-contrib to fail.  Bellow are examples of the messages you might see. The team is currently working on updating the track and trace clients in grid-contrib, to submit transactions in the format required by the current Track and Trace Transaction Processor.  Please, let me know if you have any questions.

I've been contemplating a Grid concept around distributed/decentralized permissions. But it includes packaging of the applications as a desired outcome. I want to drive through some use cases and see how this fits into some overall Grid directions. @amundson - we've chatted and I'd like to see who to pull in on further convos. Would a Grid-RFC make sense?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 15:34:23 GMT):<br/>
RFCs can be a hefty process. Nothing wrong with mailing the list an idea. If that looks to people like it should be an RFC you've already got the seed of the text.

<p><strong>desktophero</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 04:52:35 GMT):<br/>
A use case: One of the constraints I'm attempting to address is that new Docker images would be generated (in some fashion) as part of a new version of an artifact on chain, specifically smart contracts. I'm not yet comfortable with the idea of using Docker images in a Kubernetes environment where auto-scale (at an app level) or k8s cluster events (node rolling) would mean relying on mutating a defined Docker image defined as a replica in a deployment. That mutation coming from on-chain applications. My preference would be to say that the on-chain change of a new version of the smart contract generates a new Docker image (tested via a pipeline) and updated into a manifest (Helm, vanilla YAML, whatever), and then through a CI/CD pipeline "approved" to get deployed. I realize there are some other gates in those steps but I've seen some automated deployments in a controlled pipeline k8s implementation get into a roll back loop and not be able to run any pods because everything is sideways.

@mattp we used sticker mule in the past for some of them (the ones without 'Hyperledger' on them - those were done by HL directly). do you have the grid svg?
</p>
<p><strong>mattp</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 16:26:48 GMT):<br/>

basically "stay away from ring" is the take away

<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 21:37:27 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 25 Jun 2019 21:50:43 GMT):<br/>
grid-daemon depends on ring indirectly because actix-web uses cookie

this is a very cool tool - https://github.com/sfackler/cargo-tree

```ring v0.13.5

Hello Team, I am a complete beginner in terms of Hyperledger Grid and want to develop a supply chain solution on Blockchain.
I have got hands-on experience of Hyperledger Fabric and now want to build a supply chain solution using Hyperledger Grid.
So I would like to understand the correct approach to go through the basics and other necessary material to start my development.
Also I would like to understand if it is mandatory to understand Hyperledger Sawtooth in order to start with GRID ?

@HLFPOC The track_and_trace example apps (fish_client and asset_client) in grid-contrib are good examples of applications which uses several of Grid's components. There is a dependency on Sawtooth.
</p>
<p><strong>HLFPOC</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 04:11:11 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the reply! I assume I will have to start with Sawtooth first before jumping directly into the GRID samples

The Grid Primitives RFC should be re-reviewed, and probably moved towards final comment period soon: https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-rfcs/pull/4
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 15:46:29 GMT):<br/>
@pschwarz I read through the RFC and it looks fine to me. Once everyone on the core subteam has had a chance to do a final read through, I agree we should move to FCP.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 15:47:52 GMT):<br/>
@cecchi was advocating for renaming 'schema'. I don't have a solid alternative suggestion that is better though.

<p><strong>agunde</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 16:55:27 GMT):<br/>
The members of the subteams need to be added as maintainers and codeowners in the RFC repo. Once that is done you will be able to review PRs in the Grid RFC repo. Note you can still add comments before this is complete.

Hi all, we've been working on building a supply chain tracking solution with Sawtooth, and have just recently become aware of this project. How close is Grid to exiting incubation? We are thinking about whether to continue investing our effort with Sawtooth or begin exploring Grid.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 14:07:47 GMT):<br/>
Hi @cheeky the two should be pretty well aligned. Sawtooth will be your deployment layer and Grid offers libraries, data types, etc. to facilitate the App Layer development. The original work for Grid spun out from the supply chain example in Sawtooth.

<p><strong>MelanieNuce</strong> (Wed, 24 Jul 2019 22:18:19 GMT):<br/>
Yes, agreed. I apologize for not getting back to you on the DM about this. I was confusing your ask with an attribute association (grouping items together that have like characteristics). @Gena clarified for me that this is about actual exchange of item data for multiple items, and in that case, Catalogue Item Sync and of course the actual schema for the payload - Catalogue Item Notification, would both be in play. Should we schedule a call to discuss?

<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:05:36 GMT):<br/>
thoughts on the name 'product type' as an attribute of Product schema, but meaning the more specific "type" (GS1, etc) of Product.  I have some concerns about this being a heavily used term within the product domain generally, so avoiding overloading it here may make sense.  I also think this will set precedent for other Schemas with similar patterns
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:05:59 GMT):<br/>
options could be (others welcome):
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:06:08 GMT):<br/>
product_spec
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:06:18 GMT):<br/>
product_format
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:07:00 GMT):<br/>
product_schema_type
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:07:08 GMT):<br/>
product_schema[_spec | _format | _etc]
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:08:21 GMT):<br/>
we should keep schema out of it, as that already has a meaning in the design
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:08:49 GMT):<br/>
I like both spec and format
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:09:28 GMT):<br/>
format probably has a more formal connotation
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:13:17 GMT):<br/>
so, of those, my vote would be for product_spec
</p>
<p><strong>adeebahmed</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:15:38 GMT):<br/>
I had responded on the github thread with the suggestion "product_standard" -- I was considering product_spec, but i feel specifications associated with products may be another concept within supply chains that we may overload with using it here
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:24:42 GMT):<br/>
standard is good too, although not all product thingies might be standards
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:35:07 GMT):<br/>
spec for sure has deeper meaning
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:40:24 GMT):<br/>
i can't get super psyched about any of these really
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:44:34 GMT):<br/>
the intent is to capture the industry standard / spec that the ID and the Properties will conform to
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:44:59 GMT):<br/>
GS1 is a standard and a spec
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:45:45 GMT):<br/>
maybe taking product_ out of the name is good, that way when we use the same concept on Location or whatever it'd be the same field
</p>
<p><strong>adeebahmed</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:48:30 GMT):<br/>
i would opt for "standard" for reuse -- we are using the GS1 standard, but may not be following the exact spec to every detail. In fact it's often the case where we meld the GS1 spec with custom attributes of our own
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:51:27 GMT):<br/>
good take
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:55:25 GMT):<br/>
ok product_standard
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:55:49 GMT):<br/>
i still don't like it as much as i want to but i can't come up with anything i like better 
</p>
<p><strong>mattp</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:06:55 GMT):<br/>
Just a couple more to toss in there:
</p>
<p><strong>mattp</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:07:39 GMT):<br/>
Product_Conformance
Product_Adherence
Product_Alignment
Product_Segment
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:13:52 GMT):<br/>
It should probably be product_namespace given it's meaning in the RFC.
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:17:09 GMT):<br/>
yeah, that's good
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:17:15 GMT):<br/>
specifically, it is there for this purpose: "All Grid addresses are prefixed by the 6-hex-character namespace prefix ‚Äú621dee‚Äù,  Products are further prefixed under the Grid namespace with reserved enumerations of ‚Äú02‚Äù (‚Äú00‚Äù and ‚Äú01‚Äù being reserved for other purposes)
indicating ‚ÄúProducts‚Äù and an additional ‚Äú01‚Äù indicating ‚ÄúGS1 Products‚Äù."
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:17:41 GMT):<br/>
so you need to know GS1 so you can build the address
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 19:18:47 GMT):<br/>
and everything in that product namespace follows rules associated with that style of product storage (such as it's use of schema, addressing, etc.)

Does pike store its data in the same state as grid? In the code I see the namespace for pike is 'cad11d', is that it's own state root hash? I don't see it prepended by '621dee' so it doesn't seem to be a part of grid state. Is that intentional?
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 15:49:15 GMT):<br/>
they are all part of the same state, those are both address prefixes

<p><strong>Gena</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 16:58:06 GMT):<br/>
I would like to understand this more - is there a perceived gap in the GS1 standard for what we are doing here? if so - what is that and can we accommodate somehow in GS1 standards? 
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 14:21:48 GMT):<br/>
i think this is about addressing "custom" or specific fields that a trading partner may require
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 14:23:11 GMT):<br/>
like a company may - and often does - ask for GS1 compliant product data + additional attributes
</p>
<p><strong>Gena</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 15:12:22 GMT):<br/>
ok - great
</p>
<p><strong>Gena</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 15:12:46 GMT):<br/>
so that impacts greatly the design of catalog
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 16:21:48 GMT):<br/>
it may or may not impact the design of catalog - catalog is a collection of products
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 16:23:13 GMT):<br/>
and it's super unlikely that the product attributes would impact the ability of a catalog to 'store' it

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 13 Aug 2019 18:17:32 GMT):<br/>
Someone gave me an interesting idea the other day. An RFC linter. Save as many headaches as possible on RFC process and help focus reviewer feedback on the substance of the idea rather than formatting/spelling/etc. A few things like line length would be easy to flag. Other things I've seen people get caught up on like grammar probably aren't as addressable.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 13 Aug 2019 18:18:53 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>adeebahmed</strong> (Tue, 13 Aug 2019 18:28:36 GMT):<br/>
Yes, a RFC linter that ignores code within backticks would be very nice. Also wrapping sentences from the start of a line, rather than combining them (in the case of bullet points). These are some RFC linting pain points i've experienced
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 13 Aug 2019 20:20:22 GMT):<br/>
I'd write it but it seems really hard. I bet no one on this channel could even create an MVP version.

<p><strong>desktophero</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 13:53:33 GMT):<br/>
I figured I'd raise my comment on the grid primitive (https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-rfcs/pull/4#issuecomment-521243522) RFC here ... the primitive RFC calls out two specific permissions (`can_create_schema` and `can_update_schema`). I'm not clear on the RBAC enforcement model within Grid - either the conceptual thinking around the direction it will go or if there are concrete examples. From an "enterprise" view, these roles would typically be delegated by a separate role that doesn't have permissions to modify schema but does have permissions to apply/remove/enforce those permissions to other roles as well as add agents (people, systems, etc.) to the roles. Any docs/rfcs that folks can point me at around this?

I've looked for existing docs (here in chat, Grid mailing list, internal backlogs) and the closest I've come is finding some callouts on getting a smart permission/identity RFC started. If this isn't already in another person's workload, I'd like to get an RFC started (following the steps in the grid-rfc README). If this is part of an existing work stream, I've love to help contribute.

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 14:09:45 GMT):<br/>
Not sure if this is helpful or not but here's some Pike docs if you haven't already seen those.  https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/sabre/releases/latest/smart_permissions.html

Thanks for the link. I have read through that. I'll circle back on that and see if I can unwrap that a little more. An example of what I'm wondering tied back to [this comment](https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-rfcs/pull/4#issuecomment-521243522) on the Primitives RFC
</p>
<p><strong>desktophero</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 20:40:01 GMT):<br/>
`can_create_schema` is the example permission but not the only sample. This entity needs to have some actions associated with it for the permission to mean anything, right?

hi all - i'll be unavailable for the Design session this afternoon
</p>
<p><strong>adeebahmed</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 20:16:35 GMT):<br/>
Do all catalogs have an expiry date? In the context of Grid as an SDK, i'm debating whether "expiry_date" is a field that should be a "catalog primitive". A Grid catalog (the function of grouping products together) does not _need_ an "expiry_date". A field like that could be enforced by a catalog related schema that requires it in its additional fields, along with say an "effective_date" and whatever else an organization would like to see. 
</p>
<p><strong>adeebahmed</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 20:18:04 GMT):<br/>
I'm thinking of pulling that out of being primitive field -- and providing a schema for catalog that enforces it (as an example). Similar to what i did with catalog_product. 
</p>
<p><strong>adeebahmed</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 20:18:39 GMT):<br/>

#performance-and-scale-wg is in the process of creating a provenance use case to be the driver for objective metrics across dlts. The data model uses GS1 concepts. The preliminary writeup is in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pARtxESnOqQViJabErC5hxFupyfZWCWtOnxsLVtHP4Y/edit?usp=sharing - Would like to find out what the level of GS1 support in Grid.

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 06 Sep 2019 13:04:25 GMT):<br/>
This is still in the initial stages of construction. What did the Oracle team do to build their demo (Grid on Fabric)? since they seemed to have some code for GS1 types. Have they contributed the code back?
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Fri, 06 Sep 2019 14:29:01 GMT):<br/>
they have not contributed the code back - based on the review we saw they implemented a grid inspired set of smart contracts that mimic'd grid/GS1 design
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Fri, 06 Sep 2019 14:29:46 GMT):<br/>
GS1 has day to day involvement in Grid and their resources are probably better positioned to respond to the github/gs1 question

I will take a look at Pike as well since the two sets of Identities being modeled are a. Enterprises (maybe GLN or GLEIF based) (this may be in Pike) b.Products (GTIN) there might be additional types and events we want to model along with EPIC and other GS1 concepts.  Still feeling my way around

Hello!

Are there any roadmap about the development of this project? I am curious, when will the tool support Fabric?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 20 Sep 2019 14:40:28 GMT):<br/>
@Levilk there is not a timeline for Fabric support. many of us are using Sawtooth with PBFT because it is a better fit for our use cases. but from a Grid project perspective, we do want wider DLT support. so, we do have an informal medium/long term plan. the general approach will be to integrate support for Transact (which can run Grid's Sabre contracts) into Fabric. that is a deep platform engineering task (really, between Fabric and Transact). once that is done, then it should be relatively easy to figure out the tasks we need to do as part of Grid. In the short term, as a Grid community we are committed to only include smart contracts that can be run in Transact so we are in-line with this plan.
</p>
<p><strong>MelanieNuce</strong> (Sun, 22 Sep 2019 22:51:18 GMT):<br/>
Team, I uploaded some additional files pertaining to GS1 Location to the Grid Wiki: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/GRID/Uploaded+Files
</p>
<p><strong>MelanieNuce</strong> (Sun, 22 Sep 2019 22:55:20 GMT):<br/>
These include the GS1 Web Vocabulary standard (designed to support web search based on structured data) and the GS1 US Data Hub Location user guide. GS1 US Data Hub is a local tool based on the GS1 Global Location Number standard, with local implementation needs included. The user guide covers the complete experience in the tool, but there is a location data model starting on page 21 - which includes all attributes supported in the tool. As @Gena had previously shared, the EPCIS event visibility data sharing standard also has location (site and sub-site) master data attributes, which are detailed in the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) standard. Both of those were already uploaded to the Wiki by Gena some months ago. We have a new team member that just started two weeks ago, he is going to begin working on pulling together the GS1 Location overview for the RFC immediately. We will keep the team apprised of his progress. He should be on the HL project page and Rocketchat sometime next week. Thanks!

@raph @Patrick-Erichsen  does https://github.com/hyperledger/grid/pull/120 close https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/GRID-99
</p>
<p><strong>Patrick-Erichsen</strong> (Mon, 23 Sep 2019 19:17:11 GMT):<br/>
I don't believe so - https://github.com/hyperledger/grid/pull/120 is to allow for the deletion of a Product, but https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/GRID-99 is to allow for the creation of an empty product list.
</p>
<p><strong>agunde</strong> (Mon, 23 Sep 2019 19:27:27 GMT):<br/>
 I was thinking this bug was created because there was not a way to remove a Product from a ProductList (and reset in state) if ProductList only contained the one product. 120 however implements the correct solution of just deleting the entire product list if it only contains the product being deleted. What are the remaining uses for creating an empty ProductList?
</p>
<p><strong>Patrick-Erichsen</strong> (Mon, 23 Sep 2019 19:31:02 GMT):<br/>
Ah I see what you mean - I don't know to be honest. I just assumed that there was use case for it based on this sentence 

```
Theoretically, we should be able to instantiate an empty ProductList.
```
</p>
<p><strong>Patrick-Erichsen</strong> (Mon, 23 Sep 2019 19:31:54 GMT):<br/>
@raph 
</p>
<p><strong>Patrick-Erichsen</strong> (Mon, 23 Sep 2019 19:42:47 GMT):<br/>
Sounds like Raph created this ticket because while testing it was sort of a pain to need to first create a Product and then add it to a ProductList in order to test the ProductList. So I don't think we have any real-world use case for having an empty ProductList
</p>
<p><strong>Patrick-Erichsen</strong> (Mon, 23 Sep 2019 19:42:54 GMT):<br/>
I think we can close the ticket.

There's a docker-compose file in the root of the repo that will launch a bunch of stuff for you. You can poke into those different components to see what they do or check out the docs: https://grid.hyperledger.org/
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 02 Oct 2019 11:54:05 GMT):<br/>
With your Eth background you might also be interested to dig into the WASM smart contract aspect of grid. You'll see references to `sabre` - that's analogous to the EVM.

Behold this majesty: https://github.com/hyperledger/grid/pull/125
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 09 Oct 2019 21:55:32 GMT):<br/>
So... I compiled grid's pike contract with:

```
rustup update
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 09 Oct 2019 21:55:39 GMT):<br/>
the contract I get is 42MB
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 09 Oct 2019 21:55:48 GMT):<br/>
gzipped its still 7MB
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 09 Oct 2019 21:55:52 GMT):<br/>
am I doing something wrong?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 09 Oct 2019 21:56:06 GMT):<br/>
because this will blow the default 4 MiB limit of GRPC
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 09 Oct 2019 22:00:59 GMT):<br/>
Actually I see that I am pulling this from the target/wasm.../debug directory
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Wed, 09 Oct 2019 22:31:59 GMT):<br/>
After that, did you compile it with `--release`?
</p>
<p><strong>agunde</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 12:47:43 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis From locally testing debug gives me 41M and release is 2.6M. 
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 13:56:36 GMT):<br/>
Here is a guide (draft at the moment) for optimizations of the resulting wasm: https://rustwasm.github.io/book/reference/code-size.html
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 14:16:19 GMT):<br/>
ah thanks... where is the WASM artefact written with --release?
</p>
<p><strong>RobinBanks</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 14:18:38 GMT):<br/>
target/wasm.../release
</p>
<p><strong>RobinBanks</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 14:18:38 GMT):<br/>
target/release
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 14:19:49 GMT):<br/>
yeah sorry just answered my own question, I was in the wrong bit
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 14:19:54 GMT):<br/>
target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/grid-pike-tp.wasm
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 15:48:45 GMT):<br/>
cool... so I can now run these contracts
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 15:48:52 GMT):<br/>
I mean they break
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 15:49:07 GMT):<br/>
Where in sabre can I find the storage function resolvers for WASM?
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 15:53:22 GMT):<br/>
I think they are implemented here: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sabre/blob/master/tp/src/wasm_executor/wasm_externals.rs @RobinBanks can probably provide more details
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 15:53:56 GMT):<br/>
they are wrapped by the sdk as externs https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sabre/blob/master/sdk/src/externs.rs

Hello all and Merry Christmas.  In the spirit of Christmas, I want to share that the current `grid-contrib` and possibly the 'grid' code needs further testing
</p>
<p><strong>RunaStaph</strong> (Wed, 25 Dec 2019 18:24:14 GMT):<br/>
Hello all and Merry Christmas.  Can someone confirm that they have successful built the current grid / grid-contrib code and the demos run smoothly.
</p>
<p><strong>RunaStaph</strong> (Wed, 25 Dec 2019 18:29:14 GMT):<br/>
I have been debugging (and getting to know) the code since last night in an attempt to `1` run the demo, `2` run sample data + seed core types scripts located in the Server folder, Fish Client folder, and Asset Client folder.  I haven't succeed yet.  Suffice to say either I suck (99% chance) or there are errors within the code
</p>
<p><strong>RunaStaph</strong> (Wed, 25 Dec 2019 18:32:49 GMT):<br/>
I will post error messages later if needed.  However, the errors that I have seen so far are simple errors  eg https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-contrib/blob/08c2061ccb5be7fb4e138ada614a4875c9ee98d8/track_and_trace/server/api/agents.js#L26
</p>
<p><strong>RunaStaph</strong> (Wed, 25 Dec 2019 18:34:22 GMT):<br/>
The code:
```javascript
```
</p>
<p><strong>RunaStaph</strong> (Wed, 25 Dec 2019 18:34:22 GMT):<br/>
The code:
```javascript
const fetch = ({ publicKey }) => db.fetch(publicKey, publicKey === authedKey)
```
</p>
<p><strong>RunaStaph</strong> (Wed, 25 Dec 2019 18:36:39 GMT):<br/>
`function is missing the `authedKey` parameter or definition somewhere
</p>
<p><strong>RunaStaph</strong> (Wed, 25 Dec 2019 18:36:39 GMT):<br/>
function is missing the `authedKey` parameter or definition somewhere
</p>
<p><strong>RunaStaph</strong> (Wed, 25 Dec 2019 18:40:26 GMT):<br/>
That one is simple.  My ask for now is that someone confirm that they have successful built the current grid / grid-contrib code and the demos run smoothly
</p>
<p><strong>RunaStaph</strong> (Wed, 25 Dec 2019 18:41:10 GMT):<br/>
Thanks all and tty tomorrow after the Christmas break

@dplumb for your alternatives comment, is that a suggestion that we move that direction in the future, or a statement that it was considered and we agreed we were not going to do it? If it i still up for consideration, that should be made clear in the text, maybe in the unresolved questions section
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Mon, 27 Jan 2020 16:54:46 GMT):<br/>
It is an alternative that I am in favor of moving forward with. However, I'm not requesting that it is changed in the RFC, since I am fairly sure that the implementation described in the RFC is technically correct.
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Mon, 27 Jan 2020 16:55:54 GMT):<br/>
No one else took a position on that issue during FCP, so I am fine with it remaining in the alternative and it can be referred back to if during implementation it seems like it could be a better alternative

Hello! Is there any tutorial of how to use Hyperledger Grid? I do not find anything in the documentations at the website.
</p>
<p><strong>Patrick-Erichsen</strong> (Fri, 31 Jan 2020 16:58:15 GMT):<br/>
The Track and Trace Transaction Family Specification (https://grid.hyperledger.org/docs/grid/nightly/master/transaction_family_specifications/grid_track_and_trace_family_specification.html) would be a good place to see an example.
</p>
<p><strong>lucianosilva44</strong> (Sat, 01 Feb 2020 03:16:03 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, Patrick!!

Other doubt here: trying to build Grid here, but get an error
</p>
<p><strong>lucianosilva44</strong> (Sat, 01 Feb 2020 03:27:37 GMT):<br/>
error: failed to run custom build command for `grid-sdk v0.1.0 
</p>
<p><strong>Patrick-Erichsen</strong> (Sat, 01 Feb 2020 04:19:31 GMT):<br/>
This was the instructions you were following? https://github.com/hyperledger/grid#building-grid

What was the command that you ran that gave you that error?
</p>
<p><strong>lucianosilva44</strong> (Mon, 03 Feb 2020 13:57:36 GMT):<br/>
Yes, those were the instructions. I ran cargo build and then the error appeared.
</p>
<p><strong>lucianosilva44</strong> (Mon, 03 Feb 2020 14:05:57 GMT):<br/>
I had success when building in docker containers. However, don't know how to make them work (which sequence do I have to launch the containers, etc?)
</p>
<p><strong>Patrick-Erichsen</strong> (Mon, 03 Feb 2020 14:48:18 GMT):<br/>
Have you tried `docker compose up` ?
</p>
<p><strong>lucianosilva44</strong> (Mon, 03 Feb 2020 15:26:39 GMT):<br/>
Uh, is there a docker-compose.yaml file in the repo?
</p>
<p><strong>Patrick-Erichsen</strong> (Mon, 03 Feb 2020 15:29:14 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/grid/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>Patrick-Erichsen</strong> (Mon, 03 Feb 2020 15:30:11 GMT):<br/>
There is logic in some of the entrypoints that should bring the network up properly, e.g. https://github.com/hyperledger/grid/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml#L186-L198
</p>
<p><strong>lucianosilva44</strong> (Mon, 03 Feb 2020 17:23:23 GMT):<br/>
Understood
</p>
<p><strong>lucianosilva44</strong> (Mon, 03 Feb 2020 17:37:36 GMT):<br/>
@Patrick-Erichsen , I executed the containers here. However, it only makes a pre-programmed small demonstration of the contracts execution?
</p>
<p><strong>lucianosilva44</strong> (Mon, 03 Feb 2020 17:38:01 GMT):<br/>
Isn't there anything that can be made step-by-step, for better understanding?
</p>
<p><strong>Patrick-Erichsen</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 15:06:51 GMT):<br/>
At the current stage there isn't really much in the sense of tutorials. A lot of the concepts/work on Grid is still evolving, but there are some project examples in https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-contrib

I use docker-compose.yaml from the repo. I use `grid` in grid-cli to add a test organization. But gridd:8080/organization returns an empty array. It's in the `organization` psql table, but filtered out like <https://github.com/hyperledger/grid/blob/master/daemon/src/database/helpers/organizations.rs#L72>. service_id in the db is not null but an empty string. This seems to fix the issue: <https://github.com/yarrkov/grid/commit/9ab52270d415e7112ec719687f5feb15ae86a69e>

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 14:24:41 GMT):<br/>
smart contracts in grid run inside Sawtooth Sabre; the closest thing would be Sabre's AssemblyScript SDK
</p>
<p><strong>shadab14meb346</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 13:53:28 GMT):<br/>
I have few questions. It will be very helpful if I can get these answers or some resources to read from.

1. Why sawtooth was used in place of fabric with grid? 

2. Does the use of sawtooth provides some more features or value over fabric when used in supply chain solutions. If yes what are those? 

3. Is NodeJS SDK support is planned for future?

4. Why RUST was preferred over other more famous languages like GO or Node which is supported in fabric.?

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 15:04:00 GMT):<br/>
@shadab14meb346 1) Grid supports both Sawtooth and Splinter (https://www.splinter.dev/), both of which are committed to running smart contracts with Hyperledger Transact, which is how we run WASM contracts in Sabre. These platforms are distributed, which make them suitable for the types of patterns we need in supply chain. Where they are deficient, we are actively changing them to be more suitable for Grid. 2) Architecture primarily. I don't want to get into all Fabric's disadvantages here, but lack of support for Transact and its centralized architecture; 3) Not NodeJS specifically, but Javascript smart contracts are definitely something we are interested in adding (thus why we explored AssemblyScript), either within Sabre or as another smart contract engine that runs in Transact. We will keep with on-chain smart contracts, because any other model has administration issues. 4) From a platform perspective, we are using Rust because its the perfect programming language for what we are doing. Besides the language being great, the ecosystem and libraries are excellent. Platforms written in Go are kind of legacy, like COBOL. And Node is Javascript, which is maybe the worst of everything for systems programming problems. However, if you mean for smart contracts specifically -- we are really focused on WASM, not Rust. Rust has the best support for compiling into WASM with relatively small resulting binaries. Adding Go smart contract SDK to Sabre is certainly possible, but the resulting WASM binaries would be relatively large due to Go's runtime. Javascript is actually very interesting for smart contracts though (as long as it is on-chain).

Did you update both the sawtooth validator image to 1.2 as well as the devmode consensus image?
</p>
<p><strong>prem-baranwal</strong> (Tue, 21 Jul 2020 12:00:05 GMT):<br/>
yes. in fact i did it for settings-tp and shell images as well.
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Tue, 21 Jul 2020 13:36:53 GMT):<br/>
Based on your followup email, the Sawtooth REST API needs an update, as well.
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Tue, 21 Jul 2020 14:02:52 GMT):<br/>
There are a couple of minor updates that are needed to the grid daemon to work with sawtooth 1.2.  I will (hopefully) get a PR up shortly.
</p>
<p><strong>prem-baranwal</strong> (Thu, 23 Jul 2020 05:40:42 GMT):<br/>
That would be really helpful. I looked at the code and it looks like the PING_REQUEST from validator need to be handled. Instead of throwing error and exiting, it should respond with PING_RESPONSE. Let me know if there is more to it.

AssetClient/FishClient mention pike version as 0.4 while creating transactions where as the latest sabre-tp is processing 0.5 only.

I've read all the documentation of grid, is amazing what you've done!
I want to know, do you recommend me use grid to make traceability for products on  a production system?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Aug 2020 18:45:36 GMT):<br/>
@hidura welcome! we are going to do a community meeting soon, just working on a date for that. we will post that information here.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Aug 2020 18:48:27 GMT):<br/>
the "Product" capability in grid is for sharing GS1-based product definitions between companies. There is a location RFC that is being worked on (https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-rfcs/blob/69e84bdc4bee7a75455557221b207055b0c25e81/text/0000-location.md) that will provide very similar capability for sharing GS1-based locations between companies.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Aug 2020 18:54:16 GMT):<br/>
the track-and-trace functionality built into Grid pre-dates our focus on GS1 standards, so one of the TODO items there is to modify it to integrate nicely with both Product and Location. some of the track-and-trace code is in grid proper, and some of it is in grid-contrib. the pieces in grid-contrib are there because they need to be update and/or rewritten in order to make it in the grid codebase. for example, we need to update the state-delta-export feature to a Rust implementation so it can run inside gridd. That is open to anyone that wants to work on it. Another TODO there is to take a careful look at GS1 standards and see how we should modify track-and-trace to be more in-line with how it works in those standards.

hi @JessieZamzow
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Aug 2020 19:08:24 GMT):<br/>
do we have a date we would like to set as a goal for calling FCP (final comment period) for the location RFC?
</p>
<p><strong>JessieZamzow</strong> (Wed, 12 Aug 2020 19:13:28 GMT):<br/>
Would it be fair to set a goal of Friday (8/14) to begin the final calling period? How long does that calling period last? My thought process is I could push a commit with updates tonight, folks can resolve comments tomorrow (and into FCP), and then allow final comments off the cleaner version. Thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Wed, 12 Aug 2020 21:50:45 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @amundson I am looking to use grid on my market due to the grid adaptation to that area, then only thing is I can't find a way to start, because there's some areas that I don't understand
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Wed, 12 Aug 2020 21:52:23 GMT):<br/>
Like how I can interact to create agents, products, schemas on grid is via CLI or is there any library?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 13 Aug 2020 13:34:45 GMT):<br/>
@JessieZamzow FCP lasts a week. We will want votes from two subteams, the core subteam and the gs1 subteam. Prior to the vote, we need both subteam members to provide their input. The subteams members are here: https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-rfcs/tree/master/subteams
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 13 Aug 2020 13:39:01 GMT):<br/>
core subteam - @adeebahmed @agunde @dplumb @jsmitchell @desktophero @pschwarz and gs1 subteam @adeebahmed @cecchi  @Gena @jsmitchell @mattp @MelanieNuce - please finish your review of the location RFC - https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-rfcs/pull/20
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 13 Aug 2020 13:39:50 GMT):<br/>
others that are not on subteams - please also get your reviews and comments in on the RFC
</p>
<p><strong>MelanieNuce</strong> (Thu, 13 Aug 2020 16:28:52 GMT):<br/>
@mattp based on your question on the Location RFC, API access to GS1 US Data Hub is $6500/year in addition to the $500/year subscription to Company data. Location and Product data are each an additional $500/yr, but the API subscription is good across all three levels.
</p>
<p><strong>MelanieNuce</strong> (Thu, 13 Aug 2020 16:30:53 GMT):<br/>
@amundson and @JessieZamzow I think the GS1 contributions are completed, unless there are open questions from others that require more changes to the RFC. If you can tag us or let me know what still requires GS1 support, I will make sure we complete those items. Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>mattp</strong> (Thu, 13 Aug 2020 17:17:59 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @MelanieNuce, this is helpful.  @cecchi Do you think the design is in line with each developing party requiring us to get access here?  Said differently, 1) Is API access to the GS1 US data hub required?  2) Assuming so, is each developing and contributing party required to get access?  3) If access to the GS1 US data hub is not required, how else do we intend to validate company data as suggested in the RFC?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 13 Aug 2020 19:32:54 GMT):<br/>
@mattp The RFC does not cover integration with any existing system. Is your question more about whether GLNs are the right identifiers to use for locations? If so, there is identifier space "reserved" in the RFC for additional identification schemes (this is what LocationNamespace is about). This is the identical approach we took with GS1 product support, where there is namespace reserved if GTIN is not the desired product identifier.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 13 Aug 2020 19:33:39 GMT):<br/>
@MelanieNuce thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>mattp</strong> (Thu, 13 Aug 2020 20:21:19 GMT):<br/>
Hi Shawn, thanks for your reply.  My question is not about GLN being the right identifier to use for location.  Given the broader use and standards already existing about them, I think it makes sense.  My question is more about identity management and ensuring those inputting and asserting product data are correct.  After reading James' response in the thread, it seemed to indicate linking a GS1 prefix to pike orgs with a transaction signed by the appropriate GS1 identity for this purpose, but maybe that serves a different purpose.  My original question was this:  Is the intent to validate the GLN input with GS1? Wondering if there is a need to validate the input is coming from the correct GS1 company prefix and those who are associated with it, from a GS1 perspective. I think stated differently, is how do we ensure bad actors are ruled out and not allowed to input false or misleading data if they simply use a valid GS1 company prefix and the check digit format is correct as part of the GLN?
</p>
<p><strong>mattp</strong> (Thu, 13 Aug 2020 20:25:10 GMT):<br/>
It seemed like the what was being suggested and natural way to do this would be to validate the GLN and related organizational identity via the GS1 US data hub API, but maybe thats not possible or desired here?

<p><strong>agunde</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 14:10:08 GMT):<br/>
@hidura If you are using the grid docker-compose.yaml file to start all of grid, that is not an error. Those containers compile the smart contracts into wasm and then submit the required transactions to Sabre to  make the smart contracts available. You should see a log that looks like `---------========= track and trace contract is loaded =========---------` and then the container exists.
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 14:11:28 GMT):<br/>
Ok, thanks, with this up I can start using the grid-cli?
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 14:11:48 GMT):<br/>
Because my main goal is to use the cli directly
</p>
<p><strong>agunde</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 14:15:21 GMT):<br/>
Yes, you should be able to
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 14:20:08 GMT):<br/>
Excellent! Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 18:22:14 GMT):<br/>
I suggest we put together a Grid community call for Aug 21st at 10am US/Central. Will that work for most people?
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 18:48:20 GMT):<br/>
Agree
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 22:33:12 GMT):<br/>
I wish to add Python support to the gid-cli, I'll be starting doing it, because due the small span of time, is impossible to learn rust and add do all the system on grid.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 22:53:51 GMT):<br/>
@hidura I assume you mean calling into a python interpreter from the Rust code. That isn't desirable as it would substantially raise the effort to maintain the code. we have a mixed python/rust codebase in Sawtooth and our #1 goal is to finish the python->rust transition and purge all the Python code. While most of us like both Rust and Python, there are some very big negatives to combining them.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 22:54:40 GMT):<br/>
Python tools are welcome in grid-contrib though
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 22:55:14 GMT):<br/>
So, to interact with the grid-cli, what you recommend me?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 22:57:07 GMT):<br/>
If you are adding a subcommand to the grid cli, it should be implemented in Rust.
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 22:58:02 GMT):<br/>
Ok, I'll not add any subcommand, my goal is to interact with the grid
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 22:58:32 GMT):<br/>
I'll be creating my code in Python, to interact via command line with grid-cli
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 22:58:50 GMT):<br/>
Can you elaborate?
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 23:01:58 GMT):<br/>
I'll have my python flask webapp that will interact with the grid-cli, as for example a organization register, I'll be calling from python the grid cli command on bash(this is how I understand the grid-cli works): 
```
grid organization create <org_id> <org_name> <address>
```
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 23:04:29 GMT):<br/>
ah, ok. you could make calls directly to the REST API as well if you wanted (this is what the grid CLI does)
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 23:06:08 GMT):<br/>
Ok, I can use that and send the same protos message as the cli does.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 23:06:12 GMT):<br/>
is this a javascript app calling into python flask webapp?
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 23:07:04 GMT):<br/>
Will be a Python/Flask mainly because we'll be allowing companies to connect to the API
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 23:07:37 GMT):<br/>
As probably will be added some goverment organizations and regular people with an Javascript App that will be provide for the end user
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 23:07:57 GMT):<br/>
if you are doing any javascript, you may find this interesting - https://github.com/hyperledger/grid/tree/master/grid-ui
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 23:09:00 GMT):<br/>
what authentication/authorization are you planning to implement?
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 23:09:06 GMT):<br/>
I was trying to using it, but it always give me an error
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 23:10:35 GMT):<br/>
A descentralized market, that will allow the producers(mostly farmers), to have their information on a Blockchain and will give the goverment the capacity to give them the permissions that they need so they can export easly
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 23:10:38 GMT):<br/>
there are folks on this channel that will definitely help you get past that error
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 23:10:48 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>RyanBanks</strong> (Mon, 17 Aug 2020 14:54:08 GMT):<br/>
@hidura it looks like the port is wrong. Assuming you're using the docker-compose in the grid repo the grid daemon is bound to port 8080.

API access to the GS1 US Data Hub is not required by this RFC, no.
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Mon, 17 Aug 2020 15:43:31 GMT):<br/>
the owner of the GPC will submit their GLN data to Grid.  There can be structural validation of the data, obvs, but there are no plans for additional "calls to GS1" to validate that it matches what is in DataHub or anything.  This would be true for other GS1 data objects as well.
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Mon, 17 Aug 2020 15:43:50 GMT):<br/>
that could be done as part of SDE processing locally

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 28 Aug 2020 14:16:57 GMT):<br/>
@Nandhitharamalingam can you provide the sequence you are going through up to that point? you mentioned track and trace but that's not related to product (they are separate smart contracts, etc.)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 28 Aug 2020 14:20:45 GMT):<br/>
@Radhai Grid works on top of either Sawtooth or Splinter. The docs are lacking for running it on top of Sawtooth, but yes, some of the docker compose files are setup that way (you can look at the compose file and determine this by whether its running a sawtooth validator). Here are some Splinter-specific instructions - https://grid.hyperledger.org/docs/0.1/grid_on_splinter.html. (Having a doc like this for Sawtooth would be great too, just hasn't been written in the same way yet.)

Hi, I need to use Track & Trace contract. But I dont see any option to create record in grid cli. How can i use that ? any sample example example for creating record ?

Hi @amundson , Is there any option in the grid cli to create record ,proposal  for grid's track and trace contract as per https://grid.hyperledger.org/docs/0.1/grid_track_and_trace_family_specification.html .

Hmm looks like there isn't currently CLI functionality in Grid for Track and Trace. The implementation would be very similar to the existing CLI functionality. Theres an example of creating transactions for it in the track and trace examples in Grid Contrib repo. This is for Sawtooth however, I don't believe those apps have been updated to be used with Splinter yet.

How can I execute a transaction in xo constract from `scabbard` in the basic read the docs tutorial?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 16 Oct 2020 16:40:28 GMT):<br/>
which tutorial?
</p>
<p><strong>aditya520</strong> (Fri, 16 Oct 2020 16:41:05 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>aditya520</strong> (Fri, 16 Oct 2020 16:41:27 GMT):<br/>
After completing this, I want to execute a transaction, how can I do that?
</p>
<p><strong>aditya520</strong> (Fri, 16 Oct 2020 16:41:58 GMT):<br/>
`scabbard exec --contract sawtooth_xo:1.0 --inputs 5b7349 --outputs 5b7349 --payload "xo create" --service-id $CIRCUIT_ID::gsBB --key 036c875f611922d94281b0132203ef38d376b5ac3ba14394a995f69d803c3f3562` This is not working!
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 16 Oct 2020 16:58:14 GMT):<br/>
you are on the right track but you have to generate a payload file (--payload takes a filename) -- https://www.splinter.dev/docs/0.4/references/cli/scabbard-exec.1.html
</p>
<p><strong>aditya520</strong> (Fri, 16 Oct 2020 16:59:18 GMT):<br/>
And how do I do that?
</p>
<p><strong>ltseeley</strong> (Fri, 16 Oct 2020 17:18:12 GMT):<br/>
@aditya520 as @amundson mentioned, you'll need to write the payload to a file. This payload file will look different for each smart contract. For the `sawtooth_xo` smart contract, it's pretty simple. You can see the description of the different payload options here: https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/transaction_family_specifications/xo_transaction_family.html#transaction-payload
</p>
<p><strong>ltseeley</strong> (Fri, 16 Oct 2020 17:19:22 GMT):<br/>
So to create a new xo game called "my_game", you'd write the string `my_game,create` to a file, then use that file like `scabbard exec ... --payload /path/to/payload/file`
</p>

many of us are using splinter a lot, but we are adding some grid-on-sawtooth docs too, so I'm curious if this would actually occur with that flow. that work is here - https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-docs/pull/158
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Mon, 02 Nov 2020 19:29:33 GMT):<br/>
Hello @amundson I'd took the protos message and doing it with Python to adapt it to my company needs, probably I'll be porting all the code from rust to python due that I was unable to use splinter or the core.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 02 Nov 2020 20:50:24 GMT):<br/>
I'm not following
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Mon, 02 Nov 2020 22:59:48 GMT):<br/>
I'd have to many problems to make grid work, specially the grid-cli and the validator.
So at the end I took the protos file, and start writing the grid-cli using python and is working right now. 
I want to know the state of grid because I'd ask some question recently and nobody answer so I tought it was over.

answers can be hard to provide without enough context to recreate the issue (traceback is great, but its not enough unless someone has already run into it), and everyone is busy coding as well. you can view the project board if you want to know on what -- https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/projects/1

Sorry for the lack of response @hidura , as @amundson  mentioned we have been super busy with the 0.1 release. Btw, there is some updated documentation and an example for running Grid on Sawtooth coming soon that is currently in PR form. You can check it out on the Grid repo if you're interested in reviewing it or getting a preview: https://github.com/hyperledger/grid/pull/397

Hi, Tom Klein here.  I co-chair the https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/SCSIG/Supply+Chain+SIG .  We have an opening this coming Thursday, Feb 4, on our regular call and I'd like to give Grid the hour if somebody would like to present. Usually 20-30 minutes of pres at a mostly business level and then the rest questions.  Definitely would like to help start some cross-pollination.  You can contact me at tkklein100@gmail.com if this could work.

hi all - apologies if im posting this question on the wrong channel, but I'm running into an issue while running the grid/splinter example using the docker-compose command. I'm using the docker-compose command specified on the docs to deploy the test network with all Splinter artifacts, but its failing when trying to build the Pike's image. Error says that it was caused by... "Error parsing major identifier for key `package.version`. I checked the Cargo.toml file on Pike's folder and I see the version as "0.2.1". I did a "Git Pull" before running the docker compose build command as well as the docker-compose command to make sure I'm using up-to-date images. Any guidance to get this fix?
</p>
<p><strong>RobinBanks</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 18:43:34 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>carlo.burgos</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 19:33:51 GMT):<br/>
The command I'm running is: `docker-compose -f examples/splinter/docker-compose.yaml build --pull`
</p>
<p><strong>carlo.burgos</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 19:34:37 GMT):<br/>
Let me know if you need any other info
</p>
<p><strong>RobinBanks</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 20:02:48 GMT):<br/>
Thanks! The issue is that the `REPO_VERSION` environment variable is not set. It should build if you run
```
$ docker-compose -f examples/splinter/docker-compose.yaml up --build
```
This should build the images and set that value correctly
</p>
<p><strong>carlo.burgos</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 20:55:14 GMT):<br/>
ok well i can see that the docker-compose file `example/splinter/docker-compose.yaml` defines the REPO_VERSION as part of the "args" section within the build block, shouldn't that set it as an environment variable?
</p>
<p><strong>carlo.burgos</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 20:55:14 GMT):<br/>
ok well i can see that the docker-compose file `example/splinter/docker-compose.yaml` defines the REPO_VERSION as part of the "args" section within the build block, so it should be available during build, right?
</p>
<p><strong>RobinBanks</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 21:13:37 GMT):<br/>
Right, so running `docker-compose up --build` flag should work
</p>
<p><strong>carlo.burgos</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 21:19:35 GMT):<br/>
i think the variable substitution is not working when running that docker-compose command from the root directory, but referencing a docker-compose file on a sub-directory. I checked the docker-compose file using the "config" option and the ${REPO_VERSION} is coming up blank. I think is because the .env file on the root directory is not getting properly scoped. It does get set if the .env file is stored on the examples/splinter sub-directory.
</p>
<p><strong>carlo.burgos</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 21:23:03 GMT):<br/>
i've had this issue before and ended up mitigating it via a central shell script at root that first loads the env variables from a targeted .env, then proceeds with docker commands
</p>
<p><strong>carlo.burgos</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 21:31:51 GMT):<br/>
anyway... Thank you so much for the help and the quick responses! Please let me know if you need me to document this anywhere.
</p>
<p><strong>RobinBanks</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 21:53:08 GMT):<br/>
No problem! Unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt able to reproduce you‚Äôre issue locally, and I managed to build everything with the default .env at root. If you‚Äôd like, could you create an issue in the grid repo detailing the bug with the version of docker and the OS you‚Äôre using?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 17:34:54 GMT):<br/>
@amundson I don't know if you've seen this: https://www.zenhub.com/ it plugs into GitHub issues directly. Cactus is using it.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 19:03:44 GMT):<br/>
last time we looked at zenhub for public projects, it required giving fully permissions for all repos (public and private) to zenhub, which is a complete show-stopper
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 19:03:58 GMT):<br/>
it is otherwise quite nice
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 19:05:20 GMT):<br/>
its like 90% the same as github projects
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 21:54:25 GMT):<br/>
oh, yikes. That's a limitation of GitHub - which I have complained about as often as I can

it might be good to explicitly lock that contrib code to grid 0.1
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Wed, 03 Mar 2021 22:18:19 GMT):<br/>
Hmm I was able to repro that error. Not entirely sure what the issue is with some minimal debugging but I will log a bug for it in the development board. We should definitely get that locked to a released version (I think we will have to release an experimental Grid 0.1 artifact for it since track and trace is experimental)
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Wed, 03 Mar 2021 22:20:52 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Mon, 08 Mar 2021 18:21:03 GMT):<br/>
Hey zoup, you can find the REST API docs for 0.2.0 at https://grid.hyperledger.org/docs/0.2/api/ (to find this, go to the docs site, switch the version in the sidebar to 0.2, and find Grid REST API at the bottom). There are no docs for 0.2.1 at the moment since 0.2 is the main development branch and hasnt been released yet.

Hello All, I am very new to Hyperledger Grid.  Pardon my naive question: Does Grid work on Hyperledger Fabric or is it at the moment restricted to Sawtooth and Splinter? Any plans to make it work on Fabric soon?  Thanks for your time.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 18 Mar 2021 15:21:44 GMT):<br/>
@rdeshmukh73 no current plans; Grid supports platforms using Hyperledger Transact, so it is really a question of Fabric support for Transact which AFAIK is not currently being worked on.

<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 12:10:18 GMT):<br/>
thanks again!
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 12:10:40 GMT):<br/>
btw our project info is at http://blockchainlab.lu/medlogistics/
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 14 May 2021 13:47:19 GMT):<br/>
@zoup can you explain a little bit about what you were doing that led up to this? i.e. what transactions, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Fri, 14 May 2021 14:44:35 GMT):<br/>
With pleasure, thank you for getting back to me!

Basically, we do this over a CI/CD test system where we create an organization, a role with all permissions, allocating that role to the user, creating a custom location schema (based on grid test yamls) generating GLN based on companies prefix + checkdigit and then try to create that location via CLI with the permission of the user we just created
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Fri, 14 May 2021 14:44:41 GMT):<br/>
basically, we run cli all over
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Fri, 14 May 2021 14:45:01 GMT):<br/>
above is of course for grid 0.2, but same exact end-result (trap exception) happened with 0.1
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Fri, 14 May 2021 14:46:31 GMT):<br/>
at the moment i can share anything that you need, if it's db dumps, yaml files, even source codes, that's certainly shareable as we are planning to opensource it anyway
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Fri, 14 May 2021 14:58:40 GMT):<br/>
Hmm interesting! If you have the yaml files you are using to define the custom location schema and the command you are using to create the location, I can try to reproduce it
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Fri, 14 May 2021 16:29:03 GMT):<br/>
Will definitely dig them up and share with you!
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Fri, 14 May 2021 21:31:21 GMT):<br/>
Hi Again! updated the issue with a list of all commands, parameters, stdout and stderr, as well as yaml files

@zoup I responded to you in your issue
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 16:43:04 GMT):<br/>
Welcome @slim-patchy !
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 18:03:46 GMT):<br/>
@dplumb Thank you very much! will try them out and get back to you!
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 18:32:42 GMT):<br/>
You're welcome! The example I provided is for the dev branch, so if you are using 0.1 you will need slightly different commands. Not sure which version you're targeting
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 18:36:17 GMT):<br/>
actually running this on 0.2
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 18:39:37 GMT):<br/>
hmm, excluding --metadata on organization create, i can't find any difference between my commands and 0.2 docs...
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 18:39:57 GMT):<br/>
either case, removed --metadata, still getting the same exception..
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 18:51:58 GMT):<br/>
can you please share your schema and location yamls?
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 18:52:49 GMT):<br/>
maybe there is something wrong with those? because the one in the cli/tests/locations/ are not working as well (missing owner field)
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 21:07:52 GMT):<br/>
That is odd. I downloaded the schema and location yaml that you had linked in the issue
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 23:46:39 GMT):<br/>
ah, note that create location cli actually returns 0, whatever's the input grid cli is happy with it
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 23:46:53 GMT):<br/>
the exception thing happens at the sawtooth level
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 23:50:51 GMT):<br/>
on your test, did the location actually got created?
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:14:04 GMT):<br/>
Yes, in my testing they did get created. How recently did you set up your containers? There were some changes on main to Pike addressing that may have impacted this, but that was quite a few weeks ago.
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:14:09 GMT):<br/>
Ill take another look at it tomorrow
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:16:41 GMT):<br/>
Thanks! i'm actually running this via docker-compose -f examples/sawtooth/docker-compose.yaml build --pull and up
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:16:48 GMT):<br/>
not sure if that's the best approach...
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:17:06 GMT):<br/>
and on master
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:21:56 GMT):<br/>
Oh you are using sawtooth. Ok I was using splinter when I tried to reproduce it
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:22:53 GMT):<br/>
Yes it's sawtooth,  but which is more stable in term of using for production between sawtooth and splinter?
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:23:24 GMT):<br/>
i think you guys mainly use splinter for development right? judging by docs and comments here and there...
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:37:01 GMT):<br/>
which one to use really comes down to your use case; splinter's scabbard ledger currently supports 2-3 nodes using 2-phase-commit and isn't technically a blockchain
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:37:36 GMT):<br/>
sawtooth w/pbft is 5+ nodes all with a shared state
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:38:49 GMT):<br/>
long-term roadmap, splinter will be the underlying network layer for sawtooth 2
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:39:09 GMT):<br/>
so a lot of our energy goes there
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:39:15 GMT):<br/>
Hi @amundson, my first concern is stability in terms of how well grid works with either of them
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:41:51 GMT):<br/>
Splinter's longer term plan works for us as well, hopefully we can help with that process
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:42:00 GMT):<br/>
most of the developers use splinter daily and we test out sawtooth when we do releases, so I guess to some extent splinter?
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:42:36 GMT):<br/>
Understood
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:42:54 GMT):<br/>
but we do intend it to work on both, so I'm just speaking from a practical perspective not a goal perspective
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:48:46 GMT):<br/>
as we are approaching the 0.2 release, it is on the todo to run through all the docs and re-test for regressions -- I think maybe you are a couple weeks ahead of us, so this is definitely something we are currently interested in understanding and fixing
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:50:41 GMT):<br/>
that's perfectly fine, we are planning to help with splinter/grid development as well
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:50:59 GMT):<br/>
i actually explained what we are trying to achieve with grid a while ago
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:51:16 GMT):<br/>
it might be useful to create a bug issue for this to help track it
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:51:30 GMT):<br/>
we are basically a luxembourg based company, partnered up with a number of hospitals around the Europe
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:51:38 GMT):<br/>
that would be great!
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:51:53 GMT):<br/>
our product, VeriBlok is basically a logistics management system specialized for medical devices
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:52:17 GMT):<br/>
we started just 3 months ago, so, relatively new
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:55:35 GMT):<br/>
there is a medical device company here in minneapolis called medtronic
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:56:32 GMT):<br/>
I heard some stories about devices they make being delivered as-needed quickly in trunks of cars and it being a hard problem to keep track of everything accurately
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:57:00 GMT):<br/>
Yes, Masks, Vaccines, those stuff are critical at this point
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:57:40 GMT):<br/>
long story short, turns out the entire EU has no real way to verify the authenticity of a product
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:58:19 GMT):<br/>
and the whole COVID crisis just made that worst, a hospital which purchased 3000 masks per "year" had to suddenly buy 6000 per day
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 19:59:35 GMT):<br/>
presumably some of that specific example has started to be worked out at this point?
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 20:00:35 GMT):<br/>
They really couldn't fix the problem but find a way around it
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 20:01:59 GMT):<br/>
what's your vision of a solution?
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 20:03:02 GMT):<br/>
basically a platform that contain both labs (who certify the product as well as raw material) as well as purchaser/manufacturers
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 20:03:21 GMT):<br/>
sending the deck to your PM (Sorry can't share publicly at this point)
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 15:30:13 GMT):<br/>
@zoup I was able to repro your error on Sawtooth, so likely a regression. We will look into that
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 15:42:00 GMT):<br/>
@dplumb Thanks, node that it happens on 0.1 as well
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 15:42:00 GMT):<br/>
@dplumb Thanks, note that it happens on 0.1 as well

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/grid?msg=gZeEgmcSdjWBAxyQ9) by the looks of it you either haven't generated keys at all, lack env variables, or stored somewhere grid can't find
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Fri, 11 Jun 2021 08:50:48 GMT):<br/>
easiest to just generate key and pass --key to grid so it can find them out :)

I have used echo "{PublicKey}" > gridd.pub command.
Is there any other command I need to use to generate Key.
Please suggest, still stuck on same point .
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Fri, 11 Jun 2021 16:39:36 GMT):<br/>
We had a change on the development branch (main) which may not be reflected in the docs yet
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Fri, 11 Jun 2021 16:57:22 GMT):<br/>
For now you should be able to pass --key as @zoup  said, or set `CYLINDER_PATH` env var to the location of your key
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/grid?msg=3hSp4hHNoeh5GrPqo) Hi dplump,
Thank you for reply.
Please provide the command, as you mentioned it is not available in docs.
</p>
<p><strong>zoup</strong> (Sat, 12 Jun 2021 07:35:31 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/grid?msg=vmbQBhsyuPGaHZvvX) it really isn't a command, it's just a parameter, --key as @dplumb said

Hello. New to Grid and Hyperledger in general. I'm not sure if this is a bug or not. 
Running the following, I was thinking that roles would be "reset" to whatever `--role` args were passed in. Instead, they are appended:
`grid agent update a1 023a706934e3be6eb624f74a687e4bb2687238ab84440d1e2197d8a81a65b3ad63 --active --role "admin" --role "product-admin"`

Hello New to Grid , i'm trying the sample for sawtooth but when i try to create an organisation 
`grid organization create 000000001 sept_cinquante  --metadata gs1_company_prefixes=SC_01` in alpha container 
i have an error : http://gridd-alpha:8080/batches: error trying to connect: Connection refused (os error 111)

thanks for help

<p><strong>tim-trutech</strong> (Fri, 23 Jul 2021 04:18:03 GMT):<br/>
Hi @septcinquante. Where are you running the command from? Can you resolve the name gridd-alpha via DNS? If you're in the gridd-alpha container itself, can you access http://localhost:8080?
</p>
<p><strong>septcinquante</strong> (Fri, 23 Jul 2021 15:38:12 GMT):<br/>
Hi from the container alpha himself
</p>
<p><strong>septcinquante</strong> (Fri, 23 Jul 2021 15:38:12 GMT):<br/>
Hi from the container alpha itself
</p>
<p><strong>tim-trutech</strong> (Fri, 23 Jul 2021 18:58:34 GMT):<br/>
@septcinquante I'm guessing it's a DNS/resolution issue. Can you access http://localhost:8080/batches from within the container?
</p>
<p><strong>septcinquante</strong> (Mon, 26 Jul 2021 12:34:44 GMT):<br/>
your right , when i use wget inside the container , i have ```

Hello everyone,

I am a student in my last few months and I am trying to make a POC of a Hyperledger Grid solution.

I am following the following tutorial: 

https://grid.hyperledger.org/docs/0.1/grid_on_splinter.html

However... I get the following issue when trying to run the following docker command:

docker-compose -f examples/splinter/docker-compose.yaml build --pull
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Thu, 29 Jul 2021 08:11:19 GMT):<br/>
I tried it with Splinter and with Sawtooth.

I am on Windows 10 Enterprise, WSL 2 with Ubuntu 20.04.
</p>
<p><strong>tim-trutech</strong> (Mon, 02 Aug 2021 04:55:00 GMT):<br/>
I received this error if I used the downloadable zip file. If I did a git clone, the error went away.
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Mon, 02 Aug 2021 10:15:45 GMT):<br/>
Hi!

I also did that. And now I have a new error
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Mon, 02 Aug 2021 10:16:16 GMT):<br/>

@LeslytH Some of the containers are excepted to shutdown when they are done. For example the builder and generate-registry shutdown once they are done.
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 20:07:42 GMT):<br/>
which version of Grid are you using @LeslytH  ?
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 20:08:33 GMT):<br/>
If you are trying to just execute the example commands, you can exec into the gridd-alpha container and run the CLI commands from there. Before you go through the example make sure you select the version of grid that you're using from the sidebar of the docs
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 20:38:52 GMT):<br/>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/grid?msg=Sz788GqZDNSixigam) I am following https://grid.hyperledger.org/docs/0.2/grid_on_splinter.html

</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 20:41:44 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/grid?msg=Sz788GqZDNSixigam) I can do this eventually untill the point I want to create a Schema.

At that point after I copy the example schema to the node it says that the batch is succesfully submitted with a long code.

But when using the command to show the Schema nothing is there.

When I look at my Docker setup the Schema builder Node is offline
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 20:43:01 GMT):<br/>
But I am curious. What are other people using as a base os?

Is anyone having succes with WSL and ubuntu 20.04? Or are people using Ubuntu 20.04 (VM)?

<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Fri, 06 Aug 2021 15:54:58 GMT):<br/>
When you submit the transaction you'll either see that the transaction was successful and the grid daemon added it to the database, or youll see an invalid transaction log with the reason why the transaction may have failed
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Fri, 06 Aug 2021 15:55:21 GMT):<br/>
that doesnt get reported back to the CLI at the moment

<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Wed, 11 Aug 2021 15:26:14 GMT):<br/>
0.3 from Grid
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Wed, 11 Aug 2021 15:27:12 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Thu, 12 Aug 2021 12:52:31 GMT):<br/>

okay it works again
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Fri, 13 Aug 2021 13:04:39 GMT):<br/>
Okay, I finally have a decent grasp of hyperledger Grid.

However to make my PoC a succes I have to implement the following things in my PoC

is it *now* possible to change product data from other organizations? 
Is it possible to have a kind of versioning of changing productdata?

For example Product A with owner OrgA has description A.

But orgB changes the description to description B.

Is it possible to have an overview of version 1 (Original product) and version 2 (changed product)?

Something similar like https://prod.etim-international.com/Class/Compare?classIdLeft=EC000001&classVersionLeft=5&classIdRight=EC000001&classVersionRight=4

I see something in the REST API about batches. What are they? Is it possible to look at the history of products? As in version 1 like in my example?

Also lastly, How do i export the products to the postgres database?
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Fri, 13 Aug 2021 13:05:12 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Mon, 16 Aug 2021 13:30:28 GMT):<br/>
How do you use the delegation of roles in an organization?

How to make a smart contract is really difficult for me. There is not a lot of information how to effectively add funcitons to a smart cotnract.
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Mon, 16 Aug 2021 14:30:37 GMT):<br/>
Or how to make a whole new smart contract for that matter.
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Mon, 16 Aug 2021 18:38:36 GMT):<br/>
> is it now possible to change product data from other organizations? 
Yes this is possible. Org A will make a new role with the `product::can-update-product` role and add Org B to the `allowed_organizations` field. Then org B can create a new role with the role name of the role that Org A created in the `inherits_from` field. Example of that here: https://grid.hyperledger.org/docs/0.3/using_pike.html
> Is it possible to have a kind of versioning of changing productdata?
Currently theres no versioning of product data in Grid Product.

</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Mon, 16 Aug 2021 21:46:44 GMT):<br/>
Tnt smart contract and work with timestamping new properties instead of ownership of the product? That way it is somewhat similar to versioning

i'm testing grid with this schema 
` name: gs1_product3
  description: GS1 product schema
  owner: septCinquante
  properties:
     - name: GDSN_3_1
       data_type: STRING
       description: str containing GDSN 3.1 Trade Item product definition in XML
       required: true`
Now how to write a product file, there is directly the posibility to add product in CLI without file ?
thanks for your help

<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 06:34:10 GMT):<br/>
And about adding a product directly without using a file.

i think you want to make a new file instead of import a file from outside the gridd nodes right?
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 06:37:46 GMT):<br/>
IIRC you can not make a new files in those docker machines.

But if you want to make a new file in Linux/ubuntu you could use the following command:

sudo nano new_Product_Name.xml

This makes a new file in Linux wherein you can add the properties.

But I would use the product.xml as a template and continue with that. 

Or make your own custom schema wherein the most important GDSN product data is also in there.
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 06:41:20 GMT):<br/>
And make a .YAML product

I will study this. 
Just a confirmation, the  schema is the template for a product so my product.xml must match exactly my schema isn't it ?
From my shema (see prev post )  how to create products ? 
Sorry i'm a newbies , i'm not yet ready with grid

Hello , thanks for your help 
I will study this. 
Just a confirmation, the  schema is the template for a product so my product.xml must match exactly my schema isn't it ?
From my shema (see prev post )  how to create product.xml and add products to grid  ? 
Sorry i'm a newbies , i'm not yet ready with grid
Many thanks
</p>

Hi!

I am also new to Grid so my information might be of a little bit
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 07:56:48 GMT):<br/>
off*

:slight_smile:
</p>
<p><strong>septcinquante</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 07:57:35 GMT):<br/>
have you succes with add a new product ?
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 07:58:05 GMT):<br/>
Yeah. In your schema you define certain things like which properties you want to use. In this case the GDSN 3.1 properties. And within the product.xml you are able to change things a little bit for testing purposes
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 07:58:20 GMT):<br/>
However. The GTIN number is very strict
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 07:58:25 GMT):<br/>
You need to be aware of that
</p>
<p><strong>septcinquante</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 07:58:42 GMT):<br/>
ok , so the schema is not the product template like  i mean ?
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 07:58:46 GMT):<br/>
And I have had some successes with adding products
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 07:58:54 GMT):<br/>
The schema is the template
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 07:59:05 GMT):<br/>
I meant hte product.xml example
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 07:59:24 GMT):<br/>
I am goign in a meeting now.

I will continue talking later ok?
</p>
<p><strong>septcinquante</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 07:59:46 GMT):<br/>
ok thanks i will explore more , stay in touch

How is it going?
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 08:42:28 GMT):<br/>
And copy the product file to the gridd node and create/update the product
</p>
<p><strong>septcinquante</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 13:51:31 GMT):<br/>

Hi!

I got some issues/ questions about Hyperledger grid. I hope someone might answer them for me :)

I have put it in a Word Document to keep it a little bit clean and added screenshots.

<p><strong>satelander</strong> (Thu, 26 Aug 2021 21:06:35 GMT):<br/>
Hey @LeslytH! I've taken a look at your questions so I'll answer them in the order from your document
</p>
<p><strong>satelander</strong> (Thu, 26 Aug 2021 21:06:49 GMT):<br/>
1. You should be able to see a ‚Äúsubmitter‚Äù field on the transaction, which would enable you to search the agent that submitted the transaction. Therefore, you‚Äôd be able to find the organization that made which update.
</p>
<p><strong>satelander</strong> (Thu, 26 Aug 2021 21:06:58 GMT):<br/>
2. If the product you originally made did not have a ‚Äúproperties‚Äù defined, this error might be returned.
</p>
<p><strong>satelander</strong> (Thu, 26 Aug 2021 21:07:07 GMT):<br/>
3. Yes, once again each transaction should have a ‚Äúsubmitter‚Äù or ‚Äúpublic_key" field within the transaction header, which would give you the submitting agent‚Äôs public key. You‚Äôd be able to find the transaction header within logs or within the database. For example, you can also find this value in the ‚Äútransactions‚Äù table in the Grid DB, the ‚Äúsigner_public_key‚Äù column is semantically equivalent to the submitter of the transaction.
</p>
<p><strong>satelander</strong> (Thu, 26 Aug 2021 21:08:02 GMT):<br/>
4. Need to think and ask some questions for this one, will report back.
</p>
<p><strong>satelander</strong> (Thu, 26 Aug 2021 21:08:16 GMT):<br/>
5. You can look at the ‚ÄúUsing Pike‚Äù doc on the Grid website, located here: https://grid.hyperledger.org/docs/0.2/using_pike.html, in the ‚ÄúDelegation of Roles Between Organizations‚Äù section. Pike does support role permissions across organizations. Therefore, as long as you give each agent the correct permissions (with the correct ‚Äúallowed_organizations‚Äù)
</p>
<p><strong>satelander</strong> (Thu, 26 Aug 2021 21:09:26 GMT):<br/>
Let me know if you have any more questions from this
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 26 Aug 2021 21:54:28 GMT):<br/>
```TnT & product catalog properties
How can I implement these properties? If not yet? When Is it possible?

Especially the mention of historical data under header Properties (link)  is very interesting.```

Track and Trace was a sort of example app that predated Grid and was later incorporated into it. It doesnt follow all of the same design principles of modern Grid features like Product, Pike, Location (Not standards based, has a slightly larger scope, not fully built in Rust, etc). Due to that it is currently considered an experimental feature and may not be compatible with the current version of Grid. But it could definitely be updated to work with Grid if someone had a usecase for it. The API and some other functionality is in the grid-contrib repo: https://github.com/hyperledger/grid-contrib/tree/main/track_and_trace
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 26 Aug 2021 22:00:27 GMT):<br/>
I believe the historical data views were implemented via queries against the slowly changing dimensions fields in the database (tracking which data was relevant at a specific commit/block ID). The Grid REST API doesnt currently support that but it could probably be added.

I now have a greater understanding of it all. Also that track and trace contrib POC is very interesting! You should have added a reference to it in the documentation of hyperledger grid so that people get a proper idea of how it works.
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 12:34:56 GMT):<br/>
I am now installing hyperledger grid on Azure in ubuntu 20.04 and will now work to a showable POC/demo for my company where i am doing my assignment for.

Later this day I will probably have some more questions which i anticipate that I get when showing my POC. So I will ask them here in advance so that I am armed with the right knowledge haha!
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Fri, 27 Aug 2021 17:24:07 GMT):<br/>
Okay, first questions haha!

When trying to make multiple Schemas. It was not possible to have multiple schemas active in one circuit right?
So I have to make multiple circuits for multiple schemas? 
It is not possible to delete a circuit when i messed that one up right? 
Also, when i want to connect new nodes besides alpha, gamma and beta. How do I do that? I saw something at the SPlinter documentation. Is that applicable also for hyperledger Grid (splinter)?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/grid?msg=n2TXFdJv8iuBDdNPk) Alright, I'll try to answer a few of these questions.
1. Schemas must have unique names, but you are able to make multiple schemas on a single circuit. You do not need to make multiple circuits for multiple schemas.
2. Yeah, Grid running on Splinter v0.4 does not support circuit deletion. 
3. You can find documentation for how to connect external nodes to a Splinter network on the Splinter site, specifically here: https://splinter.dev/docs/0.4/tutorials/configuring_splinter_nodes.html. If you are running the Splinter example, then the documentation would be useful.
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 06:23:15 GMT):<br/>
OKay thank you for explaining!
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 06:23:44 GMT):<br/>
And what about the: Erro: Field GTIN not found. Even when it is there
</p>
<p><strong>satelander</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 17:05:28 GMT):<br/>
@LeslytH No problem! As for the GTIN field error, I'll have to take a look around a little bit to find a solution there
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 18:14:00 GMT):<br/>
OKay thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 21:12:58 GMT):<br/>
@satelander , Do you already have an idea?
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 21:13:49 GMT):<br/>
Or maybe @dplumb ?
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 21:43:09 GMT):<br/>
Also some questions I am guaranteed that I get when demoing my PoC,

Are there any use cases or examples of companies who are using Hyperledger Grid/Splinter as a demo or PoC? 

Is/will there be any support by a hyperledger team or Splinter team in Europe? So that when I/we need some help or support I/we don't need to wait till night (Our time) before someone is online at your company.

What is the release cycle of Hyperledger grid/Splinter? Every 2 months a new release or something?

Also for which company is the (core) Grid team working for? Splinter is developed by Cargill. But what about Grid?
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Mon, 30 Aug 2021 23:13:05 GMT):<br/>
Also, whenever a new stable version of Splinter is released. How long does it take before the new splinter version is also available/utilised by the grid team?
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Tue, 31 Aug 2021 11:51:11 GMT):<br/>
In this case the `product_id` should be the GTIN instead of that coming from your schema (see the example product for example). That may have caused the issue
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Tue, 31 Aug 2021 11:53:28 GMT):<br/>
There are folks who are using it in a PoC sense but not everyone is publicly contributing yet. You can check the maintainers to see that there are folks from quite a few orgs contributing.
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Tue, 31 Aug 2021 11:53:52 GMT):<br/>
Currently there is no official support team. It is still a very early project. No plans for that at the moment
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Tue, 31 Aug 2021 11:55:07 GMT):<br/>
Splinter releases weekly. Right now Grid releases when we have something to release, but we are trying to get that to be more stable.
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Tue, 31 Aug 2021 11:55:38 GMT):<br/>
Most of the active Grid devs are also at Cargill but there are also significant contributions from Target and a few others
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Tue, 31 Aug 2021 11:57:54 GMT):<br/>
Grid tries to use the stable version of splinter (so not necessarily the weekly release). One of our efforts right now is on compatibility with the dev version of Splinter so we can switch to 0.6 when it comes out.
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Tue, 31 Aug 2021 14:29:14 GMT):<br/>
With that product ID. That is dumb on my part haha
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Tue, 31 Aug 2021 14:29:22 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 08:01:02 GMT):<br/>
Is it maybe an idea to have a troubleshooting page with per category (creating circuits, products, schemas, locations et.) the possible errors? So that people like the developers can keep developing instead of answering questions again and again they probably have see n10 times?
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 08:01:53 GMT):<br/>

Hello @LeslytH  thank for your help. This way is over the standard GS1 shema, but all required fields in GS1 must be fill, right ?
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 09:31:30 GMT):<br/>
If you do not want to use the GS1 properties you leave out the GS properties
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 09:31:33 GMT):<br/>
As in m,y example
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 09:32:17 GMT):<br/>
Do you want to add GS1 properties with additional properties?
</p>
<p><strong>septcinquante</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 09:39:07 GMT):<br/>
It's strange when create a product with no standard shema , i have an error with the GTIN number. I think that the CS1 shema is the base and we need to fill all required fields   or my shema is not taken into consideration. i'm working sawtooth , i understand that you're working on splinter ...

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/grid?msg=3XnwtLtL3WamwyZtG) Hi! Sorry for not getting back sooner, had some other tasks to finish up, but this specific issue is with Docker. I believe this happens when containers get stuck in an odd set-up. I would suggest running `docker system prune -a --volumes` and rebuilding (if attempting with Splinter) using the directions as they are explained here: https://grid.hyperledger.org/docs/0.2/grid_on_splinter.html, including pulling the images to ensure you are using the most up-to-date containers. This will hopefully help with funky docker setups that seem to happen when working with the same containers for awhile.
</p>
<p><strong>satelander</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 14:08:23 GMT):<br/>
New installation @LeslytH, did you remove all containers and rebuild as I suggested above?
</p>

<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 14:19:02 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I am now installing everything again. So I will get bakc to you on it
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 14:20:01 GMT):<br/>
Did you have a look at my other issues? Those are at this point more pressing because I had to postpone my Demo because of the issue..
</p>
<p><strong>satelander</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 14:20:40 GMT):<br/>
Can you clarify which questions you're referring to?
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 14:31:20 GMT):<br/>
I also made a docker compose file for the splinter setup with persistent database volumes. I am not sure if people are interested in having their data persist after shutdown so that they can continue after a while

</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 14:35:57 GMT):<br/>
Some additional information. 

I get the contract error when I try to create a location or schema
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 14:36:18 GMT):<br/>
Creating an agent went okay if I recall correctly
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 14:38:40 GMT):<br/>
I had this issue once when I had 3 circuits, 2 circuits and 1 circuit.

So how that happened I am not sure.

Maybe after docker compose up and down(ing) everything 20 times is killing my HG haha!
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 14:40:30 GMT):<br/>
IDEA: maybe make a docker-compose file available without the UI. They take a long time building and most of the time people (will) use the API I think
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 14:41:12 GMT):<br/>
I know it is easy to do yourself by deleting it out the current docker compose file.

But maybe giving everyone the choice to have it included or excluded might be an idea?
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/grid?msg=qwqiTbtZnZchkoENK) Yeah, a lot of the times running things up/down across a period of time (longer than a day), especially with Docker and its persistent state, can make you run into issues with Docker containers getting wonky.

<p><strong>satelander</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 14:51:01 GMT):<br/>
You may remove the UI from the docker-compose file, or write your own docker-compose file without the UI which should be pretty simple based on our example.

</p>
<p><strong>satelander</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 16:16:48 GMT):<br/>
Ok, you're using the development version of Grid, v0.3. Yes, cloning the repository from the "main" branch will give you that most up-to-date code from our repo
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 16:16:48 GMT):<br/>
How do I downlaod and build 0.2?
</p>
<p><strong>satelander</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 16:19:22 GMT):<br/>
Yes, 0.2 is our stable release (and maybe a better foundation for your PoC, as we are actively developing Grid 0.3) and I believe you can download the crate here: https://crates.io/crates/grid-sdk, otherwise if you are using GitHub, the 0-2 branch in our main repository is Grid v0.2. I believe you could fetch that remote branch (0-2) if you have already cloned the repo.

But if you look here: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-fetch, you should be able to find out how to pull down that remote branch. Probably something like this: `git fetch <remote> <branch>`

<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 16:26:40 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 16:28:55 GMT):<br/>
Just clone the github repository. And that is standard the dev one
</p>
<p><strong>satelander</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 16:29:34 GMT):<br/>
If you look at the "releases" section of the Grid website, you can see all of our stable releases, how to download those, and how to upgrade between stable versions: https://grid.hyperledger.org/releases/0.2/
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 16:32:27 GMT):<br/>
yes i went by that page a few times. However. It does not mention exactly how to get the 0.2 repository on my machine.
Via github that is.
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 16:33:19 GMT):<br/>
I'll try the cargo.toml way
</p>
<p><strong>satelander</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 16:33:21 GMT):<br/>
Yep, I see that the link to the repo doesn't go to the release branches, which it should on the release page. We'll update those release documentation pages
</p>
<p><strong>satelander</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 16:34:16 GMT):<br/>
As the versions exist on Github, is individual branches within the Grid repository. If you want to run Grid 0.2, you need to pull down the 0-2 branch from Grid using the steps I mentioned earlier using git.
</p>
<p><strong>satelander</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 16:34:46 GMT):<br/>
At that point, your local version of Grid, at least on that branch, would be Grid 0.2
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 16:34:53 GMT):<br/>
ok ok
</p>
<p><strong>satelander</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 16:35:54 GMT):<br/>
I would also suggest pulling the images between removing them and rebuilding. Using this line from the walkthrough: `docker-compose -f examples/splinter/docker-compose.yaml pull generate-registry db-alpha scabbard-cli-alpha splinterd-alpha`
</p>
<p><strong>satelander</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 16:36:46 GMT):<br/>
Docker can get into weird states when left running for a long time and without rebuilding in between those long periods of time which may be the cause of some of your issues.
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Thu, 02 Sep 2021 16:46:36 GMT):<br/>

If you want to just use the published images from 0-2, you can use `docker-compose -f examples/splinter/docker-compose-dockerhub.yaml up`

The `dockerhub` compose file utilizes pre-built images that you can find in the Grid 0.2 release page that I linked yesterday, here: https://grid.hyperledger.org/releases/0.2/download.html in the `Docker images` section

It looks like the dockerhub images on 0-2 are pointing to 0-1 images for some reason, we will get that updated. If you use the dockerhub images from main that will get you the right build

first on the 0-2 branch both docker compose and dockerhub one

<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Fri, 03 Sep 2021 16:29:06 GMT):<br/>

IIRC
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Fri, 03 Sep 2021 16:29:21 GMT):<br/>
If you were using main, nothing should have changed to cause that issue with pike

<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Fri, 03 Sep 2021 16:29:34 GMT):<br/>
so it may have been an intermittent issue

ok ok? And what do you mean with that?

<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Fri, 03 Sep 2021 16:32:00 GMT):<br/>
Something like your docker partition running out of space could cause an issue

Yeah, the docker images that are pre-built won't get pulled down. The `--pull` command pulls down the most up-to-date image for that service, so since you are already using pre-built images with the `dockerhub` compose file, it won't affect anything

We do see this error every once in awhile, as it points out that the smart contracts Grid is trying to use have not been correctly loaded which may be due to a Docker issue, network issue, etc., but we do not encounter this error regularly in Grid.
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Tue, 07 Sep 2021 07:05:51 GMT):<br/>

How can I get something similar as Splinter Circuits working on Hyperledger Sawtooth? 

The idea of working with smaller groups within a bigger group really made running Grid on Splinter more preferable. 

But at the moment because I cannot get Grid working on Splinter I am going to try it on Sawtooth

<p><strong>rbuysse</strong> (Tue, 07 Sep 2021 16:36:40 GMT):<br/>
I have some PRs open that should address what's going on here. looks like the compose file is loading the v1 version of the contract. https://github.com/hyperledger/grid/pull/919
</p>
<p><strong>satelander</strong> (Tue, 07 Sep 2021 16:42:53 GMT):<br/>
As for the issue @LeslytH was encountering with Grid on Splinter and the "grid_pike, 2 contract not found" error, we realized the `circuit_management_type` needed to be set to `grid`, as it had been set to something else which wasn't allowing Grid to trigger loading the smart contracts to the created circuit. Going to clarify this point in the documentation for creating a Grid circuit on Splinter.

I thought that the text: "grid" was a placeholdername for the circuits.

Earlier I only made one circuit and just days before my demo I made multiple changes and added circuits and some other things.

But I was pretty sure that management type Grid was okay If I renamed it so I did not bother

@LeslytH (repeating this from a dm sent earlier) Since we were able to use a 3-party circuit to create an organization when we tested this scenario locally, I may need a little more info on what error you're running into, that is coming up in the logs when you attempt to create an organization

@satelander Yes, sorry yet again! 

Have not been very active on here since my showcase of the functionalities to my coworkers.

I have been busy with other things surrounding Hyperledger Grid.
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 07:46:19 GMT):<br/>
I think in a week or two I will retry everything again and return here.
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 09:05:09 GMT):<br/>
But I do have a quick question about Grid/Splinter.

The data is immutable and there can not be tampered with it.

However we can delete products and schemas. But it should still be possible to find out which agent/organization deleted the product/schema right?

In the logs of Splinter it should be seen.

Also, how does HG comply with the GDPR rules in Europe? Especially the right to be forgotten? Could someone explain that to me with an example?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 27 Sep 2021 15:33:03 GMT):<br/>
@LeslytH how does GDPR apply?

What is GDPR?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/grid?msg=Dtfz2kpGG6W2KAZHu) Could someone else from the team answer my questions? 

For clarification:

There is a rule in the GDPR which needs to be adhered to by businesses.

And that is the right to be forgotten. So when an user requests to be deleted from the system. It should be possible to delete that person.

But blockchain solutions like Splinter are immutable and blockchains are known for showing proof of every transaction
</p>
<p><strong>LeslytH</strong> (Fri, 01 Oct 2021 12:40:25 GMT):<br/>
So how does HG comply to the GDPR rule of the right to be forgotten?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 01 Oct 2021 13:27:02 GMT):<br/>
A few things: 1) the ledger we are currently using with splinter is scabbard; scabbard is a digital ledger but not a blockchain and doesn't have the immutability properties you are describing (the Sawtooth backend for Grid does have those properties though, so its still a relevant topic); 2) Grid currently doesn't directly store any personal data; 3) In Pike, Agents have permissions on behalf of organizations; Agents are identified by a public key which could be used by a person, a group of people (more than one person could have the key), or a system process (such as an integration component with another backend system); it is not necessarily possibly to determine who might be using the key without an additional mapping; likely that mapping would be local to the organization and not distributed
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 01 Oct 2021 13:31:16 GMT):<br/>
In Splinter, there is a concept of a "user"; any of the user concepts there are local to an organization and do not intersect with the distributed ledger. For example, there is a feature which allows the REST API to store a key (such as the agent key) on behalf of a user (so if you login to a browser, you can retrieve an encrypted version of the key that you then use when interacting with the ledger). Since the user concept is not distributed, its just stored in the database and is very much a standard web app pattern (no immutability, etc.)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 01 Oct 2021 13:41:00 GMT):<br/>
That said, this is just a description of the pieces of grid that I think might be related to GDPR, but please understand I don't know much about GDPR

Hello, I am a ETH full stack developer and am currently looking into building Enterprise Supply Chain Blockchain software. I have a couple of questions for using Grid.

1. What development tools should be used?

2. How do I write a smart contract? Do I use Sawtooth or Splinter? or Both? What's the difference?

3. Is Grid production ready? When 0.3 releases, will it be backwards compatible?
</p>
<p><strong>david.liu</strong> (Thu, 21 Oct 2021 23:35:09 GMT):<br/>
also, I would like to create an tutorial article explaining how to use Grid for devs coming from ETH

<p><strong>leebradley</strong> (Tue, 26 Oct 2021 14:33:55 GMT):<br/>
@david.liu Hey! So here are some answers to your questions
1. You should be able to use any development tool that is compatible with Rust, but if I had to recommend something, maybe VS Code. Or if you're familiar with VIM, that works quite well!
</p>
<p><strong>leebradley</strong> (Tue, 26 Oct 2021 14:34:14 GMT):<br/>
2. You can write a smart contract in any language that compiles to WASM. To see how to write a smart contract, check out the Sabre guide here: https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/sabre/releases/latest/application_developer_guide.html and the Grid guide for uploading the smart contract https://grid.hyperledger.org/docs/0.2/uploading_smart_contracts.html
</p>
<p><strong>leebradley</strong> (Tue, 26 Oct 2021 14:34:27 GMT):<br/>
Splinter and Sawtooth have different use cases, with Splinter having the ability to manage splinter circuits where data is contained only to that circuit. Sawtooth is much more analogous to Ethereum's global visibility.
</p>
<p><strong>satelander</strong> (Tue, 26 Oct 2021 15:22:01 GMT):<br/>
Ok, I'll answer question 3: We are currently in the process of getting Grid ready for a production environment. When 0.3 releases, it will be backwards compatible with Grid 0.2.

Hi All, quick question: would anyone from the Grid community be willing to help me by filling out a survey[1] for the TSC chat platform task force? I'm happy to do the typing if anyone would prefer to get on a call and just explain themselves instead of filling it out themselves.

[1]: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/TF/Grid
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 14 Dec 2021 15:05:03 GMT):<br/>
@peter_somogyvari I updated the survey with answers; these answers would generally apply to Sawtooth and Transact as well with the exception that those projects do not interact with non-engineer users as often.
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Tue, 14 Dec 2021 15:23:27 GMT):<br/>
@amundson Understood, thank you very much for taking the time to fill it out!

Hi everyone,

SInce the attack of log4j a lot of things are banned at my qorganization until further notice.

How did the log4j impact the docker images of Hyperledger (Grid)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 30 Dec 2021 17:03:07 GMT):<br/>
@LeslytH Grid doesn't use java, thus no log4j.

Greetings TeamGrid! We are evaluating Grid + Sawtooth, and are having issues with a "docker-compose build" in the grid repo. The build never seems to finish. "cargo build" natively on a new Apple M1 Mac works fine. We're interested in pushing this out to a test k8s environment. Anyone experience something similar?
</p>
<p><strong>cxk934</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 14:49:54 GMT):<br/>
Took me a bit (and an Intel mac) to realize the obvious. This just won't work on an M1 because of the Sawtooth dependency on Intel chipsets.
