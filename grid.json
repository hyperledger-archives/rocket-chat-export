{"msg":"A use case: One of the constraints I'm attempting to address is that new Docker images would be generated (in some fashion) as part of a new version of an artifact on chain, specifically smart contracts. I'm not yet comfortable with the idea of using Docker images in a Kubernetes environment where auto-scale (at an app level) or k8s cluster events (node rolling) would mean relying on mutating a defined Docker image defined as a replica in a deployment. That mutation coming from on-chain applications. My preference would be to say that the on-chain change of a new version of the smart contract generates a new Docker image (tested via a pipeline) and updated into a manifest (Helm, vanilla YAML, whatever), and then through a CI/CD pipeline \"approved\" to get deployed. I realize there are some other gates in those steps but I've seen some automated deployments in a controlled pipeline k8s implementation get into a roll back loop and not be able to run any pods because everything is sideways.","username":"desktophero","ts":"2019-06-13T04:52:35.931Z"}

I'm not clear on the RBAC enforcement model within Grid - either the conceptual thinking around the direction it will go or if there are concrete examples. From an \"enterprise\" view, these roles would typically be delegated by a separate role that doesn't have permissions to modify schema but does have permissions to apply/remove/enforce those permissions to other roles as well as add agents (people, systems, etc.) to the roles.

{"msg":"@Levilk there is not a timeline for Fabric support. many of us are using Sawtooth with PBFT because it is a better fit for our use cases. but from a Grid project perspective, we do want wider DLT support. so, we do have an informal medium/long term plan. the general approach will be to integrate support for Transact (which can run Grid's Sabre contracts) into Fabric. that is a deep platform engineering task (really, between Fabric and Transact). once that is done, then it should be relatively easy to figure out the tasks we need to do as part of Grid. In the short term, as a Grid community we are committed to only include smart contracts that can be run in Transact so we are in-line with this plan.","username":"amundson","ts":"2019-09-20T14:40:28.345Z"}

The user guide covers the complete experience in the tool, but there is a location data model starting on page 21 - which includes all attributes supported in the tool. As @Gena had previously shared, the EPCIS event visibility data sharing standard also has location (site and sub-site) master data attributes, which are detailed in the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) standard. Both of those were already uploaded to the Wiki by Gena some months ago. We have a new team member that just started two weeks ago, he is going to begin working on pulling together the GS1 Location overview for the RFC immediately.

{"msg":"@shadab14meb346 1) Grid supports both Sawtooth and Splinter (https://www.splinter.dev/), both of which are committed to running smart contracts with Hyperledger Transact, which is how we run WASM contracts in Sabre. These platforms are distributed, which make them suitable for the types of patterns we need in supply chain. Where they are deficient, we are actively changing them to be more suitable for Grid. 2) Architecture primarily. I don't want to get into all Fabric's disadvantages here, but lack of support for Transact and its centralized architecture; 3) Not NodeJS specifically, but Javascript smart contracts are definitely something we are interested in adding (thus why we explored AssemblyScript), either within Sabre or as another smart contract engine that runs in Transact. We will keep with on-chain smart contracts, because any other model has administration issues. 4) From a platform perspective, we are using Rust because its the perfect programming language for what we are doing. Besides the language being great, the ecosystem and libraries are excellent. Platforms written in Go are kind of legacy, like COBOL. And Node is Javascript, which is maybe the worst of everything for systems programming problems. However, if you mean for smart contracts specifically -- we are really focused on WASM, not Rust. Rust has the best support for compiling into WASM with relatively small resulting binaries. Adding Go smart contract SDK to Sabre is certainly possible, but the resulting WASM binaries would be relatively large due to Go's runtime. Javascript is actually very interesting for smart contracts though (as long as it is on-chain).","username":"amundson","ts":"2020-07-01T15:04:00.567Z"}

Given the broader use and standards already existing about them, I think it makes sense.

After reading James' response in the thread, it seemed to indicate linking a GS1 prefix to pike orgs with a transaction signed by the appropriate GS1 identity for this purpose, but maybe that serves a different purpose.  My original question was this:  Is the intent to validate the GLN input with GS1? Wondering if there is a need to validate the input is coming from the correct GS1 company prefix and those who are associated with it, from a GS1 perspective. I think stated differently, is how do we ensure bad actors are ruled out and not allowed to input false or misleading data if they simply use a valid GS1 company prefix and the check digit format is correct as part of the GLN?","username":"mattp","ts":"2020-08-13T20:21:19.816Z"}

{"msg":"A few things: 1) the ledger we are currently using with splinter is scabbard; scabbard is a digital ledger but not a blockchain and doesn't have the immutability properties you are describing (the Sawtooth backend for Grid does have those properties though, so its still a relevant topic); 2) Grid currently doesn't directly store any personal data; 3) In Pike, Agents have permissions on behalf of organizations; Agents are identified by a public key which could be used by a person, a group of people (more than one person could have the key), or a system process (such as an integration component with another backend system); it is not necessarily possibly to determine who might be using the key without an additional mapping; likely that mapping would be local to the organization and not distributed","username":"amundson","ts":"2021-10-01T13:27:02.567Z"}
{"msg":"In Splinter, there is a concept of a \"user\"; any of the user concepts there are local to an organization and do not intersect with the distributed ledger. For example, there is a feature which allows the REST API to store a key (such as the agent key) on behalf of a user (so if you login to a browser, you can retrieve an encrypted version of the key that you then use when interacting with the ledger). Since the user concept is not distributed, its just stored in the database and is very much a standard web app pattern (no immutability, etc.)","username":"amundson","ts":"2021-10-01T13:31:16.378Z"}
