I'm viewing this in my browser - does anyone know if I can view it from an app or slack itself?
</p>
<p><strong>richbl</strong> (Thu, 28 Sep 2017 22:34:37 GMT):<br/>
@BenG 11, the application that's running here is called Rocket.Chat, and works similar to, but is different from Slack. So there's no native way to get a Rocket.Chat channel integrated into (or redirected to) a Slack channel. That said, there's some work done here that suggests that its indeed possible: https://sameroom.io/integrations/connect-slack-and-rocketchat

Separately, if you'd like to view Rocket.Chat on other platforms, there are several options to choose from, noted here: https://rocket.chat/download

I'm finally here! Hi all
</p>
<p><strong>mpiekarska</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 13:12:43 GMT):<br/>
To spin off some discussion pasting the @dbulleit answers to the comments from last call about FHIRBlocks
</p>
<p><strong>mpiekarska</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 13:12:45 GMT):<br/>
1) What is the FHIRBlocks team's background?
The FHIRBlocks Project team is descendent from DCS Health, developer of HoIP, (a leading CDHP platform). I was previously BellSouth’s Chief Strategist, and most to the FHIRBlocks team are network engineers with extensive internet/carrier development backgrounds

2) What is FHIRBlocks’ security/access model?
FHIRblocks centerpiece (and principle contribution to HyperLedger) is contained in its Supplemental Method of Open Access Control (SMOAC).  And SMOAC itself is best views as an overlay upon OAUTH2/OIDC that effects a higher level of trust; high enough, in fact, to enable open access to FHIR networks by users and applications not registered to traditional EHR/enterprise networks (see also #3 below)

3) How does FHIRBlocks map patient identifiers to specific FHIR Resources?
Another key FHIRBlocks component is the notion of a CSI (certified self-sovereign identity). CSI’s (which we believe can comprise and extension of Indy) also serves as a virtual UPI (i.e., via DNS-like translations to FHIR server registries and MPIs); CSI’s also comprise the rough equivalent of a client-side digital certificate

4) How does FHIRBlocks achieve more attractive “cryptoeconomics?
Perhaps the mist import aspect of SMOAC, CSI and other FHIRBlocks components is it potential to animate new business models—e.g., by enabling application providers building of monetization schemes independent of EHRs

5) What is FHIRBlocks' governance model?  Who participates in the concensus model?
TBD. In fact, we’re hoping to get input from this working group on key questions of this sort—e.g., what alternatives does Fabric support?
</p>
<p><strong>dbulleit</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 13:12:59 GMT):<br/>
Quick question: Is this board intended to augment or replace the WG listserv?
</p>
<p><strong>mpiekarska</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 13:13:09 GMT):<br/>
What d'yall think?

<p><strong>dbulleit</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 13:14:07 GMT):<br/>
Thanks Marta (I suppose that I never quite mastered the listserv protocol;-)

<p><strong>mpiekarska</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 13:14:31 GMT):<br/>
Augment. This is the prompt discussion forum that expands mailing list which should be used for longer and more asynchronous communication

<p><strong>censonhealth</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 13:19:40 GMT):<br/>

I prefer the email for several reasons, including persistence in my workflow and limiting the number of messaging platforms that I have to maintain low latency.  I like the proposal to keep email as the primary record and chat as where sausage making occurs.  I can hop here occasionally, but cannot commit to staying current in rocket chat.

<p><strong>richbl</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 14:53:00 GMT):<br/>
Good Morning All... since I asked for the channel, it should be clear my preference: use this to replace the listserv. As @Eelke noted, you can configure RC to send you email notifications (which, BTW, is invaluable ot me). 

I'll add that the singular value of the listserv might be for broadcast (read-only) announcements only. This could conceivably reach a larger audience because of the comments noted here: email is in everyone's workflow.

Hi All I am a doctor working in Argentina I guess Hyperledger can help Public Hospitals and Health Ministries  in speeding up the authorization process digitally and safely Is there any working/live project around? Id like to see this as a help for cost reduction and hospitalization Oh! I grew up in Texas Feels good to get to know all of youu

<p><strong>richbl</strong> (Fri, 29 Sep 2017 21:31:05 GMT):<br/>
@DomingoLiotta, hola Domingo. Great idea for introductions (apologies if it's already been done in some other context). 

I own a systems and software engineering company in Seattle. Our past history has included government clients associated with the DoD (Army and Navy, and other non-military entities), though with the passage of the ACA, we continue to gain customers in the healthcare space with interests in digital health and data and visual analytics.

I also happen to be a long-term (since I was 15) patient of chronic kidney disease (a genetic disease called PKD), survived renal failure through home hemo-dialysis, and received a kidney transplant in late 2013. As a result of my chronic disease, I've been active most of my life in the kidney care community. Currently I'm active as a board member (also past chair) of the 3rd largest non-profit kidney care organization in the US called Northwest Kidney Centers (NKC), which is based right here in Seattle.

As a result, you might imagine that the engineering work we do in healthcare is very personal (what better way to operate a business?) and admittedly self-serving (HA!).

@richbl Hola Rich :) I am actively reading the fine opinions of this Forum For developing countries its an extra effort to develop a working project but tapping into digital expertise from all of you I am sure to be able to help my public hospital I work as a professor in a large University if this can help to make a more formal bond with any Institution or Company

<p><strong>richbl</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 20:45:49 GMT):<br/>
@Hatch 4, welcome to the channel. Speaking for myself, we're not looking at big pharma quite yet. Still spending time understanding workflows as they relate to patient-managed datasets and interoperability (big big issue). As you may have read in my intro, my interest tends towards patient management in the chronic disease space. Of course, you can imagine that pharma plays essentially in that space. :)

I have to apologize for rescheduling the virtual meet-up twice, now, but due to scheduling snafus (people didn't get calendar invites for today) we decided to hold the October virtual meet-up next Tuesday at 3pm EST / 12pm PDT.

I just sent a brand new one right for next Tuesday, 10/31. I will follow up with an agenda and Webex details when we confirm a team to showcase.

Please respond to this survey so we can get a sense of this group: https://goo.gl/forms/gS2eoLkUrizLr5nf1

Also, please recommend companies, projects, or experts for us to showcase / hear from during these calls. You can nominate yourself too! https://goo.gl/forms/bT7nmwePV5eIi7mh2

Please note the conversation happening on the mailing list. We will be scheduling next call in January with new hosts, if the community doesn't object to the suggested candidates. 
</p>
<p><strong>richbl</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 22:06:42 GMT):<br/>
@mpiekarska, thanks. It'd be great if that information were posted here as well (I really hate having to parse those long mailing list threads).
</p>
<p><strong>mpiekarska</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 22:06:56 GMT):<br/>

Dear all,
We would like to ask you to review the proposal for following chairs of the Working Group:

- Robert Cho, Embleema
- Kyle Culver, Humana
- Nathan DeNiro, YouBase

Please let us know if you object to this leadership group EOB, 21st of December. The gentlemen had an initial meeting and will be happy to share notes on what direction they envision. 

Happy holidays
m
</p>
<p><strong>mpiekarska</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 22:07:34 GMT):<br/>
Kyle has been co-hosting the meetings with Emily since the group started. Emily recently stepped down and we were looking for a strong team of diverse leaders who can ensure that the group is not pushed in any direction and works in an open manner. Robert from Embleema has very thorough healthcare background and is enthusiastic about Hyperledger community. Embleema has been working with Hyperledger for a while. Finally, Nathan has been one of the most active people on this mailing list. He has long been known in the open source community, and understands healthcare and blockchain.
</p>
<p><strong>mpiekarska</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 22:07:52 GMT):<br/>
We wanted to make sure that the hosts are in time for the next meeting. You may have noticed that the December meeting has not happened - mainly due to holidays but also lack of leadership. The duties and responsibilities of a chair are to arrange virtual and F2F meetings and lead the discussion. Hosts do not have a stronger voice, and people proposed fully understand and are aligned on the openness of the group and needing to do everything in public. 
</p>
<p><strong>richbl</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 22:14:09 GMT):<br/>
@mpiekarska, Awesome! Thanks and have a great Holiday!

Hi all. Just joined the group. I'm an enterprise architect working in medical devices / life sciences. Interested in how blockchain vendors (or EHR vendors offering blockchain solutions) will act differently when it comes to interoperability of multiple private distributed ledgers across healthcare providers, compared to the current legacy data silos. What new behaviors, consortia and standards need to be brought in  - or is HL7/FHIR enough? 
</p>
<p><strong>jonreid</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:01:06 GMT):<br/>
@Hatch 4 reading your 'interests' post, you might be interested in this initiative, including IEEE standards : https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-day-big-pharma-seeks-dlt-solution-drug-costs/ and also https://www.mediledger.com/ .
</p>
<p><strong>richbl</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:26:21 GMT):<br/>
@jonreid, welcome to this channel! From what part of the country (or outside the country) do you hail? Interesting concept that you call out: that--going forward--if blockchains/DLTs are indeed adopted, that we might end up with interoperability issues between blockchains/DLTs. Sort of a meta issue, where we end up successfully adding yet another level of indirection to baseline datasets. Apologies if I've read too much into your theme. Again, welcome!
</p>
<p><strong>nugget</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 18:40:38 GMT):<br/>
I would really hope we could move away from HL7 long term but i have a feeling it will bleed into Healthcare blockchains in the early days.

@richbl I'm always inside a country - trustless isn't yet a national identity option... ;-) I'm based in the UK (so you'll see strange spellings like behaviour, customisation and through ... ) but have worked in global teams with US predominance for about a decade. You summarised my meta concerns correctly. I think in addition we need to take a more customer-centric view. To take a generic  example: What hospital really wants to run a different proprietary blockchain for every vendor they buy connected, EHR data generating devices from? I'm surmising none. So this means lots of vendors cooperating around a shared set of trustless nodes that competing care providers create, connect onto etc. This level of cooperation has never really happened before without top-down imposition - like with the UK's NHS information governance standards for third party service providers.So top down standards, distributed governance & bottom up implementation is what I'm thinking may work best. Just my two cents. Interested in what others in the WG think.

<p><strong>richbl</strong> (Sat, 13 Jan 2018 15:39:35 GMT):<br/>
@jonreid, Indeed! However, I'll mention that you're imagining blockchain/DLT solutions as full replacements for existing EHR backends, and while I believe that's possible, there's quite a bit of room for new or supplemental DLT services that work in conjunction with existing EHRs and proprietary IT stacks (architectures). Hoping the colloquialism carries, but we don't want to be throwing the baby out with the bathwater just yet :). I should add that we're based out of Seattle, USA, so the brass ring of a single-payer healthcare system is far out of reach at this moment in time: I believe this to be a cultural/generational issue (hoping that a younger generation sees the need to change our perceptions at  a deeper, social level).

All told, here in the present, easily the biggest issue we regularly face is not technical at all, but political: finding the right context (and funding) to demonstrate these great new services.

</p>
<p><strong>richbl</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 22:14:22 GMT):<br/>
@NateDiNiro, interesting read. Thanks for posting. 

To be honest, I see much of the blockchain hype (heavy emphasis on hype) as a misunderstanding of the technology: it's seen as a panacea for just about any problem in healthcare today! Heady promises abound in a world where healthcare IT tends to move very slowly. That said, I prefer to focus on the underlying technologies that are getting more attention because of the blockchain hype, including distributed ledger technologies proper (not necessarily blockchains in the context of current Hyperledger projects), and distributed identity management (aka, self-sovereign identity management). The latter is of particular interest to me, as it lays up nicely in understanding how patient- and clinical-facing services should be properly architected in healthcare going forward.

That said, in line with what was identified in the article, I'm also familiar with FHIR, and for the sake of interoperability in today's stove-piped EHR environment, it's much easier (and generally lower cost) to implement than HL7 proper. From a developer's perspective, FHIR as a technology is certainly much more elegant. Of course, interoperability requires vendors to open up, which--in an unregulated space--is very hard to do (I worked at Microsoft many years ago when MS-DOS and then Windows APIs were notoriously not so well documented for a reason).

@channel,

In line with Nate's interesting article, I wanted to share a good (though long) article from the New Yorker on technological advances in the small Eastern European country of Estonia. The breadth of the article covers all things digital, but you can very quickly see how the application of "doing the right thing" can be applied here in the US (given some cultural changes and/or acceptance of some level of government or institutional management). 

*"Estonia, the Digital Republic"*: https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/12/18/estonia-the-digital-republic

In short, if you want to read something upbeat and reinforcing of why we're all here doing what we're doing (and often butting heads and spinning wheels), this is really a great read.

@MartinKrmer : I am assuming given your word usage, that you are talking about Hyperledger Fabric. I would be concerned that most patients would not be able to run the servers and software necessary for peer nodes. In addition, since Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned network, you would need to figure out how to get the right permissions to the patients through Hyperledger Fabric CA

Hi team, I believe I am new to the chat here.  I have been working both at Optum and a number of blockchain startups (some healthcare related).  I have read some of the above and love the thinking.  I have formed a slightly different opinion on how blockchain works in more privacy-required spaces, like healthcare.  Of course, the tech is changing and so by the time I finish this it could be outdated. :-)

The first thing to note is why blockchain is valuable - it really does two things.  Reduces the cost of verification (math to establish trust) and reduces the cost of networking (infrastructure, building network effects, "the economics").  The first is really easy for people to grasp once they dive into the tech and many teams stop there - the thinking is walled around this concept of sharing data, single source-of-truth through consensus, etc.  This is the pitfall that the healthcare industry ran into when constructing the concept of the HIE - there was little consideration for the economics of the network (data socialism) - and we all know what happened/is happening there.

The blockchain solutions that really show promise look carefully at how public networks are successful and do not shy away from tokenization.  The token is a protocol in your network that is a tool to incentivize (or punish) participation and enable a data marketplace.  Imagine trying to create a country without a currency - goods and services would need to be bartered between participants, it's a step backward in time and limits innovation.

Layer trust and privacy --> The layering of innovative, permissionless blockchains over more permissioned data storage models (of which I classify any permissioned blockchain, IPFS, SQL database running in your basement, etc.) is the key to success here in healthcare.  It could be... "Fork of ethereum run as a public network" + Hyperledger (for healthcare consortium) + SQL databases hosting in secure data centers (for more private/sensitive/IP-related data) = enabling a use case.

If anyone wants to talk more about this please reach out.  Thanks! (Tony_Little@Optum360.com)

Hey Everyone, We are conducting a poll specifically to determine when we should try to schedule periodic meetings. Considering HLHCWG has a global membership we are trying to get a sense of what works for everyone. I selected the first Friday in March AT RANDOM: NO ACTUAL MEETING. ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES. 

We are trying to get a poll of what times might work for a weekly or bi-weekly call for the HCWG. So just pick times of the day that might work on a Friday. Please verify that the poll you see is displaying your local time zone. After examining all the data, we will have more concrete options.

@TonyLittle 

Welcome to the group. Thanks for providing an intro, and thanks particularly for your insight into some of the issues and benefits of blockchain solutions. While my own background is technical (software and systems engineering), I always stop short of any intriguing technical solution and ask the question: what about the politics? That is, what is it about a great solution that prevents its implementation? Does it solve the wrong problem(s)? Does it too quickly move the power in established bureaucracies to an undesireable place? Has the solution just been poorly or incorrectly explained?

I often work with a colleague who's the CIO of a large dialysis care organization (3rd largest non-profit in the US), and he always enjoys my creative technical solutions, and after hearing my pitches asks the same question "but what about the politics of that organization?" Meaning: a solution isn't a real solution until it's fully understood and fully accepted. Only then does the underlying technology begin to matter.

Again, thanks, and hope to continue these discussions.

Thanks Rich!  

I agree with our take on the politics; it is something that we all navigate as we get older and wiser on why some projects live and others die.  One my mentors early in my "BizTech" career (which was an unexpected path for me, starting out as a physician) said something like, "It takes at least two people working together to make anything happen in this world - one with passion and one with money."  One of the ideas that follows this quote is that a disconnect between ideas and risk analysis is key to success; and the right balance is (a necessary) key.

I really enjoyed the article you posted.  Here are a few thoughts and then quotes from the article that seemed to frame them. I have to break my thoughts up as it appears the post was too long...

One my mentors early in my "BizTech" career (which was an unexpected path for me, starting out as a physician) said something like, "It takes at least two people working together to make anything happen in this world - one with passion and one with money."  One of the ideas that follows this quote is that a disconnect between ideas and risk analysis is key to success; and the right balance is (a necessary) ingredient.

I really enjoyed the article you posted.  Here are a few of my thoughts while reading, and then "quotes" from the article that inspired them.

2) Key to the success of any human-data platform is transparency with consent for consensus-determined private data
“In Estonia, we don’t have Big Brother; we have Little Brother,” a local told me. “You can tell him what to do and maybe also beat him up.”

3) It is key in any relationship to create a system that reduces the opportunity for moral hazard
"The openness is startling. Finding the business interests of the rich and powerful—a hefty field of journalism in the United States—takes a moment’s research, because every business connection or investment captured in any record in Estonia becomes searchable public information."

5) A borderless economy is critical - I am working on a startup that is likely going to crush in the "reduction of economic censorship" space.
"And heat is taken off immigration because, in a borderless society, a resident need not even have visited Estonia in order to work and pay taxes under its dominion. The program that resulted is called e-residency, and it permits citizens of another country to become residents of Estonia without ever visiting the place. An e-resident has no leg up at the customs desk, but the program allows individuals to tap into Estonia’s digital services from afar. “There are so many companies in the world for whom working across borders is a big hassle and a source of expense”"

6) "Positive feedback loops" are so cool in this tech - everyone that contributes, wins, and very little is taken as part of a "fee" for transactions.  This makes thinking about "working for the government" more about "working for the people" instead of contributing to the "system/problem"
"“Countries are like enterprises,” he said. “They want to increase the wealth of their own people.” “If someone had asked me, three years ago, if I could imagine myself working for the government, I would have said, ‘Fuck no,’"
</p>
<p><strong>TonyLittle</strong> (Thu, 08 Feb 2018 08:23:28 GMT):<br/>
7) Solving the "startup problem" for these networks is a challenge.  "If you build it, they will come" has been tried and failed because the wrong use cases were considered.  Below is a great example of "how to start".
"Finland started two years earlier with an I.D. card, but it’s still a sad story,” he said. “Nobody uses it, because they put a hefty price tag on the card, and it’s a voluntary document. We sold it for ten euros at first, and what happened? Banks and application providers would say, ‘Why should I support this card? Nobody has it.’ It was a dead end.” In what may have been the seminal insight of twenty-first-century Estonia, Martens realized that whoever offered the most ubiquitous and secure platform would run the country’s digital future—and that it should be an elected leadership, not profit-seeking Big Tech. “The only thing was to push this card to the people, without them knowing what to do with it, and then say, ‘Now people have a card. Let’s start some applications,’ ” he said.

The first “killer application” for the I.D.-card-based system was the one that Martens still works on: i-voting, or casting a secure ballot from your computer. Before the first i-voting period, in 2005, only five thousand people had used their card for anything. More than nine thousand cast an i-vote in that election, however—only two per cent of voters, but proof that online voting was attracting users—and the numbers rose from there. As of 2014, a third of all votes have been cast online."

8) Great blockchain description/analogy that I had not heard before.  I wonder how mining/auditing nodes works there?  Open participation and rewards to secure it or only controlled via permissioned participants?  Probably the latter.
"Beyond X-Road, the backbone of Estonia’s digital security is a blockchain technology called K.S.I. A blockchain is like the digital version of a scarf knitted by your grandmother. She uses one ball of yarn, and the result is continuous. Each stitch depends on the one just before it. It’s impossible to remove part of the fabric, or to substitute a swatch, without leaving some trace: a few telling knots, or a change in the knit."

9) Being honest about data privacy is key here - it's not as big a social change as many of us "older" folks think today - with the advent of social media, people are more likely to share if it offers convenience and value.
"Popular anxiety tends to focus on data security—who can see my information?—but bits of personal information are rarely truly compromising. The larger threat is data integrity: whether what looks secure has been changed. (It doesn’t really matter who knows what your blood type is, but if someone switches it in a confidential record your next trip to the emergency room could be lethal.)"

and

"I asked Kaevats what he saw when he looked at the U.S. Two things, he said. First, a technical mess. Data architecture was too centralized. Citizens didn’t control their own data; it was sold, instead, by brokers. Basic security was lax. “For example, I can tell you my I.D. number—I don’t fucking care,” he said. “You have a Social Security number, which is, like, a big secret.” He laughed. “This does not work!” The U.S. had backward notions of protection, he said, and the result was a bigger problem: a systemic loss of community and trust."

@TonyLittle

Great feedback. I tend to use this Estonia article as a touchstone when I wonder why I'm tilting windmills as often as I do... because it all _can_ work if done right.

Regarding your comment about data privacy, I agree absolutely that social media is resetting perceptions about sharing. But... my observation is that younger folks (I'm 52) will drive much of the change in healthcare precisely because of the expectations that they've grown up with as it relates to social media: transparency, timeliness, and perhaps most important, engagement (specifically, incentive for long-term, regular engagement... often served through a very active, reinforcing feedback loop).

And I also enjoyed reading about how Estonia handed out ID cards to everyone, and THEN approached vendors and said "look, you have an audience... go build something and engage them." My colleagues and I hope to implement something like this out here in Seattle. Of course, funding is still evasive, but we're convinced that persistence will win out :).

That said, I'm right now in the process of trying to kickstart the existing Seattle chapter of the [HyperLedger Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Hyperledger-Seattle-Chapter/), which has languished. Unfortunately, I haven't heard back from the organizer in just over a week (go figure). Let's hope that Hyperledger folks proper get this moving again.

@MartinKrmer Hi!  "Only a student" describes all of us here when it comes to blockchain.  :-) 
"Fork of ethereum run as a public network" is a nod to the process of creating a new public blockchain by taking an existing one, rename it, tweak to protocols a bit to meet the use cases you hope your participants will want to implement on it, and let it loose.  In this context, you would let the token (with a new name) trade publically so you have good network bootstrapping effects.  It would be your permissionless layer.

</p>

Hey everyone, I just posted this message to the email dist list, but wanted to post it here as well. For those of you attending HIMSS next week in vegas, please consider meeting up with the WG members Monday 6-7pm. More details here : https://lists.hyperledger.org/pipermail/healthcare-wg/2018-March/000280.html Looking forward to seeing everyone!

@Daniela_Barbosa, thanks for posting in this channel (oddly, I haven't yet received the email via listserve). I hope to be there (though I'll technically be manning one of the booths at that time).

@TonyLittle Let's do it! I'm with Centene/Health Net. Claims adjudication relies on 1) field edits, 2) member eligibility, 3) provider eligibility, 4) prior authorizations, 5) benefits, and 6) pricing. Can these functionalities be built into a blockchain smart contracts? What are some of the challenges to deploying a solution? And what would it take to build and stand one up? These are some of the things I'm trying to learn more about.

<p><strong>richbl</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 16:58:10 GMT):<br/>
@Daniela_Barbosa, good morning. Yes, messages just showed up this morning. Not sure of why the delay (I'd guess a listserve caching issue). 

I'd be curious of anyone else suffers this kind of delay. My email client is Google Inbox (SMTP). I suspect most folks run a Windows box with Outlook (or similar)

Welcome to the workgroup! Glad to have you here. I just read your Linkedin article, and it's good to see that you have some development experience with Hyperledger. Also, great use case that you've documented (we might find some value by getting it included more with the [Hyperledger use cases listed here](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/requirements/use-case-inventory)).

When you have some time, please tell us a bit about your background, and professional interests (I'll guess you have an engineering/development background). 

Again, welcome!

@azeeshan well written piece and it aligns with what we at Camelotis are thinking of. We are builiding a similar approach to yours, although the use cases vary. One thing I have constantly been debating about is the load that these architectures put on the network. I think computing is a lesser problem as compared to network. Want to know what are your broad ideas on handling the network load. If it is not possible to explain your idea, without revealing your IP, then I will wait to see a production implementation. That said, do you have a production demo I can look at ?

Regarding the potential benefits of Hyperledger versus Ethereum, two big differences are scalability and confidentiality.  Because Ethereum is open to all kinds of different transactions, it will be weighed down by transactions supporting hundreds of applications.  Creating a private blockchain with Hyperledger limits activity only to transactions relevant to the application.  Regarding confidentiality, confidentiality on blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin is passive and de facto.  Identities of transacting parties are undecipherable because various transactions mostly look alike.  In Enterprise blockchains, many unique transactions can occur that allow detection of the identify of transaction parties through inference.  For example, if see three large transactions every month for a product like Viagra, we can infer that the seller is Pfizer and that the buyers are the Big 3 distributors through whom 90% of all prescription drugs pass in the US.  Further analysis could allow us to distinguish between the three and also determine the identity of some of their larger customers.  A private Hyperledger solution may build in additional layers of obfuscation to prevent this valuable competitive intelligence from being guessed.

Regarding the utility of a token, I believe that many blockchain applications will ultimate be served by using a token for access and/or payment.  While Hyperledger intentionally does not foster a "native" cryptocurrency token, we believe that such tokens will arise in the market.  In fact, we are developing one ourselves that specifically targets Hypeledger blockchains.  Recognizing that there will be many Hyperledger blockchains with different structures and rules, it is important to first develop chain code that will allow these blockchains to perform payment transactions on our cryptocurrency blockchain, while the other aspects of the transaction remain native to each private blockchain solution.  If you are interested in working with us, please contact me at stollman.j@gmail.com.

@jstollman,
Welcome to the workgroup! Glad to have you join us. Please tell us a bit about your interests in blockchain technologies, Hyperledger in particular, and your professional background.

Very good read on identifying some differences between Ethereum and Hyperledger. I agree that there will be many blockchain solutions running in parallel, and many more with very specific requirements and use cases that will define their architectures. I particularly found your interpretation of transaction analytics of blockchains interesting, though that would assume that transactions are always made in an open channel (not necessarily true when using the Fabric framework). 

And I agree absolutely that tokens will become a fundamental component of most blockchain solutions, as they can be utilized in such a way to drive incentive, which will help drive acceptance. Perhaps your token solution can be the first Hyperledger project that implements a framework agnostic token solution. That would be great!

Again, welcome!

@semanticmd ,
Welcome to the workgroup. Glad to have you join us. Please tell us a bit about your interests in blockchain technologies, Hyperledger in particular, and your professional background.

As for your question, please describe in a bit more detail how you're defining medical data storage. I'm not quite sure what you're hoping to do (storing data directly in a blockchain can be a design consideration that might be difficult to adhere to... often pointers to data is a better design decision). What's your specific use case?

Hi,
I wonder if someone here can help me... I am glad for any answer. :-) 
Background: I'm doing a small design science study with hyperledger blockchain regarding patient health records.
Since you all have some domain knowledge, how would evaluate the resulting "artefact"?
What theory(ies) would use for a healthcare IT blockchain artefacts?
Do you think there are enough people here around for performing a few interviews (4-6)?

Thanks in advance!

Hello Marino, and welcome to the workgroup. Glad to have you join us. Please tell us a bit about your interests in blockchain technologies, Hyperledger in particular, and your professional background.

To answer your question about EHRs... that's a big domain. What specifically are you interested in accomplishing? My company here in Seattle (Digitalhealthcare.io) is working with some area hospital systems, and in the process of defining an architecture for a patient-managed (self-sovereign ) solution. Interoperability is going to be a significant issue, as our goal is to ultimately abstract away the work of interacting through individual hospital systems. However, as you might already know, every EHR is different, as is every implementation of an EHR in a hospital system. It's an interesting problem.

To get to your answer more directly, our current design is using Hyperledger Fabric.

Again, welcome to the work group!

Hey, folks. Sorry for cutting off the call earlier this morning. Unfortunately, the meeting that followed was waiting to join their call. Please be aware that the Healthcare WG call is scheduled for 1 hour. Running over impacts the next meeting. Also, I notice that people are dialing into the call more than a 1/2 hour before it is scheduled to start. This impacts the recording, which starts as soon as someone joins.

^^ Finished the edx course a couple weeks ago.  Very worthwhile.  It does require some technical foundation to get through the hands on Sawtooth and Fabric installs.  The #training-and-education-wg seems to be very active in updating the content so I would look forward to more advanced training opportunities in the future

Good Day, I am Ryno from South Africa. I currently hold a BTech in IT Software Engineering. I have been researching blockchain technologies for a few months now for my Masters project this year.  Hyperledger Fabric seems to be the best way to go. I have done most of the tutorials for Hyperledger Fabric and I have to say the learning curve is quite something. It is simple concept but implementation is complex. I managed to spin up a Hyperledger Fabric network from scratch and clustering with Docker Swarm. I am still not expert with Channels and Deploying chaincode. I understand these things but its different when you actually create your new things. Sorry for the long Intro. I was wondering what you guys think of using Hyperledger Fabric for storing personal health records? I have seen people do it on Ethereum POA but the scalability and privacy does not seem to be all that great.

@Switch2Logic

Welcome to the workgroup, and glad to have you join us. The Hyperledger frameworks are indeed a bit complicated to get into, but there are quite a number of samples out there. For me, the best way to learn is to study these working models and iterate from there.

As for your specific question, we're developing a healthcare solution using Fabric, and our design does not store health records directly on the ledger. Instead, we're using IPFS (https://ipfs.io/) to hash links to off-chain data, which may include health records, among other related datasets.

Interestingly, this approach is similar, in some respects, to another healthcare company called Coral Health (https://mycoralhealth.com/). Their company CEO, Andy Park, recently presented here in Seattle, and confirmed their use of IPFS in their solution design.

@richbl 

Thank you for the warm welcome. I am very pleased with this answer. I have also seen this trend in many whitepapers. Most of them make use of Ethereum with off-chain data. I was just wondering if Hyperledger might have been secure enough for health records. I do understand it makes more sens to do it off-chain especially when you will also be dealing with files. 

My biggest issue at the moment is to cluster my Fabric network. I have been using Docker Swarm. I have come to a conclusion that I cant use docker-compose.yaml files on different nodes as they recreate the networks instead of joining.  My next steps are to use Kubernetes. 

What is the best way to cluster your Fabric network?  Hard coding IP addresses does not seem to be the answer. Setting up a DNS is also seems a bit extreme.

@Switch2Logic, apologies for the delay in getting back to you (I've been OOF, and just today catching up on unfinished thoughts ;) ).

The short answer is that for us, this is an unsolved issue, much as you've identified. We've been running our POCs across a virtual LAN, so haven't yet had to deal with the technical problem that you're describing. You may want to ask this question over on the #fabric channel, as I have to imagine that this is a pretty typical use case. If you do get a good response, please report back your findings. Thanks!

If you'd like to join the next #patient-member-subgroup session it is on Friday 6/22 @9am PST. We will be focused on defining the problem, creating personas and defining use scenarios (requirements gathering). I'm hoping it will be a template for other use cases. Also, I don't believe we have a clinical decision making use case built yet, so if you are interested in building that out, let me know and we can see if there are others that are interested in joining in. All use cases are here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/healthcare/healthcare-wg.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/healthcare-wg?msg=esLxBn5LgiCTypFTy) @KenAllgood Glad that the EHR use case is of interest! If you'd like to join the next #patient-member-subgroup session it is on Friday 6/22 @9am PST. We will be focused on defining the problem, creating personas and defining use scenarios (requirements gathering). I'm hoping it will be a template for other use cases. Calendar is here: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=linuxfoundation.org_nf9u64g9k9rvd9f8vp4vur23b0%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/SanFrancisco

Some food for thought for our next meeting: It would be very useful from a privacy standpoint if we could implement zero knowledge proofs in our EHR record to IPFS like file pointers. Zero knowledge proofs could help with the de- identification of records problem. However, this would require the healthcare providers supply clean ( de-indentified data files to point towards) to maintain the privacy custody of the records. Currently, medical files, lab/ reports have the patient name or record numbers embedded within the headers. This might require a change in process for health care records in general unless we find a way to remove this identifier across all records. Something to discuss for the build. Thanks!

@ayala 
Welcome to the workgroup. Glad to have you join us. Please tell us a bit about your interests in blockchain technologies, Hyperledger in particular, and your professional background.

As for your question... I don't know of any use case that you describe. It does sound quite interesting. My own background in the healthcare space puts emphasis on kidney care and dialysis, so I can very easily imagine your use case getting exercised in this domain. 

Thanks for the thought... and welcome to the group!

<p><strong>ayala</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 07:32:27 GMT):<br/>
Hello, sorry I did not introduce myself! My background is quite varied, I have worked as a digital manager in the payments industry as well as learning technologies. I am the founder of a company (Kippitech) based in Aberdeen, UK that delivers traceability projects, mainly so far in the Food and environmental sectors, but we have recently become interested in this health project as it relates to circular economy (as it aims to essentially recycling medical devices to help the public health system in Scotland). I am also the organiser of Hyperledger Madrid. Thanks for accepting me into the group!
</p>
<p><strong>ayala</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 07:36:49 GMT):<br/>
@richbl it is interesting to hear that this can be used on kidney care and dialysis. Do you have any examples of the kind of equipment that this can be put to use? If so, would the group be interested in working on this particular case study?

For the sake of documentation, the point I made on today's call was that I am looking to develop open-source tools to facilitate cryptocurrency payments across enterprise blockchain silos which are being developed.  I believe
</p>
<p><strong>jstollman</strong> (Fri, 06 Jul 2018 17:23:10 GMT):<br/>
1.  the enterprise blockchains will initial be a series of independent silos developed to attack specific use cases
</p>
<p><strong>jstollman</strong> (Fri, 06 Jul 2018 17:23:52 GMT):<br/>
2.  most applications will require a payment mechanism -- if only to pay transaction costs of operating the blockchain infrastructuree
</p>
<p><strong>jstollman</strong> (Fri, 06 Jul 2018 17:25:11 GMT):<br/>
3. crypto currencies enable instantaneous payments under terms that can be documented in chain code/smart contracts
</p>
<p><strong>jstollman</strong> (Fri, 06 Jul 2018 17:25:39 GMT):<br/>
4.  the use of cryptocurrencies will avoid the costs of invoicing and collections and ensure prompt payment
</p>
<p><strong>jstollman</strong> (Fri, 06 Jul 2018 17:27:10 GMT):<br/>
5.  enterprises won't want to have to hold a multitude of cyrptocurrencies -- one for each application (e.g., paying medical providers, paying office supply houses, paying for building rent or mortgages, etc.)
</p>
<p><strong>jstollman</strong> (Fri, 06 Jul 2018 17:27:58 GMT):<br/>
6.  enterprises will want to use a stable-value currency the removes the volatility risk of popular floating-value crypto currencies
</p>
<p><strong>jstollman</strong> (Fri, 06 Jul 2018 17:29:43 GMT):<br/>
But before even putting out such a currency, we need the open-source tools to enable payments from a small number of stable-value currency blockchains to a large number of siloed application blockchain apps.  And the currency blockchains will have to be the highest performing of all blockchains because almost every transaction on an application blockchain will likely trigger at least one transaction on the currency blockchain.
</p>
<p><strong>jstollman</strong> (Fri, 06 Jul 2018 17:30:09 GMT):<br/>
We are looking for teammates to help us with this mission.
</p>
<p><strong>richbl</strong> (Fri, 06 Jul 2018 17:35:47 GMT):<br/>
@jstollman, great to have you on the Patient Subgroup call today. Your idea of managing cryptocurrency payments is a good one, as much of what I imagine to be critical to the success of any blockchain solution is the valuation of data. In our context, it's patient data. That data needs to be valued using a some form of metric. Tokens are a good example of this, and would be used in a closed system that engages patient, payer, provider, etc. Stepping back a bit to a meta-level, I imagine that the work that you're doing permits the sharing of these valued datasets across enterprise domains. And the moment that this happens, you'll need a cross-domain means for the exchange of these currencies. Most interesting work!
</p>
<p><strong>A.Courtney</strong> (Fri, 06 Jul 2018 21:06:21 GMT):<br/>
Just looked through the string. Dialysis patient might make a great user case example for what we are creating. When they travel they still need care often with doctors who are unfamiliar with their ongoing case history if they should fall ill. Must make arrangements for dialysis where ever they go over 3-5 days and they generate a great deal of lab data over time that goes virtually unused by researchers. Same for a cancer patient. Just a thought as we try to drill down to a use case as our model for the build. Thoughts?
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/healthcare-wg?msg=YfrtAMNYNB5K7G4XQ) @A.Courtney I think that is a great idea Angela, and I think we have some group members that could speak well to this use case. Would we want to use this for the first one we build out at our next meeting?

Hey guys hope you are doing Great! 
I am to develop a Healthcare system. To book appointments and offer online appointment meeting through video call! meanwhile store the appointment and data as EHR in hyperledger fabric. 
Functionality in node/mongo :
- Search for Doctors.
- Make appointments.
- Online meetings
Functionality in Hyperledger fabric : 
- storing EHRs.
- Patients giving access to Doctors to EHR.
IS this model Right or need some changes? 
Thanks for your time. 
has any of you done it before! or any leads!

Hi, please see David’s email below, email me if you would like to collaborate. The deadline is July 16th.  (Email me at rebecafcampos at gmail)   	
Submitting CFP proposals for HIMSS 2019 - July 16 deadline 
From: David Boswell
Date: Mon, 09 Jul 2018 13:11:06 EDT 
The CFP deadline (July 16) is quickly approaching for HIMSS. It would be great if this group put together a few different talks and formats focused on interoperability and standards in healthcare and blockchain's role as well as real production deployments/use cases of Hyperledger in healthcare. HIMSS organizers accept two main talk formats:


Lecture

A 60 minute traditional, lecture-type conference education session in which a specific topic is presented and discussed. The presentation includes a brief question and answer period during the last 10 minutes of the session. No more than two speakers are permitted in this format.


Essential Conversation

A 60-minute education session which consists of a 20-minute lecture followed by 40 minutes of “Essential Conversation” with the audience. The goal of this session is to engage the audience in active learning and participation. The speaker(s) facilitate discussion by asking for comments and questions from the audience, allowing participants to contribute to the session content and drive their own learning. Attendees are able to hear the experiences of an entire room and listen to multiple perspectives on the same issue. This format will allow attendees to connect, challenge, question, inspire, motivate and learn together through the conversation and experiences of their


If you have an idea for a talk, please give us a heads up. You are more than welcome to pitch a talk that includes presenting with Hyperledger staff like Marta Piekarska or Tracy Kuhrt, but please do let us know. We can help fine tune, if need be and make sure that person is available and willing.


We’re always happy to help flesh ideas out. Please do get in touch with us at pr@hyperledger.org if you plan on submitting anything.


Thanks,

David

I'm Rayne. I'm a rural civil attorney in Illinois. I've been listening to the meeting recordings on the donor milk use case and have a couple thoughts.  There is a robust informal network of mothers sharing milk. If they had a way to go through some testing at the local lab and then get signed up to provide excess to the closest milk bank in exchange for pay, I think a lot of nursing moms would jump on that in a minute. Collecting and storing breastmilk is a PITA and most women aren't interested in doing that for free.  I see quite a bit of bartering in my own community.  I think it's impossible to know what supply would be out there if it was convenient and paid work. No one ever asked me in the years I was nursing what my excess capacity might have been.

   Hi All, I wanted to also post here in case people missed the email: https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/healthcare-wg/message/535

Here is the agenda for 8/17 meeting @9AM PST and a call for questions by 8/14 from our guest:

9am-9:30am: *We will have a guest, Naomi Bar-Yam, Executive Director of Milk Bank NE, to answer question regarding the challenges in the current donor milk ecosystem on supply/demand visibility and traceability* - Thanks to Anton Ansalmar from Rapid Healthcare for making that introduction
9:30am-10:50am: Angela Courtney, will share what she has learned so far in the early build she has done with Composer
9:50am-10am: wrap up and discuss next steps

  Please send over your questions for Naomi by 8/14 - I will be sending Naomi questions ahead of time so that she has time to review. Here are the questions that I have collected so far from Rich, Isaac, and Benjamin:

        What are the major challenges that donor banks are facing?
        What are the specific issues that drive the supply chain?
        Are there challenges with physically storing the milk in a secure manner? Is someone trying to make changes to the milk a risk?
        How is collaboration between Non-Profit, For Profit and COOP entities in the space?
        Do you engage at an international level with other donor organizations?
        How do you communicate your supply to hospitals and decide where your donations go?
        What actions are taken when contamination is detected?
        What data are already being collected by your systems for the donations and movement of the them?
        What legal/regulatory standards are you working with and what does the paperwork load look like to meet these requirements?

        We might not be able to address all of them with her, but I'm hoping that we can engage her for another call or she can refer us to someone else.

It would take 60,000 banks to fill the current need in U.S. hospitals now"

@raynedevivo 
Great to meet you, and thanks very much for your help on managing resources. You mentioned you're from Illinois. Whereabouts? I'm from the south suburbs of Chicago, though my family has since moved to St. Charles (western suburbs). That said, I'm been living here in Seattle for ~30 years, which means that I've lived in Seattle longer now than "back home." 

Again thanks, and welcome!

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/healthcare-wg?msg=wrhCfzS9gvBSqPC3s) One thing that I am pulling from this article is that visibility around pricing for the milk would be really helpful to help ensure equity across the market. Thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>richbl</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 15:08:00 GMT):<br/>
One interesting financial consideration that popped for me in that article was this quote: "Breast milk is a precious commodity with a value 150 times what cow’s milk costs." That's significant, and could be a driver to gain the attention of potential investors (read: a potentially very good business case).

That said, there's a significant political hurdle to manage in how to avoid the management of women for disparate socio-economic classes, as the related NYT article suggests (https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/21/business/breast-milk-products-commercialization.html). In short, if you pay women for their milk, it could be perceived as taking advantage of the disadvantaged. Worse still, your efforts could be interpreted as stealing food from someone's infant! A very charged and delicate space to be working in.
</p>
<p><strong>raynedevivo</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 15:26:28 GMT):<br/>
@richbl I live in central Illinois, in LeRoy, a small town between Bloomington and Champaign.  I went to law school in Champaign while my husband works at State Farm, so LeRoy was a nice mid point where we could get a lot of house for our money.  Now we have two boys in school here, so we are here to stay at least a few more years.  My husband is from the north suburbs, McHenry.

I know the area pretty well. I also went to school at UIUC, and did quite a bit of cycling in and around the area (though not quite that far NW). Beautiful open spaces. And flat too (which I definitely miss here in Seattle) :).

<p><strong>raynedevivo</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 15:41:56 GMT):<br/>
@richbl Hey, that's great! Glad to meet a fellow Illini.  A railroad company is taking out a very old line that goes along 150 from Bloomington to Champaign. It's just dirt now but soon it will be a wide paved bike trail the whole 45 miles.  The dirt path is good enough for my oldest and his friends though, now they have a way to safely travel to friends homes who live just outside town.  
</p>
<p><strong>richbl</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 15:46:16 GMT):<br/>
@raynedevivo very cool. Alas, I haven't been back on UIUC campus for many years. Glad to hear that things are evolving :).

<p><strong>raynedevivo</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 17:07:38 GMT):<br/>
From Naomi's org's website FAQ "How are milk banking standards set?

The Human Milk Banking Association of North America, or HMBANA, is the only professional association for nonprofit donor human milk banking in the United States and Canada. As such, it sets the standards and guidelines for donor milk banking in North America. It was founded in 1985 and in January 2017 had 26 member banks, including Mothers’ Milk Bank Northeast, plus 5 banks in development.

HMBANA certifies milk banks according to strict, evidence-based guidelines; encourages research into the unique properties of human milk and its uses; provides a forum for networking among experts in the field; acts as a liaison between member institutions and governmental regulatory agencies; and educates healthcare providers and the general public about the benefits and appropriate uses of banked human milk."

Hi everyone, summary of  our 8/17 patient subgroup call is here: https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/healthcare-wg/message/544 and the funding opportunity that Angela found is here: https://callforcode.org/ it would likely cause a branch off of the donor milk use case to make it applicable for commodities needed in disaster recovery scenarios, but it would be great to great some feedback :https://callforcode.org/

Hello everyone,
</p>
<p><strong>A.Courtney</strong> (Tue, 21 Aug 2018 22:50:54 GMT):<br/>
Just a reminder to go into the github repo and roll up your version of the breast- milk-network and create traders, new milk donations and make transactions. From a build (coding) standpoint, we need input on what essential parameters or fields should be present for each subsection ( traders, asset and transactions). These are the parameters that a user interface would need to query. All suggestions welcomed. Thanks!

The CDC issued a breastfeeding rates by state.  The data shows that over 57% of infants continue breastfeeding at 6 months.  This would include all infants, not just ones that started in the NICU.  https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/data/reportcard.htm

I've been listening to public sector meetings and there was a very good presentation on August 3 by the Canadian government about their project TheOrgBook which I thought was applicable to the last couple Payer meeting discussions. If you go to their wiki https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/public-sector-wg/public-sector-wg and watch the August 3 video from 26:30 to 53:00 that's the entire presentation, but there is a section about credential issuers, holders, and verifiers, using the ledger to gain access to services which seemed like a similar problem to Payer between 26:30 and 37:00

I couldn't find them at the public library, but if anyone has access to an academic library, that might be somewhere to look. For anyone in the Seattle area, I'm happy to review together once I have them in hand.

For those folks here newer to the healthcare space (or for those of us who have been around a while, and are still interested in a pretty good read), I wanted to share the following article on the fragmentation of healthcare data. You might imagine that our efforts here by way of Hyperledger will help to resolve some of the issues brought up in this article. Fingers crossed ;).

Welcome to the workgroup. Glad to have you join us. Please tell us a bit about your interests in blockchain technologies, Hyperledger in particular, and your professional background.

As for an answer to your question, there's nothing formally available that exists regarding vaccinations, but if you could tell us a bit more about your use case(s) and perhaps some requirements, I'm sure the community might be able to help out.

Again, welcome to the HLHCWG! :)

The way Rose runs the public sector meetings is: anti trust policy, then someone gives a 5 minute presentation on a hyperledger tool, then a SME talks for 15 minutes about what they do, then the working group talks to the SME until 10 til the hour. Then they plan for the next meeting and once that's done they spend the last few minutes asking the SME questions.

Good Afternoon All,

I wanted to share this announcement on our chat channel, though it also has gone out via "old school" email ;).

On behalf of the Hyperledger Health Care Working Group (HLHCWG), I wanted to share with you some timely information that could be extremely valuable to you as an active member of our Hyperledger community.

In short, the largest Hyperledger event of the year is coming up on December 12-15 in Basel, Switzerland. Here's a link to the website (https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/hyperledger-global-forum-2018/).

Looking over the current Forum agenda, there are several healthcare-related topics that will be discussed. Further, as many of us are still climbing the blockchain learning curve, this is a great opportunity to learn more about blockchain technologies in general, and Hyperledger and its related frameworks and toolsets in specific. And, of course, this is a great opportunity to meet healthcare colleagues working in the global healthcare blockchain space.

Happy to answer any questions you might have about participating in this forum event.

Thanks
Rich

Based on the Doodle poll, we are going to keep meeting times for the patient subgroup to every other Friday at 9-10am PST. You can copy the meeting on to your calendar here.

Regarding action items from last meeting, for me I have have not been able to review the HMBANA materials yet that I have received, but it is still on my to do list.

For this Friday, we will be reviewing the AsiaPac HIMSS Innovation Challenge submission that we have started for the donor milk use case. Thank you to everyone who has contributed to this as well as the donor milk use case wiki! The submission is due by EOD on 9/14, so this will be our only time to review. Please contribute if you can and let me know if you have any questions.

I should also add that this working group hosts regular telecons that specialize in several different areas of healthcare, including patient/member, payer, and EHR integration. I'd recommend that you might first want to join the general HLHCWG telecon, held every other Friday morning. Telecon details are available here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/healthcare/healthcare-wg.

In addition, you might also want to consider contacting HLHCWG membership via the email list, available here: healthcare-wg@lists.hyperledger.org. Additional details for using/accessing the mailing list are here: https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/healthcare-wg

Looking forward to having you join the team!

I would like to tell a little bit more over my Use Case that I belive that Hyperledger is good for
</p>
<p><strong>ultimo2020</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 19:16:41 GMT):<br/>
I believe that the vaccine supply chain is an optimal test environment for blockchain in development.
</p>
<p><strong>ultimo2020</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 19:16:56 GMT):<br/>
Immunization supply chains in many developing countries share common checkpoints despite procurement from multiple manufacturers, with most vaccines being routed through Global-managed central stores on their way to regional and local warehouses.
</p>
<p><strong>ultimo2020</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 19:17:40 GMT):<br/>
Besides information such as vaccine type, manufacture date and destination, additional data can be securely added to the blockchain from devices such as next-generation vaccine vial monitors and cold chain equipment, to help visualize exactly when and where a temperature excursion or other adverse event may have happened.
The Stakeholders included: manufacturers, managers, logisticians, healthcare workers, government officials, and international organizations.
</p>
<p><strong>ultimo2020</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 19:18:15 GMT):<br/>
One of the goals of Blockchain improvements should be a quantifiable reduction in vaccine product wastage, leading to improved procurement against demand, sustained high levels of consumer trust of vaccines, more children fully vaccinated with viable product, and consequently, greater aversion of vaccine-preventable child morbidity and mortality.
</p>
<p><strong>ultimo2020</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 19:19:38 GMT):<br/>
I believe that this can be done via Hyperledger Composer and Fabric, using also IoT sensors for temperature and Geopositioning
</p>
<p><strong>ultimo2020</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 19:19:55 GMT):<br/>

Good Afternoon HLHCWG Team,

I trust that you've had a great and productive week. Here in Seattle, the weather's certainly in transition, and the rain-showers of the autumn season have begun. 

As many of you may know, the Hyperledger Healthcare Working Group (HLHCWG) came into formal existence just about one year ago with the initial publication of our HLHCWG Charter (https://www.hyperledger.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HealthcareWGCharter_public.pdf). With so much change in this industry between then and now, and using that hindsight to help set direction going forward, it's time to review and discuss this important guiding document. As part of that discussion, we may want to consider whether the current complement of HLHCWG subgroups is sufficient in addressing anticipated healthcare blockchain needs in the foreseeable future.

I'd also like to use our time to continue the excellent discussions initiated at our last General Meeting (9/7), including: 

- Academic involvement in the Hyperledger Project, specifically as they relate to the healthcare domain
- The current availability of blockchain framework evaluation papers and resources
- Bringing Hyperledger learning resources to this working group to better our team education of the Hyperledger umbrella of frameworks, tools, and community services

With that said, here's next week's proposed HLHCWG General Meeting agenda for FR (9/21):

------

A. Welcome and Opening Statement
- Reading of the Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy (https://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy)

B. Team Introductions
- Please introduce yourself, where you're geographically located, and your interests in healthcare in general, and blockchain technologies in specific

C. Announcements
- Feel free to share community announcements as they relate to the Hyperledger community

D. Old Business
- Academic involvement in the Hyperledger Project, specifically within healthcare (status and updates)
- Availability of blockchain framework evaluation papers and resources (status and updates)
- Bringing Hyperledger learning resources to the HLHCWG (status and updates)

E. New Business
- A review of the HLHCWG Charter (https://www.hyperledger.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HealthcareWGCharter_public.pdf)
- A discussion of new HLHCWG subgroups

F. Next Meeting
- A short discussion of pertinent topics for our next HLHCWG General Meeting

Please feel free to recommend changes to this proposed agenda.

------

As a reminder, our HLHCWG General Meetings are scheduled every other Friday (bi-weekly) at 0700 PST as a telecon using Zoom. Connect details, and excellent HLHCWG background resource information can be accessed on our community wiki here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/healthcare/healthcare-wg.

Finally, please be sure to stay engaged with the HLHCWG team between meetings using our Rocket.Chat channel, located here: https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/healthcare-wg.

Have a great weekend, and I hope to see you at our next meeting!

Good Afternoon HLHCWG Team,

I trust that you've had a great and productive week. Here in Seattle, the weather's certainly in transition, and the rain-showers of the autumn season have begun. 

As many of you may know, the Hyperledger Healthcare Working Group (HLHCWG) came into formal existence just about one year ago with the initial publication of our HLHCWG Charter (https://www.hyperledger.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HealthcareWGCharter_public.pdf). With so much change in this industry between then and now, and using that hindsight to help set direction going forward, it's time to review and discuss this important guiding document. As part of that discussion, we may want to consider whether the current complement of HLHCWG subgroups is sufficient in addressing anticipated healthcare blockchain needs in the foreseeable future.

I'd also like to use our time to continue the excellent discussions initiated at our last General Meeting (9/7), including: 

- Academic involvement in the Hyperledger Project, specifically as they relate to the healthcare domain
- The current availability of blockchain framework evaluation papers and resources
- Bringing Hyperledger learning resources to this working group to better our team education of the Hyperledger umbrella of frameworks, tools, and community services

With that said, here's next week's proposed HLHCWG General Meeting agenda for FR (9/21):

------

A. Welcome and Opening Statement
- Reading of the Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy (https://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy)

B. Team Introductions
- Please introduce yourself, where you're geographically located, and your interests in healthcare in general, and blockchain technologies in specific

C. Announcements
- Feel free to share community announcements as they relate to the Hyperledger community

D. HLHCWG Subgroup Updates
- Patient/Member Subgroup (Marissa Iannarone, Lead)
- Payer Subgroup (Raveesh Dewer, Lead)
- EMR Subgroup (Robert Chu, Lead)

E. Old Business
- Academic involvement in the Hyperledger Project, specifically within healthcare (status and updates)
- Availability of blockchain framework evaluation papers and resources (status and updates)
- Bringing Hyperledger learning resources to the HLHCWG (status and updates)

F. New Business

From this morning's listserv email:

Good Morning,

I wanted to share with you an opportunity for our HLHCWG to meet face-to-face at an upcoming healthcare event.

The Distributed Health 2018 Conference (https://health.distributed.com/) is happening in early November, and leadership within the Hyperledger Project has asked if anyone from our WG is planning to attend. 

If you are, indeed, planning to attend, and we have enough HLHCWG members to make it worthwhile, our hope would be to formalize a physical HLHCWG working meeting at the conference so that membership can meet face-to-face, further developing our healthcare community within the Hyperledger Project.

So, if you're expecting to attend this conference, please contact me, or respond to my listserv email, so we can tally attendees, and plan accordingly.

Thanks
</p>

Ireland is in a donor milk crisis.  The one milk bank had to shut down to due to contaminated milk.  Water used at the plant is the cause.  https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-45566718  When we look at quality in the donor milk supply chain, how could we help solve this real life issue?

Good Morning All,

I just received some good news regarding the upcoming Hyperledger Global Forum. As you might recall, on 9/12 I sent out an general announcement to this WG, and I received some very good feedback from membership. In fact, our own Marissa Iannarone, lead for the Patient Subgroup, will be attending this event as a healthcare panel moderator.

As as update, if you're planning to attend this inaugural event, the good news is that we now have a discount code to share with you...

Receive a 15% discount when registering using the code HGF18LFP.

Details here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XFwfy7sb-fpLNpivgsChk_a8yADbjLRWDFMaAHx0irM/edit#slide=id.g40f74581ed_0_29

It would be worth researching the extent to which Hyperledger tools support -- or can be further extended to support -- this integration model. I would propose going beyond an API-oriented approach to a more robust service-oriented set of standards.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/healthcare-wg?msg=PzEcvcdDrrn7zdG95) @richbl moi - Quite a bit of what we (Cognitive) do is around interoperability - from HL7 FHIR and CIMMI to standard terminologies like SNOMED-CT, LOINC, RxNORM.  One of the projects I would like to promote would be SMART-on-FHIRChain - a dApp that would allow api interaction with the ledger
FHIR provides the model syntax but the data (e.g. codeable concepts) need to be interoperable as well.
</p>
<p><strong>melias11</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 23:28:07 GMT):<br/>
Terminology confusion : Assets vs Resources  --- The concept of asset seems to be deeply embedded in the Hyperledger lexicon and is pervasive throughout documentation, code and WG discussions. However, it seems inappropriate for most use cases beyond certain areas of finance or accounting. The concept of resource seems more appropriate. For example, in a carbon trading market, a ton of carbon would be considered a liability rather than an asset. Likewise, medical waste in need of disposal would not be viewed as an asset.  Is there a process whereby this issue can be raised with the platform development team to ensure review at the appropriate level?
</p>
<p><strong>melias11</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 23:35:55 GMT):<br/>
Conceptual confusion : "Smart Contracts"  --- This also seems like an inadvertent carry over from a more narrowly scoped initial set of use cases. Much of what we may use Fabric for in healthcare is not likely to involve smart contracts as commonly (mis-)understood. Is it reasonable to request adoption of a more neutral or precise concept as the platform evolves?

Welcome to the workgroup, and glad to have you join us. Please tell us a bit about your interests in blockchain technologies, Hyperledger in particular, and your professional background.

Great to hear that you're interested in working on the Milk Bank POC. As a reminder, the next HLHCWG Patient Subgroup telecon is scheduled for this Friday (9/28) at 0900 (PST). Details for the telecon can be found on the WG wiki, https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/healthcare/healthcare-wg.

Again, welcome to the HLHCWG! :)

Welcome to the workgroup, and glad to have you join us. Please tell us a bit about your interests in blockchain technologies, Hyperledger in particular, and your professional background.

To your questions: you'll want to get on the calls with the Patient/Member Subgroup to discuss the details of your question re: FHIR. We're currently working with an outside party to help define and guide the project. You're input will be valued there. @Mari499 is the person to contact, or check out our HLHCWG wiki at https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/healthcare/healthcare-wg.

Regarding terminology, these are both good points to raise (though I'd beg to differ with you re: smart contracts, though perhaps it's strictly terminology that're flagging?). If you'd like to pursue the idea, you can either ask to have it added to our bi-weekly meeting agenda as a talking point (I can help out with that), and/or you can jump over to the #fabric channel and bring the issue up directly with the dev folks more directly involved in that particular project. 

Thinking about it, it may be a bit difficult to do a bit of context-switching between terminology if/when you're in a healthcare context vs. elsewhere (e.g., fintech). But... there may indeed be better concept labels out there that need improvement.

Again, welcome to the HLHCWG! :)

@Steven_Elliott 
Great to know we have an expert in our midst ;). And great point made in your last statement re: data interoperability. I suspect you may be referring to FHIR data conformance and profiles (e.g., Argonaut). This is a consideration often overlooked, and your distinction is spot on! Hoping to have you more involved as we grow our HLHCWG projects.

Good Morning All,

A bit of an odd question to pose, but I thought I'd "crowd-source" this to those much smarter than myself.

I'll be moderating a healthcare panel at an upcoming blockchain summit in Seattle later this month (http://blockchainnw.com/). So, I'd like to ask if you have any questions about the use of blockchain in healthcare that you'd like to see answered if you were sitting in the audience.

Some initial questions:

- What makes blockchain technologies particularly valuable in the healthcare space?
- Where do you see blockchain most appropriately utilized?
- What are some of the barriers to entry with implementing blockchain technologies in the healthcare space?

Thanks for your help!

Reposting the response to @richbl's request on the mailing list. 

It would be hard to add something that is out of the scope of the three initial questions that you listed because they are concerned with the why, where and how of the application of this technology to healthcare. I’ll try and list some questions that I’ve thinking about and maybe that would add value to your preparation for this conference, however, please let me add a disclaimer that I don’t consider myself any wiser for posting them and I hope that I can get some answers to these and improve my understanding of where we can go with this technology. 

In my opinion, the crux of the problems that U.S. healthcare faces today can be encapsulated into the cost of care problem, quality of care problem and the coverage problem. And these three problems are connected. I will try and list out these problems in brief, which will help lead into the promises of blockchain technology to solve these problems and then pose questions that may inform us regarding applying it successfully to achieve the end goal of better healthcare. 

The cost of care problem can be broken further down into the over utilization of services problem, the high cost of services problem, and the high administrative overhead problem. There is over utilization of services in healthcare today as shown by these examples: about 3 in 10 tests are reordered, 30% of the patients who visit the doctors office have their files missing and because doctors, practicing defensive medicine, order tests and services which might not be needed. It has been argued that over utilization is also a result of misaligned incentives for the providers and the data-brokers involved. Especially, in cases of patients with comorbidity, the patient data residing with one provider is not available to another one. 

Which leads directly into the quality of care problem. Since provider don’t have access to a longitudinal health record for the patient; they have no choice but to have their patients fill out forms. And, there is risky reliance on the patient to remember their health history, which in several cases has proven harmful for provider, patients and ultimately everyone since we all share the cost. And on that note, consider that every provider fills out 20k forms each year and the healthcare industry in total pays for 15 billion transactions on the fax machine.  

Again, providers don’t have access to the longitudinal health record because of the misaligned incentives of the data-brokers in the healthcare ecosystem. It has been argued that the interoperability problem in healthcare is a business model problem. The cost of care also affects the quality of care in the sense that there is not enough incentives for most providers to practice preemptive/preventative health which is the major cause of concern for health of people in America in my opinion with 1 in 3 suffering from obesity, 1 in 3 from diabetes, 1 in 4 from cardiovascular problem, 1 in 5 from mental health problems - all that can be root-caused to behavior & lifestyle and further lead to other more serious health issues. Having more sick people further exacerbates the problem as there are limited number of doctors who can see them and we loop back into the cost of care problem and quality of care problems because small number of physicians charge higher salaries and don’t have enough time too see patients. 

The coverage problem is that either most people in America don’t have coverage or are not directly involved in choosing coverage because they get it form their employer, medicare or medicaid. Which again loops back into the cost of care problem because there is over-utilization as people don’t pay for these services directly. A more fundamental disturbing truth is the very existence of the payer, separate from the provider and the consumer, which leads to administrative burdens for all parties involved through costs of pre-authorizations, billing, claims, disputes, waste, fraud all adding to the cost of care problem, quality of care problem and ultimately since there is expensive care at low quality, the coverage problem. 

All of these problems bubble up in the form of metrics like, low life expectancy for Americans, high infant mortality rate, high rate of preventable diseases and the most glaring one - an expensive healthcare system paying ~20% in GDP for healthcare that works worse than other countries who pay much less.

While there have been solutions proposed to these problems viz. new forms of coverage and new provider payment models, I think they don’t have the disruptive potential of blockchains. The central promise of blockchains is in decentralization which for the healthcare industry means disintermediation, reduction of waste, smart incentives, trust amongst stakeholders and hence reduction of fraud. Which could mean a lot and I think can change the industry in many ways but I realize that this post is already going much longer than I intended so I’d jump right to the questions that I’ve been thinking about. 

How can blockchain technology, today, help in coordination of care amongst multiple providers for a patient with comorbidity? What are the roadblocks there? 

What are the ramifications of issuing and verifying provider credentials through the blockchain? 

How are the data-brokers in the healthcare industry responding to this technology - the HIEs, EHRs, EMRs, population health managers. What are their next steps? 

Why is the industry still using fax and lengthy pre-authorization processes? What is the trust problem there? 

Should blockchains be applied depth first or breadth first. In, other words, should be try to fix entity specific problems (provider, payers, employers) or patient specific problems i.e. create blockchain solutions for a specific condition which is more problematic due to the nature of the US healthcare industry?

Are there particular types of health problems (mental, cardiovascular, diabetes etc.) which cause more waste in the industry than other and should be tackled first? 

How do we apply Blockchains to incentivize healthy behavior and promote preventative healthcare and wellness? Is there any work going on in the industry on that front?

Thanks for having me. I am glad to be part of this group. My interest blockchain technologies is largely due to their potential in transforming how we organize ourselves. I have a background in technology and digital health, having worked at a startup in this field - HealthTap. I came across Hyperledger at HIMSS17, it was a small booth then, but I could see the role this community can play transforming health and healthcare.

<p><strong>richbl</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 23:53:18 GMT):<br/>
@KaranVerma 
Great to have you, and I hope we can get you more actively involved in this WG, as we're a fast-growing group of professionals from very diverse backgrounds with a common interest in helping to improve healthcare (globally) through the judicious and intelligent application of blockchain technologies when applicable. In my own case, my background is in systems/software engineering (10 years at Microsoft, another 10 years working US government contracts for the DoD/military sectors, and these past ~8 years in healthcare). I also happen to be a chronic disease patient (chronic kidney disease), and am a long-time volunteer of the creator of outpatient kidney dialysis, Northwest Kidney Centers--the third largest non-profit kidney care organization in the US--which happens to be located right here in Seattle. So, healthcare is my interest at numerous levels.

Finally, interesting to hear about your observation at HIMSS17. I attended this year's HIMMS18 in Las Vegas, and manned one of the Hyperledger booths. My observation from those with whom I spoke was that blockchain as a concept was still really just out of reach for most IT professionals (at least those with whom I spoke). While I had expected to "talk tech" about the various Hyperledger frameworks/tools, the vast majority of my time was spent explaining blockchain at a much higher, abstracted level. This is, no doubt, part of the ramp of early understanding incurred with any new technology. 
</p>
<p><strong>KaranVerma</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 00:01:58 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for sharing your background and I appreciate your engagement in this from the standpoint of your situation, experience and skills. I am looking forward to learning about how to get more involved. Also, I empathize with your points about these technologies being hard to explain.

@richbl I am responding in-chat as you suggested. I thought the response by @KaranVerma was excellent, so I'll add just a couple of items for consideration and a few resources that may be of use. For supply chain, I'll offer how blockchain maps to the key requirements of the DSCSA (Drug Supply Chain Security Act) as well as an at-a-glance table of entities using blockchain for broader health supply chain management as two low-time-intensive ways to generate some specific questions: https://blockchainhealthcaretoday.com/index.php/journal/article/view/20/7. Also to an earlier comment, I agree that provider identities / credentialing is a critical use case; Procredex and TxMQ are probably the two most advanced in that space: https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12942-018-0144-x. Finally, I would recommend a question about how their blockchain build/consensus mechanism fits with the healthcare problem they are trying to solve. So for Clinicoin (who I think will be there, although perhaps not on the panel) it may asking be how their use Proof of Engagement and validators can create incentive alignment to facilitate health behavior change compared to conventional approaches.

@richbl Also, as a belated means of an introduction, I am a longtime lurker on the mailing list and originally signed up for it at Distributed Health in 2016 back when the WG was just an interest list at the Hyperledger table. My background is in healthcare as a pharmacist and digital health researcher. We started looking at blockchain for supply chain in 2015 and it has been a pretty interesting ride since then. Since I am based at a university, we also started teaching about blockchain in our pharmacy and health care informatics programs a couple of years ago, completed a gateway project using blockchain for degree verification, and have some students in pharmacy, health care informatics and CS interested in resources to become more active and proficient with Hyperledger. We even had a student team create a vaccination verification build for a blockchain hackathon about a year ago, which I saw was another topic touched on here.  I really appreciate the work and resources that have been shared in this mailing list over time, even if I haven't chimed in to say so. I will be at Distributed Health in November (as well as Consensus Health Summit in DC, ConV2X at Columbia University, etc. this month) and am always happy to meet others doing exciting work in this space. Please feel free to reach out and/or to add me to your aforementioned tally.

The pharma supply chain (and as I learned recently, aspects of it referred to as serialization) seems to be a great use case that I really hadn't heard about just recently. Add to that the DSCSA, which effectively suggests government support, and this gets exciting rather quickly. Great insight. Thanks too for your question recommendation about consensus mechanisms.

This may be an ideal time to develop a new business case around healthcare supply chain management - perhaps starting with pharmaceuticals or vaccines. I would strongly recommend the latter. From a patient life-course perspective, vaccination represents a logical progression in terms of building on our starting point with human milk. The focus is narrower and better defined, making it easier to quantify problems, risks and benefits -- whereas pharmaceuticals and supply chains in general may be too broad and unwieldy for us to tackle at this point. The progression from human milk -> vaccines -> drugs -> general supply chains would  enable us to leverage resources most effectively, and could allow us to make a compelling case for funding and research support for longitudinal, long-term birth cohort-based effectiveness research -- perhaps in India rather than the USA, since the need is more urgent, the potential impact far greater and the industry less encumbered by the current politics of health data sharing.

Vital statistics : birth and death records 

In addition to human milk/breastfeeding and vaccinations, I would like to propose we focus upcoming work on birth and death records. Vital statistics are the foundation of all healthcare systems, and a core public health service. 

Birth records are critically important to establishing identity and the quality of this information can dramatically impact virtually all interaction with public and private services delivery systems -- and over the entire human lifespan -- especially as these become increasingly digitalized. 

The coming decades are expected to involve massive unplanned cross-border migration flows due to climate-related disruption to environments and socioeconomic systems. 

Reliable, fault-tolerant identity management capabilities will become increasingly important to ensuring security and stability worldwide.

If @Zeljko Milinovic is still examining this, I may be able to connect to a physicians group in UK working in travel medicine that expressed interest in our students vaccinations + blockchain efforts. Ultimately, the students decided launching a startup on top of completing dual doctoral-masters degrees was not possible so did not pursue. But the opportunity may still be there for someone.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/healthcare-wg?msg=Ewprz2sGkQ6oDYGfX) @VipinB Thanks for the link -- we currently have this paper on the wiki : 
https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/healthcare/publications-whitepapers

The work we are currently engaged in aims to develop more detailed, quantitative analytical models around specific problem areas and potential impacts from adoption of blockchain solutions. For example, quantifying the benefits to each party within a multi-stakeholder network from adopting the donor milk platform, and using this model to support benefit-cost or other investment decision-making by whomever would finance implementation of these solutions.

Quantitative work is extremely difficult... how are you going to measure emergent effects?

If Satoshi had done quantitative modeling before releasing the bitcoin core and his paper, we might not still have bitcoin as well as the whole blockchain ecosystem. We should proceed in incremental steps, do some rough analysis based on the flow diagram in the paper or some other means (we can always refine this as we go) and then try to model and build your solution in an agile manner, analysis paralysis should be avoided at all costs.

@raynedevivo thanks. I did not follow the link earlier as I had read Gideons work before

I agree that you do have to do cost-benefit analysis for getting funding or getting people interested in your project. Often this means proceeding with some projections. No need to make up numbers or be untruthful, proceed with information that you have and then attach some kind of Expectation to each of these. In other words be realistic with info that you have; no amount of math nor models can make for precision in predictions; having lived through the 2008 and other crashes, some of it fueled by the irrational exuberance due to undue reliance on mathematical modeling. Anyway enough said! Just wanted to put this view forward.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/healthcare-wg?msg=ZZAvLMrn6xW7J6xsu) @VipinB Thanks - great input! I believe the goal is to draw as much as possible from the existing research base from specific healthcare domains, and eventually to establish a more formal framework to enable independent quantitative research into the impact of blockchain-based interventional projects, led (hopefully) by academic partnerships. 

For example, there is already a fairly well established and credible body of clinical effectiveness research and well-established policies and guidelines into the benefits of human milk and public health research focused on quantifying the magnitude of the need at a population-level, which can help drive market analysis.

This would allow us to more effectively market these type of platform solutions, and attract a broader ecosystem of application development partners interested in leveraging the common infrastructure.

For example, there is already a fairly well established and credible body of clinical effectiveness research and well-established policies and guidelines into the benefits of human milk, along with public health research focused on quantifying the magnitude of the need at a population-level, which can help drive market analysis.  We have begun documenting sources on the wiki, but would benefit greatly from greater domain expertise in synthesizing this knowledge into use cases with well-defined quantitative current-state and projected future-state metrics.

Going forward, we would ideally rely on rapid, agile iterations and pilot studies to continuously refine the solutions, while bearing in mind that agile and continuous delivery methodologies need to coexist with research protocols - especially case-control interventional models -- that require some degree of stability during the timeframe of study in order to generate meaningful and replicable results. 

The detailed focus on methodology at the moment should be framed more broadly, given the other workgroups also getting underway - public sector and social impact, and the goal of eventually integrating our efforts. Analysis paralysis is not a concern - there is a huge sense of urgency around rapid mobilization of resources to address a large, complex set of challenges relating to sustainability and climate-related threats -- at least outside the USA. The bigger risk is poorly coordinated action.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/healthcare-wg?msg=ZZAvLMrn6xW7J6xsu) @VipinB Thanks - great input! I believe the goal is to draw as much as possible from the existing research base from specific healthcare domains, and eventually to establish a more formal framework to enable independent quantitative research into the impact of blockchain-based interventional projects, led (hopefully) by academic partnerships. 

This would allow us to more effectively market these type of platform solutions, and attract a broader ecosystem of application development partners interested in leveraging the common infrastructure.

For example, there is already a fairly well established and credible body of clinical effectiveness research and well-established policies and guidelines into the benefits of human milk, along with public health research focused on quantifying the magnitude of the need at a population-level, which can help drive market analysis.  There is no reason to make estimates or guesses given this rich body of evidence. Traceability, verification and validation are the more important concerns. We have begun documenting sources on the wiki, but would benefit greatly from greater domain expertise in synthesizing this knowledge and linking/applying evidence-based rationales to use cases in order to produced well-defined quantitative current-state and projected future-state metrics.

Going forward, we would ideally rely on rapid, agile iterations and pilot studies to continuously refine the solutions, while bearing in mind that agile and continuous delivery methodologies need to coexist with research protocols - especially case-control interventional models -- that require some degree of stability during the timeframe of study in order to generate meaningful and replicable results. 

The detailed focus on methodology at the moment should be framed more broadly, given the other Hyperledger workgroups also getting underway - public sector and social impact, and the goal of eventually integrating our efforts. Analysis paralysis is not a concern - some people are analysts and some are methodologists, and they should be encouraged to focus their attention on their areas of expertise. 

It would still be a great outcome if all we accomplished was generating whitepapers and domain analyses, provided these served as inputs to a broader ecosystem of developers -- and more importantly, standardization initiatives -- working on the actual technical solutions and commercial products. 

We would then benefit from having a framework to evaluate multiple competing vendor solutions - perhaps by working with public and private financing and investment entities. For example, the EU  has long-term programs such as Horizon 2020 and numerous incubator/accelerator networks to achieve these goals. Where these initiatives tend to fail almost universally is when political interference results in cobbling together truly lousy infrastructure design models that fail to achieve meaningful adoption and use and squander time, resources and good will.

On a different topic, does anyone know of work either planned or underway into use of alternative block models in Fabric? Instead of key-value pairs, is anyone working on RDF triples, for example? I found one or two papers online exploring this concept, but focusing on bitcoin/ethereum. Could this be a viable model for storing healthcare metadata, and has anyone researched the pros and cons of key-value pairs vs triples more formally? Would this be a good academic research project to undertake?

Could this be a viable model for storing healthcare metadata, and has anyone researched the pros and cons of key-value pairs vs triples more formally? Not having undertaken a detailed study of the Fabric codebase, I'm not sure whether this would represent a radical departure from the current architecture, or whether it could be an evolutionary enhancement. Could the smart contract subsystem support a SPARQL query engine?  Are there scale or performance-related concerns?

Would this be a good academic research project to undertake?

Interesting subject-predicate-object vs key-value.  RDF isn't healthcare specific although SNOMED, LOINC and RxNORM are ontologies that support is-a relationships.  A richer semantic than key-value for sure.  Generally ontologies define the terms and relationships of concepts in a domain.  Could you use something like SKOS or FoF and a library of terms to come up with an ontology for domains other than healthcare so there could be a broader application of RDF in a ledger system?
</p>
<p><strong>melias11</strong> (Tue, 09 Oct 2018 00:35:18 GMT):<br/>
There is a lot of ontology work underway across virtually all industry domains - a lot of it sponsored by the EU and being undertaken by various European universities and academic consortia. Some of it may be driven by the mandate to support multiple member state languages within official institutions and work activities of the EU, and perhaps increasingly to support industry digitalization, e-government initiatives and development of smart cities. 

OWL/RDF are still the primary linked-data languages and there seems to be strong strategic support for R&D involving semantic interoperability, even as AI applications involving semantic reasoners have been replaced with artificial neural networks. The best strategy may be to begin with domain-independent 'upper ontologies' and develop an extension model for specific domains. Better tools and methodologies would greatly facilitate this work.

This may be a great topic for a collaborative project with the Public Sector and Social Impact WGs. We should expect and be prepared for interoperability requirements spanning multiple industry domains going forward.

This is one of the better ontology catalogs - focused on smart-cities : 
http://smartcity.linkeddata.es/

This one focuses on IoT but includes a large number of papers across numerous domains :
http://lov4iot.appspot.com/?p=ontologies

It may be of value to establish some type of public domain registry of 'smart' domain models that are linked to a catalog of standardized, blockchain-based interoperability use cases -- a set of resources that can be more readily accessed by app developers and which flatten the otherwise steep learning curve associated with SNOMED, especially for those new to healthcare. 

To promote active and widespread participation by analysts and modelers in the design and contribution of domain models toward this type of decentralized, shared knowledge base and infrastructure platform evolution, the domain modelers could be provided with easy-to-use visual modeling tools and incentivized using some type of token of good will. 

Having a large, distributed ecosystem of modelers has the potential to greatly accelerate development of comprehensive health system-wide solutions, as well as solutions spanning multiple domains requiring some degree of integration - whether for market platforms and supply-chains or e-government platforms. That could free up resources to focus on more challenging work - like policy modeling and design tools, which may drive significant innovation in legal informatics and computational law.

With only 12 years remaining until the 2030 target, and in light of newly-updated and fairly dismal climate model projections, we're going to have to find new ways to accelerate the scale-out of these type of IT infrastructure solutions,.

There was no Payor meeting today, so if you have an assigned topic from Jeff's dissection of the world economic forum flow chart last week, it remains assigned for Oct 16.  If there are any links or presentations you would like inserted into the last few meeting notes, send them my way.

There appear to be a growing number of 'smart' breast pumps on the market these days. Would the POC benefit from incorporating an IoT device to demonstrate full end-to-end traceability?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/healthcare-wg?msg=PPvmNb53422Wm774Z) @melias11 I think this is a great future state consideration for the product. In addition to IoT for temperature control, this is another aspect to look at. I think for MVP it is out of scope, but that's why our documentation is going to be so helpful!

Hi - Some additional wiki updates to review during this morning's conference call... the system model now includes several new diagrams that summarize the key services, workflows and actors/roles.

The near-term goal is to improve communication between stakeholders using simplified visual representations without sacrificing details obtained thus far from SME interviews, analysis of guidelines and the scientific evidence-base; ensuring good bidirectional traceability is a second key goal.

Longer-term goals include prototyping possible collaboration tools, as well as visual modeling, analysis, design and planning tools, which may include configuration, code generation and testing capabilities.

Before embarking on creation of epics and stories using JIRA, it would be ideal if we could engage our SMEs in one more round of review and validation of our understanding of the system as currently documented via the wiki.

Time-permitting, it would be good to briefly review the following :
https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/healthcare/human_milk_services_model

https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/healthcare/perinatal_services
https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/healthcare/human_milk_donor_services
https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/healthcare/human_milk_recipient_services

The documentation is still incomplete and includes errors and navigation glitches, but the overall collaboration system model is roughly in place.

Feel free to send questions and feedback.

Mikhail

The model places important emphasis on role and relationship policy as applied to actors, groups and organizations, and to services systems within combined public and private policy contexts. The goal is to develop an integrated workflow and policy framework that can facilitate the design and implementation of 'smart contracts' or policy execution engines.

The last sentence of the first paragraph could be simplified for non-technical audiences, and applied to the healthcare industry more precisely... perhaps along the lines of: "blockchain technology provides an opportunity to strengthen the reliability and trustworthiness of the information infrastructure that regional and national healthcare delivery systems rely upon to ensure effective communication and coordination of health service delivery by multiple independent organizations. "

Interesting article in today's Guardian about human milk and the UK NHS : 
https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/oct/15/why-i-share-my-breast-milk-with-other-mothers

The analysis of problems covered in the article echoes findings from the USA. Supply shortages seem to be driving informal exchanges via social media. The extremely high treatment cost of necrotizing enterocolitis versus donor network expansion is noteworthy. A compelling case could be made for assembling a consortium consisting of the NHS, charitable foundations and milk banks in order to strengthen the supply chain. 

Should we seek a parallel pilot site in the UK for developing/testing the solution? Perhaps they have sufficiently recovered from the CfH program to attempt another national health IT infrastructure modernization program?

A good article summarizing a recent assessment of maternal and child nutrition programs in India : 
https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2018/10/01/how-india-can-improve-its-take-home-rations-program-to-boost-child-and-maternal-nutrition/

This would be an ideal follow up -- and logical progression -- to the human milk use case. Blockchain seems particularly well-suited to the problems described, especially involving management and accountability. 

With a stunting rate of 38% (50 million children), and over half of the annual program budget wasted, the potential to demonstrate ROI and contribute toward a positive macroeconomic impact  - especially in light of recent findings/debate regarding the newly introduced Human Capital Index - is especially significant. 

A  related opportunity involves the sourcing of the supplementary dietary formulation. This past year has seem several scandals where these programs have been hijacked by poorly-regulated food producers providing poor quality processed food products, often displacing producers offering healthier, locally grow and prepared offerings. A combined health, nutrition and agri-food platform solution that promotes healthier diets while relying on - and strengthening - local agricultural systems and supply-chains could significantly improve progress toward the 2030 goals.

https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2018/10/01/how-india-can-improve-its-take-home-rations-program-to-boost-child-and-maternal-nutrition/

This would be an ideal follow up -- and logical progression -- to the human milk use case. Blockchain seems well-suited to the problems described, particularly those involving management and accountability. 

With a stunting rate of 38% (50 million children), and over half of the annual program budget wasted, the potential to demonstrate ROI and contribute toward a positive macroeconomic impact  - especially in light of recent findings/debate regarding the newly introduced Human Capital Index - is significant. 

A  related opportunity involves the sourcing of the supplementary dietary formulation. This past year has seen several scandals where these programs have been hijacked by unregulated food producers providing poor quality processed food products, often displacing healthier, locally grown and prepared offerings. This trend is alarming given rapidly escalating rates of NCDs, growing evidence confirming the negative impact of junk food in early childhood,  and increasing entrenchment of poor quality, highly-processed foods and food product manufacturers.

A combined health, nutrition and agri-food platform solution that promotes healthier diets while relying on - and strengthening - local agricultural systems and supply-chains could significantly improve progress toward the 2030 goals.

For the Donor Milk Use Case Epic/Story/Task creation session. we didn't get much participation on the doodle poll for our JIRA Epic/Task creation session, but I am targeting tomorrow 10/18 at 10am PST to work on this. I'll get it on the community calendar as soon as I can. Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks to @A.Courtney and @melias11 on the discussion of scope and approach for tasks for the #DonorMilk PoC. From a high level we identified 3 work streams: domain analysis (what we have on the wiki so far), Epic/task/backlog tracking on JIRA, and Developers taking on tasks from JIRA to implement the work. We see these all working in parallel. For the PoC specifically, we confirmed that scope is the path of taking the milk asset through the 'donate milk' and 'receive milk' scenarios that Mikhail has above.

For next steps Mikhail will work on a design document that will connect this flow to the CTO file components to help facilitate the build of a simplified CTO file and connection to the javascript back end that facilitates the movement of the asset through the flow. We'll plan to use our next #patient-member-subgroup meeting on 10/26 to review the design doc. Mikhail and Angela, please let me know if I missed anything.

Thanks, Marissa, for summarizing this morning's discussion. 

Our objective is to have a fairly complete set of design artifacts ready for review on next Friday's SWG call, including one or more high-level architectural views. We should be ready with an initial draft of artifacts by next Wednesday (24-OCT).

We also decided to narrow the scope of the POC to the first two user stories : Donate milk and Receive milk

This should enable us to iterate on and stabilize the core models and APIs in the coming few weeks, including expected work on various necessary network initialization and administration components.

We also decided that Angela and I will take the lead on network development tasks (server-side/back-end components), while Anton and his team will focus on end-user web and mobile app (client-side/front-end) development tasks.

At this stage, it is unclear whether there is any value to be gained from using Composer, or whether we should work directly with the Fabric SDK. Also, should we plan on implementing the network chaincode using Node.js, Go or Java? Go may be the better long-term choice.

Regardless, we are planning to start posting design documentation on the wiki shortly, as well as building out the JIRA board with stories and tasks.

The other near-term decision we need to make relates to choice of agile methodology. We may be leaning toward starting off with Kanban, but need input or feedback from interested parties. 

Have we made a specific commitment to deliver the PoC with a defined set of features by a specific date for an identified event or audience?

Also, this would be a good time to consider certain implementation options regarding choice of blockchain platform components. For example, would it make more sense to consider some type of hybrid Fabric + Indy platform implementation due to the particular importance of identity management and privacy by design in healthcare? 

The PoC could be a great opportunity to help drive requirements for further development of the Indy project, which seems to still be in incubation. Given the modular design of the Fabric MSPs and identity and context services, is there a potential integration that better supports requirements of distributed, multi-stakeholder healthcare delivery and related services systems involving hybrid public- and private-sector consortia? 

As custodians of protected health information and a vast array of biometrics, detailed familial and inter-personal relationship information, and as principal participants in key life events such as birth and death, do healthcare providers potentially stand to play an increasingly important role going forward in an increasingly digitalized society that is increasingly vulnerable to cyber-insecurity and all its various costs to society?
This would be an opportunity to consider policy models that balance the need for privacy, confidentiality, etc., against the need to enforce a complex set of regulatory policies while conducting effective, real-time public health surveillance and case reporting/tracking.
Now that we're embarking on the initial technical design phases for the PoC, this may be a good opportunity to consider decentralized identity management more concretely. We have a reasonable good starting domain model of actors, roles and relationships relating to perinatal and human milk services - narrowly scoped but sufficiently nuanced to cover a range of identity-related use cases.

I wanted to let the members of the Healthcare Working Group know that we have a speaking opportunity at the Distributed Health event in November.  The thinking is to have a panel or fire side chat format where we can discuss the work the group members are doing with Hyperledger in healthcare.

If you will be going to the event and are interested in taking part in this, please let me know.  So far, we have one person from the donor milk use case interested in speaking, but the format is flexible and we can include others in this discussion too.

An interesting summary from the 2nd UN World Data Summit : 
http://enb.iisd.org/undata/worlddataforum/2018/html/enbplus232num2e.html

Its great to see the increased focus on migration statistics, interoperability, statistical-geospatial integration and national statistical systems, along with increased attempts to improve the technical illiteracy of international organizations. Its unfortunate that over-hyped technologies that largely undermine sustainable development such as AI continue to hijack such proceedings. 

Strengthening statistical capacity, including data-driven planning and governance capacity for development program portfolios, is arguably the most critical priority -- and existential challenge -- for the tech industry today -- at least outside the Silicon Valley bubble. Blockchain platforms have the potential to provide a resilient, secure and trusted infrastructure to support such capacity-building activities, with potentially transformative impacts in terms of supporting compliance and combating fraud and abuse. The challenge will be getting the security and privacy design right -- and ensuring the technology contributes to building and safeguarding public trust.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/healthcare-wg?msg=FZRJRWbvA4cEp33HE) @richbl Thanks, Rich. I will be on PTO tomorrow, so will not be dialing in. The patient-member subgroup continues to work with the donor milk use case. Michael Johnson and I conducted an interview with a dietitian responsible for all NICU feeding (including donor milk) for a major hospital. Notes can be found here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/healthcare/donor_milk_transparency_and_traceability#section_6_-_interview_results Other than supply limitations and seeing value of knowing caloric denisty of milk, no problem spaces emerged. I think we need to try and do similar interviews and collect more data. I talked to Ben and he is willing to talk through a revision of the CTO file, but we want to ensure that any simplification of the file doesn't limit real world applicability. Ben also mentioned trying to find some organizations that would be willing to pilot this with us, if anyone is interested in working to build those relationships. I have reached out to Anton, but no word yet and no word from HMBANA this week either. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!

Good Afternoon All,

From this morning's HLHCWG General Meeting, we had an interesting agenda item that I felt might be best exposed to our general membership, as it's a broad topic with many interesting nuances, interpretations, and implications.

About a month ago in a discussion with our HLHCWG Ad Hoc Academic Research Team (Adrian Berg and Mikhail Elias), the topic surfaced of how we might consider integrating HIPAA compliance into a Hyperledger framework solution to better align with the needs in the healthcare domain. That topic has resonated with me ever since, as it's something that I might imagine might make acceptance of a Hyperledger framework solution easier to enterprise healthcare systems (and certainly startups with a keen interest to meet a need), given the use case. But, of course, I could be entirely wrong on this point. So...
Do you see value in developing a HIPAA compliant solution using a Hyperledger framework?
How do you define a HIPAA compliant solution? Can a compliant solution be viewed subjectively, where one end user might claim HIPAA compliance, where another might not? Or, is a HIPAA compliant solution an objective statement of functionality, by definition?
Architecturally, how might an implementation of a HIPAA compliant Hyperledger solution look?
Would you view a solution to be part of Hyperledger.org (a component of one of our frameworks), or apart from Hyperledger.org (perhaps a published API, or third-party add-on, proprietary or otherwise)?
Finally, do you see value in our team, the HLHCWG, pursuing a deeper discussion of this topic, perhaps dedicating an hour of our regular HLHCWG General Meeting to an open discussion?
For context (particularly outside of the US), HIPAA is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. A great resource for understanding HIPAA is available right from the source here. Fair warning: these documents are not particularly joyful reading.

As always, it's great to engage with this community, and drive some very well thought-out discussions.

NOTE that this has been cross-posted on our HLHCWG listserv as well.

Hi All! I'm Tuomas Järvensivu and I'm the CTO of a Finnish company Vaana. We are a software company providing the leading service voucher product in Finnish market. Service voucher is a monetary instrument with which public agencies (such as municipalities in Finland) can outsource their social and health-care services to private sector and provide citizens with more freedom of choice when it comes to their treatment and service selection. Our current SaaS - product handles the service voucher business of about 70 municipalities in Finland. We are currently actively looking into implementing service vouchers and other social- and health care financial transaction models on top of a blockchain / DLT.

Good Morning HLHCWG Team,

A reminder that we'll be hearing from Alex Zhovnuvaty, CTO of RideChain, and the creator of Sawtooth Healthcare, a blockchain application built on Hyperledger Sawtooth, allowing clinics to keep history regarding patients health and claims on the blockchain. Alex would like to donate his Sawtooth Healthcare project to Hyperledger Labs, but in order to do, he first needs a Hyperledger sponsor. Alex's presentation tomorrow will help to gauge HLHCWG membership interests in and feedback for his Hyperledger Sawtooth solution.

The proposed agenda has been published for our next HLHCWG General Meeting slated for tomorrow, Friday (11/16).

Two important recent publications focusing on health and climate change : 

From the Lancet Commission, the Countdown series of review publications : 
https://www.thelancet.com/climate-and-health

The key point is that climate change threatens to undermine 50 years of gains in public health, and there is an urgent need for investing in climate-resilient health systems.  

From the WHO, a Special Report prepared for this year's COP-24 on climate change and health : 
https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/05-12-2018-health-benefits-far-outweigh-the-costs-of-meeting-climate-change-goals

The report emphasizes the welfare costs of direct and indirect impacts of climate change, and stresses the significant benefit-to-cost ratio of intervention -- essentially, that health benefits in economic terms are significantly greater than mitigation costs. 

For health systems, anticipating and responding to climate-related threats is significantly complicated by several concurrent challenges : slowing global economic growth and erosion of available sources of healthcare financing, aging societies and growing burden of dependency, increasing rates of NCDs and escalating related treatment costs, growing risks from spread of antimicrobial resistance, etc. 

Climate change will create stress on health systems from the increased incidence of acute natural disasters - intensified storms and floods, which threaten to disrupt operational services delivery, and adversely impact population health in the aftermath. The risk of drought, depleted groundwater reserves and water shortages are likely to have wide-ranging impacts, with food insecurity and famine being the most serious.  

These challenges provide an important set of requirements to drive planning of regional health IT infrastructure networks. Key questions include : what does systemic resiliency mean, what are the dimensions of health system resiliency, how does this get translated into standards, and what are the quantitative metrics for evaluating performance? 

Our SIG is well-positioned to tackle these questions and offer guidance to health system planners, and I would propose we make this a key workstream going into 2019.

One other related publication - albeit now a few years old, but more relevant than ever : 
https://www.nap.edu/catalog/14682/climate-and-social-stress-implications-for-security-analysis

Public health institutions are likely to play an increasingly central role in security, and health IT infrastructure networks are becoming increasingly critical parts of security services focused on surveillance and situational awareness. This has important implications in areas such as identity and privacy, as well as the security controls and quality of service requirements placed on IT infrastructure networks.

One other related publication - albeit now a few years old, but more relevant than ever : 
https://www.nap.edu/catalog/14682/climate-and-social-stress-implications-for-security-analysis

The key point made is that climate change is likely to increase levels of social stress while weakening societal and institutional coping mechanisms. When these crises exceed the capacity of affected communities to handle, spillovers and cascading shocks are likely to result -- for example, resulting in unplanned migration and refugee crises. Social stress can have an especially corrosive effect on the fabric of institutional trust within communities, which creates serious dysfunction and incapacity to respond during crises.

The good news is there seems to be plenty of funding for security-related infrastructure investment, and a strong business case likely exists for implementing blockchain into the foundational infrastructure platforms of regional health systems - assuming we can build a sufficiently strong evidence base to support claims regarding fault-tolerance, error recovery,  availability, integrity, etc.

Hello everyone, I am Venu. I live in India and been in IT for 16 years, with a healthcare IT background. I am working on hyperledger fabric for about an year now. I would like to discuss with the group about using FHIR on blockchain, and if it seen as the go to standard ?

Benjamin Djidi will be leading this meeting in my absence on Friday. Given the lack of engagement and subject matter expertise on the donor milk project, we would like to use this opportunity to have an honest discussion about whether we should move the project forward. If you have an opinion on the matter, please let us know via email, Rocket.Chat or join the call. The only other topic will be on 2019 planning and direction of the subgroup. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts there as well. Let me know if you have any questions.

 An interesting story in today's news : 
https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/21/faecal-transplant-researchers-identify-super-pooper-donors

The human microbiome has been an important research subject in recent years, with a growing number of therapeutic modalities being identified. Faecal tranplants have been a major breakthrough, with success in treating a growing list of conditions. This research paper suggests further work is needed to improve matching between donor and recipient - which could involve not only clinical and laboratory screening, but relying on accurate health and nutrition profiles. 

Its therefore worth considering the extent to which a market for human faecal donation could be developed - along the lines for milk donation. The high-level business processes are essentially the same, with a supply-side and demand-side. Its possible a faecal banking system may emerge to broker the network. 

It may be worth exploring opportunities to partner with research organizations to develop this concept further, and possible establishing some type of blockchain-based clinical research trials framework to accelerate innovation. We do presently have gastroenterology and clinical informatics expertise as part of our SIG membership. 

Concretely, in the near term, it may be worth considering either redirecting or extending our focus from human milk to emerging faecal donation networks -- or even aiming to develop a general-purposes human tissue and organ donation engine.

It's that time of year when we need to start planning for the 2019 season, and we're looking for your insight on direction.

While 2018 has been a very formative and productive year within Hyperledger and our own HC-SIG, we're hoping to make 2019 a much more broadly engaging and educational year for everyone. With an international membership of over 1000 healthcare professionals interested in identifying and using blockchain technologies in general, and the Hyperledger greenhouse of frameworks and tools in specific, I'm convinced we have yet to tap the true potential of what we can do collectively to shape our global healthcare community.

To make full use of such great potential, we need your insight and guidance. 

*Please take some time now to participate in our 2019 HC-SIG Membership Survey*, located here: https://tinyurl.com/201901-HCSIG-survey

Note: this is a Google Forms survey. If you are unable to access this survey, please contact me directly and I'll send along the survey as a separate document.

It's a reasonably short survey, and your input will set the direction for our 2019 membership year, so please consider this as critical to the ongoing growth and success of the HC-SIG.

The survey will remain open for one month, until 2019.02.17.

Thanks again for a very successful 2018, and here's to a great 2019!

Good evening and welcome to the HLHC-SIG Channel! It's great to have you join our team, and looking forward to having you join us in future discussions. Please tell us a bit about your professional interests in blockchain technologies, and how you learned about this SIG. 

Of course, feel free to use this forum (as well as our listserv and regular HC-SIG and Subgroup meetings) to make professional connections and learn more about the industry.

Again, welcome!

Hi @richbl thanks. Just a bit about me, my background is mostly technology architecture (solutions, integration, enterprise) and development. I've been involved in a few PoC and pilot Ethereum projects. I have worked as a consultant/contractor for several healthcare companies and I'm looking to pair both my healthcare and blockchain knowledge while gaining additional knowledge and contributing to projects. I learned of the sig from browsing around the Hyperledger wiki.

Hi all, just dropping a line to introduce myself.  I'm Laura Crady, an Information Security Advisor on the Data Protection team within Integrated Global Security & Resilience Data at Aetna, a CVS Health company.  Whew, that was a mouthful!  I am interested in learning more about blockchain and discovering innovative ways to leverage it in the healthcare industry.  I am in the process of joining our enterprise blockchain working group and am hoping this group will supplement my personal and professional interests in blockchain.  I live in Tampa, Florida and I recently joined BlockSpaces, a local blockchain technology education and development center.  See https://blockspaces.io/.  Looking forward to learning from and collaborating with you all.

Hi Rich, I joined the meeting today (or a meeting at 700 PT) although late as I was in between two other ones. But I don't see the meeting notes for the meeting I attended, the link above links to a recording of a meeting I did not attend. I am surprised. In the meeting I attended we talked extensively and wrote a summary of the difference between Fabric and Sawtooth with regards to segmentation (Sawtooth) and channels (Fabric). Where do I find that content and the meeting recording?

@pbuendia 
I'm not sure what the meeting was that you attended. Here's a link to our Hyperledger Community Calendar: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Calendar+of+Public+Meetings. Offhand, I don't see any other meeting scheduled for 0700 Pacific (the same time as the HC-SIG General Meeting). It's possible that there some a separate team meeting happening at that time, but unless it's on the calendar, I'm not sure if there's an easy way to track that down. You could check over on the #fabric or #sawtooth channels to see if they've had any recent meetings that conform to your description.

Good Day HC-SIG Team,

I wanted to share with you two new opportunities to participate in healthcare-related challenges that were introduced in this morning's *HC-SIG General Meeting*.

As presented, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation is due to release later this month two new innovation challenges, both of which encompass the healthcare industry:

- New Healthcare Challenge Opportunities
  - Sponsored through the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation
    - Social Determinants of Healthcare (SDoH) Innovation Challenge
      - Opens 2019.04.29
      - Phase I deadline: 2019.06.07
    - Home & Community Based Care Innovation Challenge
      - Opens: 2019.04.29
      - Phase I deadline: 2019.06.07

I want to bring these two opportunities to your attention in the event that you might imagine challenge solutions that might happen to include blockchain technologies. Recall that HC-SIG membership numbers over 1000 members globally, and it's very likely that your idea to participate in one or both of these challenges might also be shared by a number of other HC-SIG members.

Some considerations as you think through your challenge solutions: 

- Note the time frame: about one month for a Phase I submission
- Read very carefully the terms/conditions of these challenges. Most open challenges/competitions are very particular about entrant/team qualifications
- While the Linux Foundation/Hyperledger cannot promote/submit teams on its behalf, it is possible to form teams and discuss ideas through the forums of this organization

Absolutely feel free to use the HC-SIG listserv as a means for discussion. As well, you may want to use this HC-SIG Rocket.Chat channel for furthering discussions with potential teammates.

Hello everyone, I am Erika Beerbower. Thank you to Wendy Charles for introducing me to the group. I am a clinical pharmacist with a background in hospital pharmacy currently working for IBM Watson Health. I analyze literature for several drug information databases, work with the informatics team, assist with evaluating the adoption of cognitive learning in healthcare with Watson, and occasionally as an SME on blockchain in healthcase use cases. My interest stems from being a cryptocurrency investor several years ago, and then digging deeper into blockchain in healthcare with IBM. My work has mostly been in supply chain (however I am fascinated by all of the current and future use cases), and I am interested in connecting clinicians with this technology in terms of education, adoption and governance. 
</p>
<p><strong>richbl</strong> (Fri, 03 May 2019 16:30:08 GMT):<br/>
@beerbowe 
Good morning Erika and great to have you join HC-SIG!

Of course, my first thought is, "wow you get to play with IBM Watson Health!" Pretty amazing, and I'm sure, particularly as it relates to blockchain technologies, it'd be great to perhaps have you speak more on this very interesting field of work that you're doing at some point in the future.

Again, welcome!

@santhonydo 
Good Morning, and welcome to the HC-SIG. Thanks very much for joining us. As you might already know, our wiki (https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HCSIG/HC-SIG+-+General) should provide you with a bit of background on this great organization, and of course, it'd be great to have you join us on bi-monthly HC-SIG General Meeting. As well, we have three subgroups focussed on various projects, and several ad hoc teams in which you might want to become more involved.

Can you tell me: what part of the country are you from (helps me to understand time zone concerns for future meetings)?

Thanks again, and welcome!

Rich

Good Afternoon Bob,

Thanks for the resources. As well, I wanted to share with you a really useful resource that relates to healthcare interoperability (seems that this area goes hand-in-hand with blockchain technologies architecture discussions) from ONC/HIT, the 2019 Interoperability Standards Advisory: https://www.healthit.gov/isa/

As well, here's a great reference sponsored through the ONC/HIT U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI), PDF only (https://www.healthit.gov/isa/sites/isa/files/inline-files/USCDIv12019revised2.pdf), which serves as a lookup for various health data elements crossed with the current healthcare standard(s) (e.g., LOINC, SNOMed).

Finally, here's a useful report that defines some of the existing pain points in the helathcare system, the 2017 (most recent) CAQH Core Index Report, here as PDF (https://www.caqh.org/sites/default/files/explorations/index/report/2017-caqh-index-report.pdf).

Bob, regarding this last organization, are you familiar with CAQH? I'm trying to understand what organizations would be better served by CAQH than ONC or related?

Thanks again for the information. Very useful!

Rich

Rich, many thanks for the useful links.
CAQH is a “non-profit alliance of health plans and trade associations, developing and leading initiatives that positively impact the business of healthcare.” The Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare is “essentially an online database that stores provider information. Providers grant access to their information to insurance companies. This makes acquiring provider information more efficient. Instead of calling your office for your work history or a copy of your medical license, insurance companies can go in and pull it directly from your file. 90% of the National Health Insurance Companies use CAQH and it is a prerequisite for their enrollment process.” (http://www.practicons.com/medical-credentialing/what-is-caqh/) 
Based on their website information, it seems that CAQH CORE (https://www.caqh.org/core/caqh-core) and HL7 have recently announced a collaboration to “Improve Interoperability Between Administrative and Clinical Systems.” This is a “collaboration to address long-standing healthcare industry challenges by accelerating automation and improving interoperability between administrative and clinical systems.”  
In summary, the CAQH’s mission statement seems to be based on improving the centralized database realization of semantic interoperability within and between administrative and clinical IT systems.
I believe that minimizing the cost and maximizing the quality of the financing and delivery of inpatient and outpatient healthcare products and services by providers will ultimately depend on creating functional, structural and semantic interoperability for the efficient viewing, downloading and transmitting (sharing/exchanging) of the complex clinical transactions that occur between physicians and patients.
Regrettably, as long as the hospitals and health IT system vendors continue to control their dominant  provider-centric (EHR) interoperability environment (where patients assume that wherever they go for care, their provider will have access to their entire healthcare history).the development of the semantic level of interoperability will remain beyond the reach of physicians and patients in their theoretical, patient-centric (PHR) interoperability environment (where patients could actually take shared ownership and operational control of their cumulative lifetime PHI as a "single source of truth").
It would be interesting to poll the HLHC-SIG, ONC and CAQH memberships to determine how many are clinicians and patients. I doubt there are any significant number of either stakeholder group.
CAQH CORE: Operating Rules Streamline the Business of Healthcare
Mission
Drive the creation and adoption of healthcare operating rules that support standards, accelerate interoperability, and align administrative and clinical activities among providers, payers and consumers.
Vision
An industry-wide facilitator of a trusted, simple and sustainable healthcare data exchange that evolves and aligns with market needs.

@BobColiMD, here's the link to our most recent HC-SIG survey (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1pUi5vBqdh-qzz7OM__md9isU1F7Aj7dz6-8hsl_hmU0/edit#responses). Note that we don't ask the question specifically about provider/patient mix. As we're due to send out the survey for 2020 soon, perhaps it's time to start thinking about survey questions and edits to this survey format. Now you have me thinking about this... :)

“Healthcare is on the cusp of a technology revolution. Technology is primed to disrupt healthcare more explosively than it has any other industry.”
Medical advancements certainly impact clinical laboratories and anatomic pathology groups, and any acceleration in these developing technologies applied to healthcare will certainly be of interest to lab leaders who want to ensure their labs are ready. 
Blockchain Provides Healthcare Security, Privacy, and Interoperability
Authored by Sloan Gaon, CEO, PulsePoint, the FierceHealthcare article predicts that blockchain will be an important feature in the future of healthcare. It will allow patients to have an online, accurate health record that is accessible only to necessary parties in real time. Consumers will be able to maintain, control, and share their data as they wish while increasing the security, privacy, and interoperability of their health information. 
“A primary care physician could access a complete medical history of the member, while the radiologist could be limited to only the specifics he or she needs to perform the task at hand. For each, it’s about accessing the right data at the right time, and the blockchain technology could enable this type of specific ‘need-to-know’ medical history access,” wrote Bruce Broussard, President and CEO of Humana in a LinkedIn article. 
The blockchain records can be shared among a network of computers and kept secure via cryptography. And the technology allows for easy transferability among different networks, improving performance and outcomes for patients. Broussard also stated that blockchain technology will provide more efficient payment for insurance claims. 
“With transparency and automation, greater efficiencies will lead to lower administration costs, faster claims, and less money wasted. Blockchain enables claims to be paid without an intermediary, since health plan members are connecting directly with their providers. These consumers can also access their permanent electronic health records in a secure fashion, enabling them to have a real-time understanding of their health,” he wrote. 
Should blockchain achieve widespread adoption as a platform for patient health information, the clinical laboratory industry will need to address the problem of different test methodologies and different reference ranges for test results. If blockchain makes it feasible to bring all pieces of a single patient’s cumulative health data into a single record, then clinical labs will need to address that problem in an effective way.

Are Recent Predictions Regarding the Future of Healthcare Positive or Negative for Clinical Laboratories
Medical laboratories that develop appropriate clinical strategies may find opportunities to leverage several new technologies expected to have a big impact on providers
Industry experts often speculate how developing technologies will impact healthcare. However, clinical laboratory leaders may be surprised by how much: 
•	blockchain, 
•	medical malls, and 
•	Uber Health are expected to alter healthcare delivery in the next decade.

@BobColiMD, good afternoon Bob. Thanks for passing this along, as the quotes you posted here are indeed encouraging and in line with our broader hopes that blockchain technologies will indeed facilitate healthcare operations, particularly in favor of the patient (and to drive that even more directly, for patients who are served across multiple hospital systems and/or at longer time intervals, such as chronic disease patients or patients managing longer-term acute care conditions such as cancer).

I wonder if you might share the link to the originating article(s)?

Good afternoon Rich,
As you know, in a January 2019 interview with Jim Kramer, Tim Cook claimed that Apple's greatest contribution to mankind will be in the healthcare industry. It would be interesting to invite the right person from Apple to a HLHC-SIG virtual meeting in Q1 2020 to describe their progress toward this lofty goal and determine if and how blockchain technologies fit into their efforts.

Good Morning All,

For those of us active in the healthcare industry, the annual HIMSS Conference is a great opportunity to learn about the latest in health IT trends and, often, to get a glimpse into the future of healthcare technologies. Importantly, HIMSS attendees' collective understanding, viewpoints, insights, and concerns on the integration and use of blockchain technologies greatly help to drive the direction of this organization, and of course, the HC-SIG.

As you might know, the HIMSS Conference (https://www.himssconference.org/)  is happening March 9-13, 2020 in Orlando, Florida. While we're a couple of months away, I'd like to ask if anyone from the HC-SIG is planning to attend the conference, and if so, for what dates during the conference.

As we did at last year's HIMSS Conference, we're hoping to put together a special event for HC-SIG members to meet and socialize.

Please let me know if you'd be interested in participating, and we can coordinate dates/times.

Hope to see you there!

Rich

It's that time of year when we start developing our 2020 season, and we're looking for your insight on direction.

While 2019 has been a very productive year within Hyperledger and our own HC-SIG, we're hoping to make 2020 a more engaging and educational year for everyone. With a very large and diverse international membership ofhealthcare professionals interested in identifying and using blockchain technologies in general, and the Hyperledger greenhouse of frameworks and tools in specific, I believe we have yet to tap the true potential of what we can do collectively to shape our global healthcare community.

*To make full use of such great potential, we need your insight and guidance. Please take some time now to participate in our 2020 HC-SIG Membership Survey, located here: https://forms.gle/LVTAbrm2aadomwS19
*
Note that this is a Google Forms survey. If you are unable to access this survey, please contact me directly and I'll send along the survey as a separate document.

Your input will set the direction for our 2020 membership year, so please consider this as critical to the ongoing growth and success of the HC-SIG.

*The survey will remain open until 2020.02.14.*

Thanks again for a very successful 2019, and here's to a great 2020!

@Tomomi.Yamano 
Good Evening, and welcome to the HC-SIG. Thanks very much for joining us. As you might already know, our wiki (https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HCSIG/HC-SIG+-+General) should provide you with a bit of background on this great organization, and of course, it'd be great to have you join us on bi-monthly HC-SIG General Meeting. As well, we have three subgroups focused on various projects, and several ad hoc teams in which you might want to become more involved.

Can you please let everyone know what you do, where you're from, and what your interests in healthcare are?

Finally, to answer your question, this is the one channel used by the HC-SIG group. However, feel free to kick off some interesting discussions here, and it'd be great to get some good ideas flowing.

Thanks again, and welcome!

Rich

Can you please let everyone know what you do, where you're from, and what your interests in healthcare are?

And, for the Membership Directory, my recommendation would be to use a LInkedIn, Facebook our similar account, as email addresses posted on a public site can pose a risk.

Thanks and looking forward to learning more about you and your team.

A quick note that, in the US, Homeland Security recently issued something called the "MEMORANDUM ON IDENTIFICATION OF ESSENTIAL CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WORKERS DURING COVID-19 RESPONSE" (link here: https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA-Guidance-on-Essential-Critical-Infrastructure-Workers-1-20-508c.pdf) which calls out blockchain technologies as a COVID-19 critical service in the context of: 

"Employees and firms supporting food, feed, and beverage distribution, including warehouse workers, vendor-managed inventory controllers and blockchain managers"

Good Day HC-SIG Team,

Announcing our second in a series of *HC-SIG Special Topic Meetings: Conquering the COVID-19 Virus Pandemic*.

As our most recent *HC-SIG Special Topic Meeting* was very well received, and given too that the COVID-19 virus continues to impact us at an accelerating global level, our next HC-SIG meeting will again follow in the format as we did at our last meeting, as an *HC-SIG Special Topic Meeting*.

With the COVID-19 virus continuing to accelerate its devastating impact on communities at a global level, I'm asking the entirety of our HC-SIG membership to again join us at Friday's HC-SIG Special Topic Meeting to discuss your ideas about how to offset the many problems generated by this global pandemic. We're dedicating the full hour to an open and frank discussion on where innovative blockchain technologies--including DLTs, SSI, and cryptocurrencies/tokens--solutions might help to:

- Slow the progression of this deadly virus
- Manage life-saving logistics networks and medical supply chains with improved throughputs and efficiencies
- Serve as a means for more timely and more accurate healthcare communications model across communities, states, provinces, and countries

All of this, scheduled for this Friday at 0700 Pacific.

Good Day HC-SIG Team,

Reminder: our third in an ongoing series of *HC-SIG Special Topic Meetings: Conquering the COVID-19 Virus Pandemic,* is happening tomorrow, Friday, at 0700 Pacific.

As our most recent HC-SIG Special Topic Meeting was very well received, and given too that the COVID-19 virus continues to impact us at a global level, our next HC-SIG meeting will again follow in the format as we did at our last meeting, as an HC-SIG Special Topic Meeting.

With the COVID-19 virus continuing to accelerate its devastating impact on communities at a global level, I'm asking the entirety of our HC-SIG membership to again join us at Friday's HC-SIG Special Topic Meeting to discuss your ideas about how to offset the many problems generated by this global pandemic. We're dedicating the full hour to an open and frank discussion on where innovative blockchain technologies--including DLTs, SSI, and cryptocurrencies/tokens--solutions might help to:

- Slow the progression of this deadly virus
- Manage life-saving logistics networks and medical supply chains with improved throughputs and efficiencies
- Serve as a means for more timely and more accurate healthcare communications model across communities, states, provinces, and countries

All of this, scheduled for tomorrow, Friday, at 0700 Pacific.

We're featuring a number of special guest speakers to provide you with their views and ideas on how to manage the COVID-19 virus through technology, including:

- Mark Treshock, Global Blockchain Solutions Leader for Healthcare and Life Sciences at IBM
Mark will present on some of recent initiatives that IBM has been driving as it relates to the COVID-19 virus pandemic. 

- Heather Flannery, Founder and CEO of ConsenSys Health
Heather will present information related to their recently-launched STOP COVID-19 Ethereum Hackathon, running now through MAY 11. Our own Brian Behlendorf, Executive Director for the Hyperledger Project, will be serving as one of the judges for this event.

- Anesu Machoko, CEO & Co-Founder of MetaDigitaI
A description of the work that Anesu and his team are doing with self-sovereign identity (SSI) in the healthcare industry, and how their solutions might be used to help manage secure exchanges between patient, provider, and pharmacy during and after this COVID-19 virus pandemic
Anesu and his team will be presenting more formally at an upcoming HC-SIG General Meeting, and we thank him for offering to help drive today's very timely and important discussion around the COVID-19 virus pandemic

Please consider joining your fellow HC-SIG members on this important call to help drive successful solutions in conquering COVID-19 through the use of blockchain technologies.

Hello friends, this is the 1.0 version of a Sawtooth health care blockchain, based on the wonderful work of @AlexanderZhovnuvaty , I intend to use it to provide for my country DR a healthcare blockchain to track the information of all the patients and the serial diseases that happen every year, mainly to help on those poor communities on the country.
Also I would like to put this project on Hyperledger labs, I just need an sponsor
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Thu, 04 Jun 2020 19:55:02 GMT):<br/>
@richbl can you be my sponsor please?
</p>
<p><strong>richbl</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 02:33:40 GMT):<br/>
@hidura 
Great to know that work has been progressing on @AlexanderZhovnuvaty 's Sawtooth healthcare solution. As Alex's solution is already part of Hyperledger Labs (https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/sawtooth-healthcare), can you please tell me a little more about the differences of your solution from his? 

As well, please review the Hyperledger Labs wiki page (https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/labs/Hyperledger+Labs+Home) for details and guidance in the application to include your project in Hyperledger Labs. Finally, I'm including @VipinB on this thread, as SIG chairs are no longer permitted to serve as project sponsors. 

Best of luck, and please let me know how I can help your project succeed!
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 14:56:10 GMT):<br/>
Hello, thanks for the answer, my solution I've create an entity called party, which could be a doctor or a patient, every time one of the entities want to see the record of another, have to be granted the consent, in this part I added the time, so the access have limited time, and the evaluation is molded to be connected with the gnuhealth system
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 14:57:09 GMT):<br/>
Thanks again for the opportunity
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 16:13:10 GMT):<br/>
Also is the webmod, that any user with the credentials to logged in and see the evaluations and grant access to somebody
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 20:13:36 GMT):<br/>
Can this be not added to https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/sawtooth-healthcare @AlexanderZhovnuvaty  should be able to guide you to add this in as an (optional) extension.
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 20:16:30 GMT):<br/>
Ok
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 20:17:22 GMT):<br/>
Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 20:19:29 GMT):<br/>
Or am I missing some important technical roadblock?
</p>
<p><strong>hidura</strong> (Fri, 05 Jun 2020 20:22:28 GMT):<br/>
Well there's a difference between the code of @AlexanderZhovnuvaty and mine, because I generate n number of people, and I use a different way to make the consent.

Hello,

Besides LedgerDomain, what HyperLedger supply chain solutions are there for medical devices and supplies? 

I see the following reiterated "Manage life-saving logistics networks and medical supply chains with improved throughputs and efficiencies". 

IBM Sterling/Trust Your Supplier's Rapid Supplier Connect only had one supplier who offered the medical supplies we need. 
Whereas Change HealthCare processed over a trillion dollars of transactions in 2017/18 - albeit that's only between payers and providers. 

Is there anything else out there?

Thanks,
</p>

Good Evening and welcome to the HC-SIG. Thanks very much for joining us. As you might already know, our wiki (https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HCSIG/HC-SIG+-+General) should provide you with a bit of background on this organization, and of course, it'd be great to have you join us on our semi-monthly HC-SIG General Meeting. As well, we have three subgroups focused on various projects, and several ad hoc teams in which you might want to become more involved.

Great to have you join this group, and looking forward to learning more about what you do, and your interests in using blockchain technologies in healthcare.

If you have any other questions, feel free to ask them here, or check out our FAQ, located here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HCSIG/HC-SIG+FAQ

Thanks again, and welcome!

@RDLGBC 
Good Evening Michael. Great question. First off, welcome and thanks for joining the HC-SIG channel. As you might already know, our wiki (https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HCSIG/HC-SIG+-+General) should provide you with a bit of background on this organization, and of course, it'd be great to have you join us on our semi-monthly HC-SIG General Meeting. 

Offhand, I know that Spiritus Partners is using a DLT solution for their medical device management solutions (see details and CEO Susan Ramanat's presentation to HC-SIG membership here: https://www.hyperledger.org/learn/webinars/improving-medical-device-safety-quality-and-compliance). As well, Priya Gopal at Gilead Sciences presented earlier this year on the topic of using blockchain technologies (DLTs) in pharma supply chains. Her presentation is here: https://www.hyperledger.org/learn/webinars/blockchain-in-the-pharmaceutical-industry. 

As well, you might want to review some of the blockchain article citations maintained by one of our HC-SIG members. That document is searchable here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HCSIG/Blockchain+Article+Citations.

To your specific question, this would great to post to our HC-SIG membership (please see the FAQ that details how to do this), which is a global membership of ~1000 professionals in the healthcare and technology space, all with the interest in solving problems using blockchain technologies. I suspect your ask will drive a number of responses from healthcare vendors and organizations that would be interested in sharing their supply chain solutions.

Thanks the posing the question, and looking forward to having you join the community.

Hi everyone, my name is Pablo Bullian [pablo.bullian@gmail.com].
I'm the CISO at medicalwebexperts.com, a company that develops apps and portals for the healthcare industry in the US.
I'm currently doing a master's on information security and I wanted to write my final project on using hyperledger to keep track of patients clinical history and at the same time keep it secure by using 3XDH to share secrets on the transaction. I guess that some implementations of the sort were already tested and I would appreciate it if someone can share some links if you have any.

I was also reading through the notes of the past meetings, and I think that it's a really interesting project the one that you are trying out right now.

Thanks,
</p>

@pbullian 
Good morning, and welcome to the HC-SIG. Thanks very much for joining us. As you might already know, our wiki (https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HCSIG/HC-SIG+-+General) should provide you with a bit of background on this great organization, and of course, it'd be great to have you join us on our bi-monthly HC-SIG General Meeting. As well, we have three subgroups focused on various projects, and several ad hoc teams in which you might want to become more involved. Great to have you join this group, and looking forward to having you share your expertise with HC-SIG membership.

If you have any other questions, feel free to ask them here, or check out our FAQ, located here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HCSIG/HC-SIG+FAQ

Thanks again, and welcome!

@here 
Good Day HC-SIG Team,

I'm very happy to announce that we have a winner in our election for Hyperledger HC-SIG Chair, reviewed and approved by Hyperledger leadership.

*Congratulations and welcome to Mike McCoy!*

Mike will do a great job in carrying forward much of the momentum and enthusiasm that's made this global HC-SIG membership such a great organization.

I'll be working with Mike over the next week as we transition leadership.

Please take a moment and congratulate Mike (cc'd in this email).

Thanks to all who participated in this election, and best wishes to Mike going forward!

Hello @mike.mccoy I'm trying to get on your conference call but it's asking for a password.
</p>
<p><strong>mike.mccoy</strong> (Fri, 18 Sep 2020 14:03:50 GMT):<br/>
Hey HC-SIG,

Deepest apologizes for the issue today for our meeting. All of us are running into an issue logging in as a password is being requested.

I, nor Erika have access or have been aware we need a password to log into this zoom meeting. 

For now, we will cancel today's meeting and reschedule for a time most convenient for our group. Again, my deepest apologizes to Tsvetan and all of the people looking to join today.

Regards,
</p>

Hi everyone,

My name is Adrian founder of GST. We are a global tech community in 35+ countries and we have partnered with the Hyperledger community in the past to make connections worldwide.

I just had a chat with David Boswell, and he mentioned you guys are doing webinars for the community and present projects and/or startups relating to Social impact blockchain solutions.

Now, I’m reaching out because we are interested in helping those projects connect with the right partners in multiple new markets for the purpose of scaling up, finding sales, and distribution channels.

We do this through a matching engine by matching real-world organizational problems with solutions. We would love and get more data on those projects here. Check out this post https://medium.com/globalsouthtech/looking-for-teams-startups-and-projects-to-help-them-scale-up-bce9497eadfa

I would love to engage further with this group and explore collaborations if any comments please just let me know

Thanks a lot
Adrian

There are a lot of projects that aren’t getting further than the theoretical and/or proof of concept phase. Is this because they aren’t presenting a valuable enough case or the value is too far out? Is it because it makes more sense to join a network than spend the cost to develop one? Am I wrong and a lot of projects are progressing? Is this normal for most new technologies? I am seeing some correlation with what happened with machine learning. Let me know if you have any thoughts to some of these questions.

<p><strong>mikepica</strong> (Sun, 05 Sep 2021 16:11:27 GMT):<br/>
At the last meeting, we talked about patients being able to monetize their data. A limitation that was mentioned was that legally they are only able to receive $500-$1,000 annually for this. I’m wondering if patients could form a DAO, submit their data, and create a token. The token could appreciate based off the value of the data for compensation. The thought is they aren’t directly selling their data but benefiting from the collective use of it.

<p><strong>qsmen</strong> (Thu, 09 Sep 2021 01:54:39 GMT):<br/>
hi,  ususally there are hospitals, insurance companies and research institutions in a blockchain-based healthy system.  Do they use different functionality of one same dapp or they use different dapps to cooperate?  thank you.
</p>
<p><strong>qsmen</strong> (Thu, 09 Sep 2021 02:06:04 GMT):<br/>
the big difference between the two modes is where the data of each role is.
</p>
<p><strong>mikepica</strong> (Fri, 10 Sep 2021 11:30:46 GMT):<br/>
One thing you may be interested is the project called Melloddy https://www.melloddy.eu/objectives. This is federated learning and the institutions you noted above can keep their own data but still "share" it for machine learning models. Another project you may be interested in is the Synaptic Health Alliance https://www.synaptichealthalliance.com/about-us which is trying to create a chain across the networks for provider demographic data.
