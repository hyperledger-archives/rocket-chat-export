{"msg":"1) What is the FHIRBlocks team's background?\nThe FHIRBlocks Project team is descendent from DCS Health, developer of HoIP, (a leading CDHP platform). I was previously BellSouth’s Chief Strategist, and most to the FHIRBlocks team are network engineers with extensive internet/carrier development backgrounds\n\n2) What is FHIRBlocks’ security/access model?\nFHIRblocks centerpiece (and principle contribution to HyperLedger) is contained in its Supplemental Method of Open Access Control (SMOAC).  And SMOAC itself is best views as an overlay upon OAUTH2/OIDC that effects a higher level of trust; high enough, in fact, to enable open access to FHIR networks by users and applications not registered to traditional EHR/enterprise networks (see also #3 below)\n\n3) How does FHIRBlocks map patient identifiers to specific FHIR Resources?\nAnother key FHIRBlocks component is the notion of a CSI (certified self-sovereign identity). CSI’s (which we believe can comprise and extension of Indy) also serves as a virtual UPI (i.e., via DNS-like translations to FHIR server registries and MPIs); CSI’s also comprise the rough equivalent of a client-side digital certificate\n\n4) How does FHIRBlocks achieve more attractive “cryptoeconomics?\nPerhaps the mist import aspect of SMOAC, CSI and other FHIRBlocks components is it potential to animate new business models—e.g., by enabling application providers building of monetization schemes independent of EHRs\n\n5) What is FHIRBlocks' governance model?  Who participates in the concensus model?\nTBD. In fact, we’re hoping to get input from this working group on key questions of this sort—e.g., what alternatives does Fabric support?","username":"mpiekarska","ts":"2017-09-29T13:12:45.529Z"}

Currently I'm active as a board member (also past chair) of the 3rd largest non-profit kidney care organization in the US called Northwest Kidney Centers (NKC), which is based right here in Seattle.\n\nAs a result, you might imagine that the engineering work we do in healthcare is very personal (what better way to operate a business?) and admittedly self-serving (HA!).","username":"richbl","ts":"2017-09-29T21:31:05.318Z"}

{"msg":"@jonreid, Indeed! However, I'll mention that you're imagining blockchain/DLT solutions as full replacements for existing EHR backends, and while I believe that's possible, there's quite a bit of room for new or supplemental DLT services that work in conjunction with existing EHRs and proprietary IT stacks (architectures). Hoping the colloquialism carries, but we don't want to be throwing the baby out with the bathwater just yet :). I should add that we're based out of Seattle, USA, so the brass ring of a single-payer healthcare system is far out of reach at this moment in time: I believe this to be a cultural/generational issue (hoping that a younger generation sees the need to change our perceptions at  a deeper, social level).\n\nAll told, here in the present, easily the biggest issue we regularly face is not technical at all, but political: finding the right context (and funding) to demonstrate these great new services.","username":"richbl","ts":"2018-01-13T15:39:35.651Z"}

{"msg":"@NateDiNiro, interesting read. Thanks for posting. \n\nTo be honest, I see much of the blockchain hype (heavy emphasis on hype) as a misunderstanding of the technology: it's seen as a panacea for just about any problem in healthcare today! Heady promises abound in a world where healthcare IT tends to move very slowly. That said, I prefer to focus on the underlying technologies that are getting more attention because of the blockchain hype, including distributed ledger technologies proper (not necessarily blockchains in the context of current Hyperledger projects), and distributed identity management (aka, self-sovereign identity management). The latter is of particular interest to me, as it lays up nicely in understanding how patient- and clinical-facing services should be properly architected in healthcare going forward.\n\nThat said, in line with what was identified in the article, I'm also familiar with FHIR, and for the sake of interoperability in today's stove-piped EHR environment, it's much easier (and generally lower cost) to implement than HL7 proper. From a developer's perspective, FHIR as a technology is certainly much more elegant. Of course, interoperability requires vendors to open up, which--in an unregulated space--is very hard to do (I worked at Microsoft many years ago when MS-DOS and then Windows APIs were notoriously not so well documented for a reason).","username":"richbl","ts":"2018-01-19T22:14:22.961Z"}

{"msg":"Hi team, I believe I am new to the chat here.  I have been working both at Optum and a number of blockchain startups (some healthcare related).  I have read some of the above and love the thinking.  I have formed a slightly different opinion on how blockchain works in more privacy-required spaces, like healthcare.  Of course, the tech is changing and so by the time I finish this it could be outdated. :-)\n\nThe first thing to note is why blockchain is valuable - it really does two things.  Reduces the cost of verification (math to establish trust) and reduces the cost of networking (infrastructure, building network effects, \"the economics\").  The first is really easy for people to grasp once they dive into the tech and many teams stop there - the thinking is walled around this concept of sharing data, single source-of-truth through consensus, etc.  This is the pitfall that the healthcare industry ran into when constructing the concept of the HIE - there was little consideration for the economics of the network (data socialism) - and we all know what happened/is happening there.\n\nThe blockchain solutions that really show promise look carefully at how public networks are successful and do not shy away from tokenization.  The token is a protocol in your network that is a tool to incentivize (or punish) participation and enable a data marketplace.  Imagine trying to create a country without a currency - goods and services would need to be bartered between participants, it's a step backward in time and limits innovation.\n\nLayer trust and privacy --> The layering of innovative, permissionless blockchains over more permissioned data storage models (of which I classify any permissioned blockchain, IPFS, SQL database running in your basement, etc.) is the key to success here in healthcare.  It could be... \"Fork of ethereum run as a public network\" + Hyperledger (for healthcare consortium) + SQL databases hosting in secure data centers (for more private/sensitive/IP-related data) = enabling a use case.\n\nIf anyone wants to talk more about this please reach out.

We sold it for ten euros at first, and what happened? Banks and application providers would say, ‘Why should I support this card? Nobody has it.’ It was a dead end.” In what may have been the seminal insight of twenty-first-century Estonia, Martens realized that whoever offered the most ubiquitous and secure platform would run the country’s digital future—and that it should be an elected leadership, not profit-seeking Big Tech. “The only thing was to push this card to the people, without them knowing what to do with it, and then say, ‘Now people have a card. Let’s start some applications,’ ” he said.\n\nThe first “killer application” for the I.D.-card-based system was the one that Martens still works on: i-voting, or casting a secure ballot from your computer. Before the first i-voting period, in 2005, only five thousand people had used their card for anything. More than nine thousand cast an i-vote in that election, however—only two per cent of voters, but proof that online voting was attracting users—and the numbers rose from there. As of 2014, a third of all votes have been cast online.\"","username":"TonyLittle","ts":"2018-02-08T08:23:28.992Z"}

I tend to use this Estonia article as a touchstone when I wonder why I'm tilting windmills as often as I do... because it all _can_ work if done right.\n\nRegarding your comment about data privacy, I agree absolutely that social media is resetting perceptions about sharing. But... my observation is that younger folks (I'm 52) will drive much of the change in healthcare precisely because of the expectations that they've grown up with as it relates to social media: transparency, timeliness, and perhaps most important, engagement (specifically, incentive for long-term, regular engagement... often served through a very active, reinforcing feedback loop).\n\nAnd I also enjoyed reading about how Estonia handed out ID cards to everyone, and THEN approached vendors and said \"look, you have an audience... go build something and engage them.\" My colleagues and I hope to implement something like this out here in Seattle.

{"msg":"Regarding the potential benefits of Hyperledger versus Ethereum, two big differences are scalability and confidentiality.  Because Ethereum is open to all kinds of different transactions, it will be weighed down by transactions supporting hundreds of applications.  Creating a private blockchain with Hyperledger limits activity only to transactions relevant to the application.  Regarding confidentiality, confidentiality on blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin is passive and de facto.  Identities of transacting parties are undecipherable because various transactions mostly look alike.  In Enterprise blockchains, many unique transactions can occur that allow detection of the identify of transaction parties through inference.  For example, if see three large transactions every month for a product like Viagra, we can infer that the seller is Pfizer and that the buyers are the Big 3 distributors through whom 90% of all prescription drugs pass in the US.  Further analysis could allow us to distinguish between the three and also determine the identity of some of their larger customers.  A private Hyperledger solution may build in additional layers of obfuscation to prevent this valuable competitive intelligence from being guessed.","username":"jstollman","ts":"2018-03-09T16:03:05.925Z"}

{"msg":"Regarding the utility of a token, I believe that many blockchain applications will ultimate be served by using a token for access and/or payment.  While Hyperledger intentionally does not foster a \"native\" cryptocurrency token, we believe that such tokens will arise in the market.  In fact, we are developing one ourselves that specifically targets Hypeledger blockchains.  Recognizing that there will be many Hyperledger blockchains with different structures and rules, it is important to first develop chain code that will allow these blockchains to perform payment transactions on our cryptocurrency blockchain, while the other aspects of the transaction remain native to each private blockchain solution.

Please tell us a bit about your interests in blockchain technologies, Hyperledger in particular, and your professional background.\n\nVery good read on identifying some differences between Ethereum and Hyperledger. I agree that there will be many blockchain solutions running in parallel, and many more with very specific requirements and use cases that will define their architectures. I particularly found your interpretation of transaction analytics of blockchains interesting, though that would assume that transactions are always made in an open channel (not necessarily true when using the Fabric framework). \n\nAnd I agree absolutely that tokens will become a fundamental component of most blockchain solutions, as they can be utilized in such a way to drive incentive, which will help drive acceptance. Perhaps your token solution can be the first Hyperledger project that implements a framework agnostic token solution. That would be great!\n\nAgain, welcome!","username":"richbl","ts":"2018-03-09T20:11:35.281Z"}

{"msg":"@Switch2Logic\n\nWelcome to the workgroup, and glad to have you join us. The Hyperledger frameworks are indeed a bit complicated to get into, but there are quite a number of samples out there. For me, the best way to learn is to study these working models and iterate from there.\n\nAs for your specific question, we're developing a healthcare solution using Fabric, and our design does not store health records directly on the ledger. Instead, we're using IPFS (https://ipfs.io/) to hash links to off-chain data, which may include health records, among other related datasets.\n\nInterestingly, this approach is similar, in some respects, to another healthcare company called Coral Health (https://mycoralhealth.com/). Their company CEO, Andy Park, recently presented here in Seattle, and confirmed their use of IPFS in their solution design.\n","username":"richbl","ts":"2018-05-15T01:44:58.106Z"}

{"msg":"@richbl \n\nThank you for the warm welcome. I am very pleased with this answer. I have also seen this trend in many whitepapers. Most of them make use of Ethereum with off-chain data. I was just wondering if Hyperledger might have been secure enough for health records. I do understand it makes more sens to do it off-chain especially when you will also be dealing with files. \n\nMy biggest issue at the moment is to cluster my Fabric network. I have been using Docker Swarm. I have come to a conclusion that I cant use docker-compose.yaml files on different nodes as they recreate the networks instead of joining.  My next steps are to use Kubernetes. \n\nWhat is the best way to cluster your Fabric network?  Hard coding IP addresses does not seem to be the answer. Setting up a DNS is also seems a bit extreme.

{"msg":"Some food for thought for our next meeting: It would be very useful from a privacy standpoint if we could implement zero knowledge proofs in our EHR record to IPFS like file pointers. Zero knowledge proofs could help with the de- identification of records problem. However, this would require the healthcare providers supply clean ( de-indentified data files to point towards) to maintain the privacy custody of the records. Currently, medical files, lab/ reports have the patient name or record numbers embedded within the headers. This might require a change in process for health care records in general unless we find a way to remove this identifier across all records. Something to discuss for the build.

Your idea of managing cryptocurrency payments is a good one, as much of what I imagine to be critical to the success of any blockchain solution is the valuation of data. In our context, it's patient data. That data needs to be valued using a some form of metric. Tokens are a good example of this, and would be used in a closed system that engages patient, payer, provider, etc. Stepping back a bit to a meta-level, I imagine that the work that you're doing permits the sharing of these valued datasets across enterprise domains. And the moment that this happens, you'll need a cross-domain means for the exchange of these currencies. Most interesting work!","username":"richbl","ts":"2018-07-06T17:35:47.256Z"}

There is a robust informal network of mothers sharing milk. If they had a way to go through some testing at the local lab and then get signed up to provide excess to the closest milk bank in exchange for pay, I think a lot of nursing moms would jump on that in a minute. Collecting and storing breastmilk is a PITA and most women aren't interested in doing that for free.  I see quite a bit of bartering in my own community.

{"msg":"Good Afternoon HLHCWG Team,\n\nI trust that you've had a great and productive week. Here in Seattle, the weather's certainly in transition, and the rain-showers of the autumn season have begun. \n\nAs many of you may know, the Hyperledger Healthcare Working Group (HLHCWG) came into formal existence just about one year ago with the initial publication of our HLHCWG Charter (https://www.hyperledger.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/HealthcareWGCharter_public.pdf).

{"msg":"Terminology confusion : Assets vs Resources  --- The concept of asset seems to be deeply embedded in the Hyperledger lexicon and is pervasive throughout documentation, code and WG discussions. However, it seems inappropriate for most use cases beyond certain areas of finance or accounting. The concept of resource seems more appropriate. For example, in a carbon trading market, a ton of carbon would be considered a liability rather than an asset. Likewise, medical waste in need of disposal would not be viewed as an asset.

{"msg":"@melias11 \nWelcome to the workgroup, and glad to have you join us. Please tell us a bit about your interests in blockchain technologies, Hyperledger in particular, and your professional background.\n\nTo your questions: you'll want to get on the calls with the Patient/Member Subgroup to discuss the details of your question re: FHIR. We're currently working with an outside party to help define and guide the project.

{"msg":"Reposting the response to @richbl's request on the mailing list. \n\nIt would be hard to add something that is out of the scope of the three initial questions that you listed because they are concerned with the why, where and how of the application of this technology to healthcare. I’ll try and list some questions that I’ve thinking about and maybe that would add value to your preparation for this conference, however, please let me add a disclaimer that I don’t consider myself any wiser for posting them and I hope that I can get some answers to these and improve my understanding of where we can go with this technology. \n\nIn my opinion, the crux of the problems that U.S. healthcare faces today can be encapsulated into the cost of care problem, quality of care problem and the coverage problem. And these three problems are connected. I will try and list out these problems in brief, which will help lead into the promises of blockchain technology to solve these problems and then pose questions that may inform us regarding applying it successfully to achieve the end goal of better healthcare. \n\nThe cost of care problem can be broken further down into the over utilization of services problem, the high cost of services problem, and the high administrative overhead problem. There is over utilization of services in healthcare today as shown by these examples: about 3 in 10 tests are reordered, 30% of the patients who visit the doctors office have their files missing and because doctors, practicing defensive medicine, order tests and services which might not be needed. It has been argued that over utilization is also a result of misaligned incentives for the providers and the data-brokers involved. Especially, in cases of patients with comorbidity, the patient data residing with one provider is not available to another one. \n\nWhich leads directly into the quality of care problem. Since provider don’t have access to a longitudinal health record for the patient; they have no choice but to have their patients fill out forms. And, there is risky reliance on the patient to remember their health history, which in several cases has proven harmful for provider, patients and ultimately everyone since we all share the cost. And on that note, consider that every provider fills out 20k forms each year and the healthcare industry in total pays for 15 billion transactions on the fax machine.  \n\nAgain, providers don’t have access to the longitudinal health record because of the misaligned incentives of the data-brokers in the healthcare ecosystem. It has been argued that the interoperability problem in healthcare is a business model problem. The cost of care also affects the quality of care in the sense that there is not enough incentives for most providers to practice preemptive/preventative health which is the major cause of concern for health of people in America in my opinion with 1 in 3 suffering from obesity, 1 in 3 from diabetes, 1 in 4 from cardiovascular problem, 1 in 5 from mental health problems - all that can be root-caused to behavior & lifestyle and further lead to other more serious health issues. Having more sick people further exacerbates the problem as there are limited number of doctors who can see them and we loop back into the cost of care problem and quality of care problems because small number of physicians charge higher salaries and don’t have enough time too see patients. \n\nThe coverage problem is that either most people in America don’t have coverage or are not directly involved in choosing coverage because they get it form their employer, medicare or medicaid. Which again loops back into the cost of care problem because there is over-utilization as people don’t pay for these services directly. A more fundamental disturbing truth is the very existence of the payer, separate from the provider and the consumer, which leads to administrative burdens for all parties involved through costs of pre-authorizations, billing, claims, disputes, waste, fraud all adding to the cost of care problem, quality of care problem and ultimately since there is expensive care at low quality, the coverage problem. \n\nAll of these problems bubble up in the form of metrics like, low life expectancy for Americans, high infant mortality rate, high rate of preventable diseases and the most glaring one - an expensive healthcare system paying ~20% in GDP for healthcare that works worse than other countries who pay much less.

{"msg":"While there have been solutions proposed to these problems viz. new forms of coverage and new provider payment models, I think they don’t have the disruptive potential of blockchains.

Which could mean a lot and I think can change the industry in many ways but I realize that this post is already going much longer than I intended so I’d jump right to the questions that I’ve been thinking about. \n\nHow can blockchain technology, today, help in coordination of care amongst multiple providers for a patient with comorbidity? What are the roadblocks there? \n\nWhat are the ramifications of issuing and verifying provider credentials through the blockchain? \n\nHow are the data-brokers in the healthcare industry responding to this technology - the HIEs, EHRs, EMRs, population health managers.

So, healthcare is my interest at numerous levels.\n\nFinally, interesting to hear about your observation at HIMSS17. I attended this year's HIMMS18 in Las Vegas, and manned one of the Hyperledger booths. My observation from those with whom I spoke was that blockchain as a concept was still really just out of reach for most IT professionals (at least those with whom I spoke). While I had expected to \"talk tech\" about the various Hyperledger frameworks/tools, the vast majority of my time was spent explaining blockchain at a much higher, abstracted level.

I thought the response by @KaranVerma was excellent, so I'll add just a couple of items for consideration and a few resources that may be of use. For supply chain, I'll offer how blockchain maps to the key requirements of the DSCSA (Drug Supply Chain Security Act) as well as an at-a-glance table of entities using blockchain for broader health supply chain management as two low-time-intensive ways to generate some specific questions: https://blockchainhealthcaretoday.com/index.php/journal/article/view/20/7. Also to an earlier comment, I agree that provider identities / credentialing is a critical use case; Procredex and TxMQ are probably the two most advanced in that space: https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12942-018-0144-x.

{"msg":"Thanks to @A.Courtney and @melias11 on the discussion of scope and approach for tasks for the #DonorMilk PoC. From a high level we identified 3 work streams: domain analysis (what we have on the wiki so far), Epic/task/backlog tracking on JIRA, and Developers taking on tasks from JIRA to implement the work. We see these all working in parallel. For the PoC specifically, we confirmed that scope is the path of taking the milk asset through the 'donate milk' and 'receive milk' scenarios that Mikhail has above.\n\nFor next steps Mikhail will work on a design document that will connect this flow to the CTO file components to help facilitate the build of a simplified CTO file and connection to the javascript back end that facilitates the movement of the asset through the flow. We'll plan to use our next #patient-member-subgroup meeting on 10/26 to review the design doc.

{"msg":"An interesting summary from the 2nd UN World Data Summit : \nhttp://enb.iisd.org/undata/worlddataforum/2018/html/enbplus232num2e.html\n\nIts great to see the increased focus on migration statistics, interoperability, statistical-geospatial integration and national statistical systems, along with increased attempts to improve the technical illiteracy of international organizations. Its unfortunate that over-hyped technologies that largely undermine sustainable development such as AI continue to hijack such proceedings. \n\nStrengthening statistical capacity, including data-driven planning and governance capacity for development program portfolios, is arguably the most critical priority -- and existential challenge -- for the tech industry today -- at least outside the Silicon Valley bubble. Blockchain platforms have the potential to provide a resilient, secure and trusted infrastructure to support such capacity-building activities, with potentially transformative impacts in terms of supporting compliance and combating fraud and abuse. The challenge will be getting the security and privacy design right -- and ensuring the technology contributes to building and safeguarding public trust.

The patient-member subgroup continues to work with the donor milk use case. Michael Johnson and I conducted an interview with a dietitian responsible for all NICU feeding (including donor milk) for a major hospital.

I think we need to try and do similar interviews and collect more data. I talked to Ben and he is willing to talk through a revision of the CTO file, but we want to ensure that any simplification of the file doesn't limit real world applicability. Ben also mentioned trying to find some organizations that would be willing to pilot this with us, if anyone is interested in working to build those relationships.

{"msg":" An interesting story in today's news : \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/21/faecal-transplant-researchers-identify-super-pooper-donors\n\nThe human microbiome has been an important research subject in recent years, with a growing number of therapeutic modalities being identified. Faecal tranplants have been a major breakthrough, with success in treating a growing list of conditions. This research paper suggests further work is needed to improve matching between donor and recipient - which could involve not only clinical and laboratory screening, but relying on accurate health and nutrition profiles. \n\nIts therefore worth considering the extent to which a market for human faecal donation could be developed - along the lines for milk donation. The high-level business processes are essentially the same, with a supply-side and demand-side. Its possible a faecal banking system may emerge to broker the network. \n\nIt may be worth exploring opportunities to partner with research organizations to develop this concept further, and possible establishing some type of blockchain-based clinical research trials framework to accelerate innovation. We do presently have gastroenterology and clinical informatics expertise as part of our SIG membership. \n\nConcretely, in the near term, it may be worth considering either redirecting or extending our focus from human milk to emerging faecal donation networks -- or even aiming to develop a general-purposes human tissue and organ donation engine.","username":"melias11","ts":"2019-01-21T11:38:17.790Z"}

{"msg":"---\n\nGood Day HC-SIG Team,\n\nI wanted to share with you two new opportunities to participate in healthcare-related challenges that were introduced in this morning's *HC-SIG General Meeting*.\n\nAs presented, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation is due to release later this month two new innovation challenges, both of which encompass the healthcare industry:\n\n- New Healthcare Challenge Opportunities\n  - Sponsored through the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\n    - Social Determinants of Healthcare (SDoH) Innovation Challenge\n      - Opens 2019.04.29\n      - Phase I deadline: 2019.06.07\n    - Home & Community Based Care Innovation Challenge\n      - Opens: 2019.04.29\n      - Phase I deadline: 2019.06.07\n\nI want to bring these two opportunities to your attention in the event that you might imagine challenge solutions that might happen to include blockchain technologies. Recall that HC-SIG membership numbers over 1000 members globally, and it's very likely that your idea to participate in one or both of these challenges might also be shared by a number of other HC-SIG members.\n\nSome considerations as you think through your challenge solutions: \n\n- Note the time frame: about one month for a Phase I submission\n- Read very carefully the terms/conditions of these challenges. Most open challenges/competitions are very particular about entrant/team qualifications\n- While the Linux Foundation/Hyperledger cannot promote/submit teams on its behalf, it is possible to form teams and discuss ideas through the forums of this organization\n\nAbsolutely feel free to use the HC-SIG listserv as a means for discussion. As well, you may want to use this HC-SIG Rocket.Chat channel for furthering discussions with potential teammates. \n\nRich","username":"richbl","ts":"2019-04-19T19:38:46.756Z"}

{"msg":"Rich, many thanks for the useful links.\nCAQH is a “non-profit alliance of health plans and trade associations, developing and leading initiatives that positively impact the business of healthcare.” The Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare is “essentially an online database that stores provider information. Providers grant access to their information to insurance companies. This makes acquiring provider information more efficient. Instead of calling your office for your work history or a copy of your medical license, insurance companies can go in and pull it directly from your file. 90% of the National Health Insurance Companies use CAQH and it is a prerequisite for their enrollment process.” (http://www.practicons.com/medical-credentialing/what-is-caqh/) \nBased on their website information, it seems that CAQH CORE (https://www.caqh.org/core/caqh-core) and HL7 have recently announced a collaboration to “Improve Interoperability Between Administrative and Clinical Systems.” This is a “collaboration to address long-standing healthcare industry challenges by accelerating automation and improving interoperability between administrative and clinical systems.”  \nIn summary, the CAQH’s mission statement seems to be based on improving the centralized database realization of semantic interoperability within and between administrative and clinical IT systems.\nI believe that minimizing the cost and maximizing the quality of the financing and delivery of inpatient and outpatient healthcare products and services by providers will ultimately depend on creating functional, structural and semantic interoperability for the efficient viewing, downloading and transmitting (sharing/exchanging) of the complex clinical transactions that occur between physicians and patients.\nRegrettably, as long as the hospitals and health IT system vendors continue to control their dominant  provider-centric (EHR) interoperability environment (where patients assume that wherever they go for care, their provider will have access to their entire healthcare history).the development of the semantic level of interoperability will remain beyond the reach of physicians and patients in their theoretical, patient-centric (PHR) interoperability environment (where patients could actually take shared ownership and operational control of their cumulative lifetime PHI as a \"single source of truth\").\nIt would be interesting to poll the HLHC-SIG, ONC and CAQH memberships to determine how many are clinicians and patients. I doubt there are any significant number of either stakeholder group.\nCAQH CORE: Operating Rules Streamline the Business of Healthcare\nMission\nDrive the creation and adoption of healthcare operating rules that support standards, accelerate interoperability, and align administrative and clinical activities among providers, payers and consumers.\nVision\nAn industry-wide facilitator of a trusted, simple and sustainable healthcare data exchange that evolves and aligns with market needs.\nBob\n","username":"BobColiMD","ts":"2019-10-01T23:23:44.781Z"}

{"msg":"There are a lot of projects that aren’t getting further than the theoretical and/or proof of concept phase. Is this because they aren’t presenting a valuable enough case or the value is too far out? Is it because it makes more sense to join a network than spend the cost to develop one? Am I wrong and a lot of projects are progressing? Is this normal for most new technologies? I am seeing some correlation with what happened with machine learning. Let me know if you have any thoughts to some of these questions.","username":"mikepica","ts":"2021-08-25T16:38:19.314Z"}
{"msg":"At the last meeting, we talked about patients being able to monetize their data. A limitation that was mentioned was that legally they are only able to receive $500-$1,000 annually for this. I’m wondering if patients could form a DAO, submit their data, and create a token. The token could appreciate based off the value of the data for compensation. The thought is they aren’t directly selling their data but benefiting from the collective use of it.","username":"mikepica","ts":"2021-09-05T16:11:27.112Z"}

This is federated learning and the institutions you noted above can keep their own data but still \"share\" it for machine learning models. Another project you may be interested in is the Synaptic Health Alliance https://www.synaptichealthalliance.com/about-us which is trying to create a chain across the networks for provider demographic data.","username":"mikepica","ts":"2021-09-10T11:30:46.899Z"}
