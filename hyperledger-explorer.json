{"msg":"@header340 ok so if you are hitting http://localhost:8080 correctly,  the error (Cannot read property 'foreach' in headerview.js) suggests the channel list is empty. And without a channel name, the app cannot fetch any data and hence the white screen. If the API call to get counts works, it cannot be a network connectivity issue, check config.json as for initial setup explorer reads from config file. Also Is your explorer code from release-3.1 branch or release-3.2 branch or master. If your network is fabric version 1.1.0, you need release-3.2. If your fabric network  is 1.0, explorer version 0.3.0 from master will work fine for you. If you originally had fabric 1.0 and want to migrate to 1.1.0, fabric provides an upgrade guide and then you can checkout explorer from release-3.2 branch and build. Besides that if you ran npm install in the blockchain-explorer directory and then again in client directory and ran 'npm run build' in client directory before starting up app, it should be good.

I just switched to release-3.2 and so far I'm seeing the same results.  Your comment about the channel list being empty is intriguing, however.  The config.json has the correct channel name but I did notice while logging into the PostgreSQL db and looking at the data within the tables, there is data within all the tables I would expect (Transactions, Peers, Chaincodes, Blocks, etc) but the Channel table is empty.  The data within the Chaincodes and Peer table show the correct channel name listed.  However, I do also notice in the Peer table that the Org an MSPID columns are empty.  Not sure if that's relevant or not.  I'm having trouble unweaving the architecture of both the main app as well as the web pages to figure out where the channel seems to get lost in translation.  Stupid question but it isn't a requirement to create the channel through this app is it?  My channel already exists and I'm expecting it to get picked up.

{"msg":"[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/hyperledger-explorer?msg=guFA4nM8b5Bh6iFLo) @vanitas92 I'm also unclear on the \"clients\" section so if anyone on here has definitive answer please jump in. My guess is it is related to the NodeSDK client config see here :https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/tutorial-network-config.html. The error you are seeing comes from here: https://github.com/hyperledger/blockchain-explorer/blob/master/app/platform/fabric/FabricClient.js line 116. I also had this error at one point. Reading the code, the first thing it does with fabric client after initialization is call queryChannels and if that returns empty...you get this error. So, either there are no channels on your network or, more likely, the config is wrong somehow and its not able to connect.  I would suggest this...take the url to the peer you are connecting to (the one matching organization in the clients section) then remote on to your explorer pod and try a cmd like this: nc -zv {{your_hostname_or_ip_from_url_property}} {{port_from_url}}  If this doesn't return open then you have some sort of network issue or your config is wrong. Other things to check that the certs and keys in your config.json are actually there.

For example: \n\nfabric-ca-client register --id.name ica --id.attrs '\"hf.Registrar.Roles=user,peer\",hf.Revoker=true,hf.IntermediateCA=true' --id.secret icapw \nSecondly, open intermediate ca home directory and initialize the intermediate ca: \nfabric-ca-server init -b icaadmin:icaadminpw -u http://ica:icapw@localhost:7054 \nChange port of intermediate ca (8054) and some other settings of intermediate ca in fabric-ca-server-config.yaml file. \n\nAfter that, you can start intermediate ca: \n\nfabric-ca-server start\n``` ","username":"Ferrymania","ts":"2018-10-11T06:32:09.050Z"}

{"msg":"Hello there ! I am using HL Explorer in Docker and the log files under `logs/app` are filling very quicly, to the point that the log file of one day is over 5 GB. The log files are actually filled with the same `SyncServices - Block synch in process for >> first-network_mychannel` line, repeated many thousand times per second. I identified it comes from the `app/platform/fabric/sync/SyncService.js` file (here https://github.com/hyperledger/blockchain-explorer/blob/master/app/platform/fabric/sync/SyncService.js#L350) with a call to logger.info(). As the logging level is not set in the file (using logger.setLevel) I don't think the level can be changed by passing an env variable. So I basically have two questions:\n- is it normal to have this function called so often that it prints the log many thousand times per second, or is there something wrong on my side?\n- is there a way to change the logging level, other than building my custom image with a `logger.setLevel` line added to the SyncService.js file?\nThank you !","username":"skyfan","ts":"2019-11-29T09:45:50.035Z"}

{"msg":"[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/hyperledger-explorer?msg=6eHA3pAFcGp7Hnvb3) AFAIK u can't if the network is up and running. But if u are building from the scratch then u can add `1.2.3.4 peer0.org1.com ` in the `/etc/hosts` file.\n In the docker-compose we use `extra_hosts` that will create the same mapping in the container's `/etc/hosts` file.\nA silly answer is try `peer0.org1.com 1.2.3.4` in the `/etc/hosts` file.

Also if there is no token in the localStorage, the client will automatically redirect itself to /login.\n\nSo am I missing something here or doesn't \"enableAuthenitcation: false\" work?

{"msg":"Hello guys! I'm trying to run a simple integration example between Fabric and Explorer, which can be found on this tutorial: https://medium.com/coinmonks/blockchain-explorer-integration-with-hyperledger-fabric-fc14570753f7. Besides this tutorial, I followed all the steps explained on blockchain-explorer repository (https://github.com/hyperledger/blockchain-explorer), using the codebase tutorial for that (instead of the docker one). Even though I did everything that I was supposed to do, I couldn't run the explorer. I don't know if the port would be the problem (as I can't access http://localhost:8080/ after running ./start.sh) or if I still have some steps to follow to fix it. I also took some print screens to show the logs and the paths configured, that are shown below. I'd really appreciate if someone could help me. Thanks!","username":"Gavimat","ts":"2021-07-28T17:28:26.700Z"}

When using the docker quick start, I am able to run it smoothly, however when using the codebase quick start, the node server doesn't seem to start, although I have successfully created the DB, build the app, use the correct dependencies, etc. (I am using the codebase as I need to modify the UI a little bit).
