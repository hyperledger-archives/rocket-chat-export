Hey everyone
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Mon, 04 Jan 2021 23:06:13 GMT):<br/>
Hi Roger!
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 04 Jan 2021 23:37:05 GMT):<br/>
hey @Lumenphotovideo and @pandrejko :)
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 00:10:17 GMT):<br/>
Hey guys, we've been going through all the info you have shared with us.  Can you clarify for us this:
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 00:11:14 GMT):<br/>
are we looking to promote translation all over hyperledger or "fabric?"
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 00:11:40 GMT):<br/>
reading through the blog draft, it talks about HL Fabric throughout.  Is that what we should focus our attention on?
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 00:11:56 GMT):<br/>
or do we talk about that HL wants to translate everything?
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 00:12:26 GMT):<br/>
looking through the annual report, Fabric and home page are the two that say they have been translated
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 00:27:41 GMT):<br/>
Fabric is the most active group by far
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 00:28:35 GMT):<br/>
so, the opportunity is everywhere, but we want to highlight the work Fabric is doing
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 00:28:43 GMT):<br/>
ok cool
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 00:29:10 GMT):<br/>
Highlight / reward
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 00:30:02 GMT):<br/>
follow up question:  "if i don't care about fabric, is this video still for me if im involved in other HL projects?"
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 02:02:30 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Wed, 06 Jan 2021 02:21:10 GMT):<br/>
ok thanks

Script:

Hyperledger is an open source project that was born from the combined desire and effort of various individuals, businesses, and organizations that were inspired to expand the usefulness of blockchain while developing an avenue for innovation within the community in the process. 

Hyperledger and each of its associated tools have become a global resource because of its open source foundation...yet...there is one major roadblock that prevents the project from truly being as open and productive as intended. 

English is the original language of the software...yet...80% of the world does not natively speak that language. So can something truly be considered open source if millions of potential users across the world are closed off by the barrier of language?

In 2019 , HL Fabric, spearheaded an initiative to translate all documents to as many languages as possible. In a short time, the HL community has already begun to grow and reap the rewards of opening up to all new regions. 

The first wave of adopters translated Fabric documentation into Chinese.


...China interview…

This quickly inspired a team of people in India to follow suit.

...India interview…

Since then, we’ve already added 6 more countries/languages to the Fabric family but we’re only just getting started. 

...third interview…

Brain Behlendorph, the Executive Director of Hyperledger described the software as… “an open sourced community...of communities…” 

There are countless people in your community right now that are only held back by the need for translation to the language you speak.

So we need your help to bridge that gap. 

If you have the ability to translate english to your language, visit our translation page where we’ve laid out simple step by step instructions and resources to get you started. (EXPAND BUT WE NEED TO KNOW MORE FROM HL TEAM.)


This translation effort has already begun to open doors within several individual communities but Hyperledger is a living worldwide ecosystem and every new member can bring unique talents and ideas to the global community that benefits us all, as long as they have the ability to participate. 

This is an invitation for you to be the person that makes that happen.

@Lumenphotovideo -- I saw you make some updates to the wiki so wanted to see if you're ready for us to add feedback.  is this the right page to comment on?  https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/DT/English+Script%3A+Current+Draft
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 16:56:43 GMT):<br/>
Hey david!  almost.  I will send out an email to you as soon as im ready
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 16:56:50 GMT):<br/>
just making final adjustments and what not
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 16:57:11 GMT):<br/>
i shared the draft video around with some people internally yesterday and had positive feedback -- the one suggestion they had was to try to shorten it a bit so i can make a pass at removing some words whenever you're ready.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 16:57:13 GMT):<br/>
it should be ready to go here momentarily.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 16:57:15 GMT):<br/>
ok, sounds good
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 16:57:42 GMT):<br/>
ok that's awesome that you did that and that fresh eyes had good feedback!
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 16:59:37 GMT):<br/>
yes, any fat you can remove from the script will help.  The biggest element that will contribute the most to the over all length will be the on camera interviews from our participants. with this latest note, we'll make sure to focus on having them deliver the most condensed answer as possible for them, so those sections don't run long
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 22:01:59 GMT):<br/>
@Lumenphotovideo I spoke with Chris Gabriel and he said he is happy to do the narration. Chris is also part of our Fabric Documentation workgroup. He owns his own company that provides Blockchain services.
chris@hyperchainlabs.com
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 20:39:52 GMT):<br/>
Ok that's awesome.  Ill follow up with him
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 20:40:15 GMT):<br/>
also, all emails went out to our 6 volunteers.  will keep you posted on progress.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 25 Jan 2021 15:33:34 GMT):<br/>
Morning team.  Just went over and adjusted all the script notes.  Thanks for those, they were really good!
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 25 Jan 2021 17:49:08 GMT):<br/>
Also, threw up a quick page for tracking status on our volunteers so you have an idea of where we are with them.

@Lumenphotovideo -- thanks for going through all of our feedback.  i read the script earlier today and think it looks great.  i just had one more minor tweak.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 25 Jan 2021 23:23:16 GMT):<br/>
was it the "people" note?  if so, changed it.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 26 Jan 2021 00:55:59 GMT):<br/>
yes, that was the note

<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 29 Jan 2021 14:31:22 GMT):<br/>
Just wanted to share with you all the answers that Yang and Junjie sent us.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 29 Jan 2021 14:31:47 GMT):<br/>
From first glance, I feel the answers are really good.  They stayed high level but have specific points.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 29 Jan 2021 14:32:17 GMT):<br/>
Can you look these over and let me know if there's any feedback you'd like me to send back to them or if you feel these answers are good for you?

<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 29 Jan 2021 14:33:17 GMT):<br/>
1. Why was it important to translate the Fabric documentation into your language?

I have been studied blockchain technology since 2018 from Fabric. At that time, we don't have much more learning meterials but the official documents, partial documents are translated by the TWGC volunteers, but the Fabric is updated so quick that I have to read the English version, it is not easy for me at the beginning, and I believe that it is the same as many Chinese developers.Then I decided to make some cotributions for the community and began to translate the documents, so that other developers can learn the Fabric more easier.

     2. What was the documentation translation experience like for you or your team?

Translating is a hard work, there would be at least two hours to translate one article for me, and some long articles may take more time, after that we also need another translator to review the translations before upload. Fabric official documents is really a big book and released frequently, we can't follow the latest version, we usually based on a fixed version such as v1.4.2,so sometimes we can also receives some complains from the reader. Fortunately, with the efforts of many volunteers, we have been finished the translations of v1.4.2, and the v2.2.0 is almost done, after that we will continuly update the translations followed by English version and fix the errors in the translations.

     3. Can you give us an example of a benefit in having the doc translated into your language?

The process of translating is also the process of learning, I have been translated the documents since 2019 from 1.2 version to 2.0 version, I am very familar with the documents, though some Fabric features I never used in my work, I know the basic principles and usage, so I passed the CHFA exam and got the certificate easily. And also my contributions are approved by the community members, so I was elected as the chairman of TWGC in 2021 term.

     4. Why is it important to you to recruit more people to help translate the documentation?

Many of us are from Fabric open source community and dedicated to sharing and contributing all kinds of technical improvements and instructions. But indeed each individual's energy and professional competence are limitted, and as a result, many things aren't polished very well such that many translations may have a few errors and translation progress lags behind English document. Therefore, we hope more volunteers can take part in the translation work, but of course not only translations, you can try many other orientations as well. Here, you can find friends with common goal and contribute together.

     5. How do you feel this effort has expanded the Fabric community?

The Chinese docouments translated by us helped many new Fabric developers, and many developers are asking Chinese document links in WeChat (Chinese social media app) group. Also contributors often make pull request in github for either correcting errors or applying translation tasks. In addition, TWGC releases seasonal contribution lists, one of which is the translation contribution list consisting of translators' name and organization. That greatly attracts some developers to contribute on behalf of their companies and many contributors are willing to show up as top 3 on the list.

<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 29 Jan 2021 15:09:19 GMT):<br/>
Also, update on languages that have confirmed and have a recording date:  Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese and waiting hear back from Aneena (Malayalam) to schedule.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 29 Jan 2021 15:10:00 GMT):<br/>
No french or spanish responses yet.  If they do not respond, we would be just fine with the four above for the video.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 29 Jan 2021 15:27:49 GMT):<br/>
Yup. We can't want it more than they do.

hey team.  so chris sent over these three options for his shirt.  they're the same style, just different colors.  Are you good with this "look" for him as our "narrator"
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 29 Jan 2021 19:22:40 GMT):<br/>
it works for me if this works for you all
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 13:31:37 GMT):<br/>
I prefer the crisper look of the first one
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 13:35:50 GMT):<br/>
@Lumenphotovideo Would you like me to add an edited version of their responses in English?
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 13:56:18 GMT):<br/>
Hi Pam, Ill pass the word to chris on the shirt.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 13:56:25 GMT):<br/>
as for the answers, yes, that would be great.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 13:56:49 GMT):<br/>
I sent an email with wiki link where i copied the answers.  Could you add your notes/changes there please.
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 13:56:56 GMT):<br/>
Will do!
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 15:03:50 GMT):<br/>
thanks
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 15:41:58 GMT):<br/>
@Lumenphotovideo -- if you're not hearing back from the french or spanish groups, let me know and i can follow up with them.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 15:50:30 GMT):<br/>
Hey David.  I have not heard back from either Claudio or Oumar.  we have sent follow up emails.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 15:51:02 GMT):<br/>
Aneena, im just waiting to confirm her call, and everyone else is scheduled for this week to shoot
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 15:51:11 GMT):<br/>
here's our current stats:

</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 17:20:44 GMT):<br/>
ok, i'll ping claudio and oumar today
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 17:21:19 GMT):<br/>
and good to hear we have the flexibility where it is ok if they're not available
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 17:30:37 GMT):<br/>
yeah, im really liking the energy and answers were getting from the ones we got, so if we get the others, its gravy at this point
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 17:31:28 GMT):<br/>
also, tomorrow we are shooting chris, and then wed and Thursday the others.  so by the end of the week, we'll have everyone plugged into the edit and we'll be able to see if there is a lack of answers anywhere
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 17:31:51 GMT):<br/>
i will most likely have a super rough edit for you all to see next monday the 8th.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 17:32:15 GMT):<br/>
cool.
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 17:33:54 GMT):<br/>
Claudio was on vacation but said he will respond to you today
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 17:35:12 GMT):<br/>
yes, just got his email now and were chatting.  thanks for reaching out to him
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 19:28:50 GMT):<br/>
really glad to hear you're liking the energy and answers you're getting and that things are coming together quickly.  excited to see a rough edit.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 20:28:00 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, so far everyone is into to and have been very accommodating.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 15:18:19 GMT):<br/>
Morning team!  emailed out the wiki link for japanese answers.  Let me know when you have a chance to look those over.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 15:25:29 GMT):<br/>
Today i am recording Chris.  At the end of the video, id like to put up a web address for the viewer to go to.  what do you guys want that to be?
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 15:25:31 GMT):<br/>
the blog?
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 15:25:40 GMT):<br/>
or will you have a specific landing page for the campaing
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 15:29:42 GMT):<br/>
Good question
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 16:20:22 GMT):<br/>
@Lumenphotovideo -- good question.  my thought on a link was something easy for people to type in.  so perhaps a redirect that then points to the fabric docs contribute page.  and when we get a more general translation contribution page we could update the redirect to point there.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 16:20:36 GMT):<br/>
so maybe hyperledger.org/translate?
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 16:21:36 GMT):<br/>
@rjones -- brian was wanting to have a way to see stats on any link we include in the link.  do you know if we can set up a redirect that shows up in google analytics or that can be tracked another way?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 16:22:14 GMT):<br/>
@davidwboswell I'd ask marketing how to do it
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 18:34:42 GMT):<br/>
ok, i'll ask jess.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 18:45:52 GMT):<br/>
and @Lumenphotovideo -- the japanese interview looks great too.  sounds like you're getting really good content from everyone
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 19:55:50 GMT):<br/>
yeah, i liked the answers as well.  and they're really keeping it short, which is great for total running time!
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 19:56:05 GMT):<br/>
also, just finished recording with Chris.  He did a great job and was so easy to work with
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 19:56:11 GMT):<br/>
we kept his set up simple.
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 19:56:24 GMT):<br/>
I was thinking about you guys!
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 19:56:35 GMT):<br/>
he was in fromt of a plain wall, which will be good to not get too "busy"
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 19:56:42 GMT):<br/>
he reads well
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 19:56:49 GMT):<br/>
haha!!
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 19:57:04 GMT):<br/>
This is good promotion for him too.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 19:57:23 GMT):<br/>
for sure
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 19:57:50 GMT):<br/>
tomorrow I shoot with china and brazil
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 19:57:59 GMT):<br/>
and thursday with japan and joe for english
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 19:58:25 GMT):<br/>
Aneena hasn't gotten back to me yet but Claudio has, and his shoot may be this week
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 17:46:51 GMT):<br/>
@Lumenphotovideo @pandrejko -- to follow up on the URL question for end of the video, i've set up a link at hyperledger.org/translate that points to the fabric docs contribution guide.  let me know your thoughts -- we could change the short URL to something else or have it point somewhere else.  at some point in the future we'd want to build a page about all sorts of translation opportunities, but the fabric specific one is what we have now so let's point to that.
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 17:47:52 GMT):<br/>
I like that. Anything else would be hard to remember since they can't click on it or copy/paste it.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 17:48:17 GMT):<br/>
that works out perfect.  i had chris verbalize that link :)
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 17:48:34 GMT):<br/>
if it needs to change, no worries, he's good with recording anything else we need from him
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 18:22:38 GMT):<br/>
great.  glad that link works.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 23:35:19 GMT):<br/>
just recorded portuguese and renato was awesome
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 15:56:17 GMT):<br/>
@Lumenphotovideo -- i really like renato.  glad to hear he was awesome :)
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 16:46:39 GMT):<br/>
we just got Japanese interview.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 16:46:52 GMT):<br/>
all went well.  she is sending revised answers
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 19:27:23 GMT):<br/>
Ok, so we got Claudio's answers (spanish).  When you get a chance, can you look them over.  they are by far the shortest ones, haha
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 19:27:25 GMT):<br/>
really short
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 19:27:30 GMT):<br/>
but still usable i think

<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 21:42:25 GMT):<br/>
I edited Claudio's responses Was not sure about #5 though
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 21:43:15 GMT):<br/>
claudio's answers look good to me.  short and sweet seems fine :)
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 22:29:31 GMT):<br/>
ok awesome.  we just got Joes answers, so that's done.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 22:29:35 GMT):<br/>
One question
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 22:30:21 GMT):<br/>
Oumar just reached out today and was seeing about scheduling sometime next week.  At this point, we have spanish, japanese, chinese and Portuguese.  For my needs, Im good with those languages.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 22:30:33 GMT):<br/>
so my question is, do we still want to record french?
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 22:30:52 GMT):<br/>
if we do, and want to use it for the video, that could delay us on the editing side
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 22:31:26 GMT):<br/>
part of the message is based on what they said.  so i wouldn't want to get far in the edit, and then have to adjust for another answer
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 22:31:46 GMT):<br/>
now, we can still record him and use it for other non-video needs, like website or blog
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 22:33:13 GMT):<br/>
I'm OK with no French video. I can reach out to him directly to get his answers and then use that in the blog.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 15:05:11 GMT):<br/>
One more thing.  Aneena has been responding but with big gaps in between days, so I have not been able to get our initial chat going.  Which means that would be next week for them to record at the earliest.  What would you like to do with them as well?
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 15:30:19 GMT):<br/>
What would recording her next week do to the overall schedule?
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 15:47:15 GMT):<br/>
Might be good to have a quick meeting this afternoon to agree on strategy here if you guys are available?
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 15:52:48 GMT):<br/>
i'm free after 10:30 pacific today if we do want to meet
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 15:57:14 GMT):<br/>
oumar actually joined my call with claudio, not sure how he got link.  but about to get on chat with him now in 5
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 15:57:57 GMT):<br/>
after my mtg, i am headed to a video shoot and won't be available till later this afternoon, around 3pmCentral
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 15:58:35 GMT):<br/>
if you want to discuss amongst yourselves and let me know what you think, that would work for me too
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 15:59:09 GMT):<br/>
ok.  generally speaking i'd like to do what we need to keep to the schedule.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 15:59:41 GMT):<br/>
for aneena, it would be great to include her if we can.  if not, we can record her when we can and make that available separately.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 16:00:52 GMT):<br/>
ok sounds good.  ill let you know how it goes with Oumar
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 16:01:06 GMT):<br/>
could you guys reach out to Aneena? maybe a nudge would help
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 16:01:22 GMT):<br/>
i was awaiting on them confirming a time to chat, but hadn't heard back
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 16:11:04 GMT):<br/>
ok so Oumar is going to work on his answers over the weekend and have them to us for monday.  Once we see his answers, we can determine if we want to include any in the video.  If we do, ill just leave a gap in the edit until i get his recording.  He's available next week so i would think by wednesday we can record him
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 16:11:29 GMT):<br/>
also mentioned to him that even if we didn't use his parts in the video, his recordings are still useful for the web page
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 16:11:42 GMT):<br/>
sure. How many recordings are in the can?
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 16:13:48 GMT):<br/>
we have Chinese, Japanese, Spanish and Portugues
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 16:14:17 GMT):<br/>

i'll reach out to aneena
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 18:51:54 GMT):<br/>
That's great about Oumar. Sounds like he is ready to respond quickly so if you have the time to create a video with him then that's great and you can decide whether it makes sense to include it or not.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 19:10:38 GMT):<br/>
fyi, aneena said she'd be following up with roger soon.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 22:25:15 GMT):<br/>
Ok ok both. Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 16:57:47 GMT):<br/>
Morning Team!  Just to give you an update.  Working throughout the day today puzzle piecing the answers into place and getting a rough cut together.  I will email link once i have it ready.  Most likely will be later this evening.  will keep you posted!
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 18:37:34 GMT):<br/>
great.  looking forward to seeing it :)
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 15:38:27 GMT):<br/>
Morning team.  just sent out email with video link as well as the script link.  Please take a look when you can and let me know what you think.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 15:38:53 GMT):<br/>
Also, Oumar sent in his French Answers.  We reviewed them while figuring out which answers to use and didnt really need any of his.  For my purposes I dont need him recorded.  Would you guys like him recorded like the others for your end, or is text enough?
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 15:39:50 GMT):<br/>
here are his answers:

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 15:53:46 GMT):<br/>
@Lumenphotovideo take out the Composer graphic at 0:10
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 15:53:46 GMT):<br/>
@Lumenphotovideo please take out the Composer graphic at 0:10
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 15:54:34 GMT):<br/>
Please put the Besu graphic in the center where the Composer graphic is now.
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 15:56:30 GMT):<br/>
Wow! This is really coming together nicely. Everything is fitting together so well. A few things I noticed - 
- The sub-titles are overwritten by the video progress line when the video is not full screen, which is distracting and makes it hard to read. Would it make sense for them to be slightly higher on the screen?
- I think it would be nice to add mention of who all these people are - as you have suggested. The blank white walls behind them could potentially benefit from some graphics
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 15:58:32 GMT):<br/>
Hey Pam, glad you like!  Ill make the adjustment on the subtitles.  One other thing that could help is i can keep it to a single line
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 15:58:42 GMT):<br/>
yeah. I don't know who the guy speaking at 2:28 is - I like the idea of titles
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 15:58:43 GMT):<br/>
that way it would hopefully sit "over" the bar
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 15:59:51 GMT):<br/>
hey ry, ok cool.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 16:00:09 GMT):<br/>
so I really like this cut, it's nice.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 16:01:01 GMT):<br/>
awesome.  its only going to get better!
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 16:01:35 GMT):<br/>
I feel adding more people (Oumar) would not benefit the flow so much. Personally, at 4 minutes, it's about as long as I'd want it to be :)
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 16:02:31 GMT):<br/>
i agree on time
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 16:03:37 GMT):<br/>
We probably have graphics for Avalon, Indy, Caliper, Besu, and Quilt that would contrast better on the background. Or maybe we have a better background graphic we could provide
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 16:05:08 GMT):<br/>
Thats section is a logo placeholder.  i was playing around with those over a white background, which would contrast much better.  Also was thinking of bringing them in differently.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 16:05:12 GMT):<br/>
the only other ones I have are black and white, which is not awesome
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 16:05:20 GMT):<br/>
ill show you an ex
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 16:05:21 GMT):<br/>
OK, cool. I didn't know where that came from

maybe when he says frameworks, light up the framework logos, tools, libraries the same time
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 16:07:57 GMT):<br/>
ooh i like that
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 16:08:07 GMT):<br/>
I like the white background version

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 16:08:56 GMT):<br/>
I don't know how strongly I feel about the "official language" thing, but I know Brian will have strong feelings
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 16:09:03 GMT):<br/>
ok.  ill go with that.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 16:09:10 GMT):<br/>
was just reading your note
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 16:09:18 GMT):<br/>
we can have him re record if needed
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 16:10:17 GMT):<br/>
I think since this represents the Fabric campaign, it doesn't need re-recorded.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 16:10:28 GMT):<br/>
yeah
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 16:10:29 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 16:12:34 GMT):<br/>
I like the upbeat energy throughout
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 16:17:59 GMT):<br/>
awesoem
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 16:18:13 GMT):<br/>
i also need to go and adjust sub titles so they read a little easier
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 16:18:25 GMT):<br/>
in reference to where i separate sentences from one to anothter
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 16:28:52 GMT):<br/>
have the speakers given notes on when they're saying certain things?
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 16:31:16 GMT):<br/>
i actually need them to confirm that i cut them where i think i cut them.  haha!
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 17:20:54 GMT):<br/>
^^ I was wondering about that. We would definitely want them to review the placement of the subtitles
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 18:33:12 GMT):<br/>
I will keep hammering out this draft and will have another link for you guys to review by end of day Friday.  If you think of anything else, please feel free to let me know anytime
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 22:15:38 GMT):<br/>
for oumar, if he doesn't fit that's fine.  i think it would still be useful to record him so we have a french video to share.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 22:15:55 GMT):<br/>
and i'm behind on watching -- am going to check it out now.  had a busy morning :)
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 22:23:00 GMT):<br/>
@Lumenphotovideo -- i think it is really great.  i caught some small issues, but nothing big.  for instance, the word 'limitation' seems like it is mispelled at the end as 'limitiation'.  i think i caught a mispelling in the subtitles with renato with 'answeres'.  and perhaps showing a translated version of the home page instead of the english home page will reinforce the point more.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 22:23:38 GMT):<br/>
those are just smaller tweaks though.  really happy with how it is coming together.  i can either go back through more closely to look for more of those small issues or can wait until your next edit -- let me know what would be helpful.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 22:24:45 GMT):<br/>
i'll share internally as well to see if there is any other feedback from that group.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Wed, 10 Feb 2021 15:21:27 GMT):<br/>
Hey David, thanks for the feedback!.  Correct on all those.  No need to comb through it again because this is a first draft edit.  On the next cut, you'll see more visuals or corrected visuals.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Wed, 10 Feb 2021 15:23:20 GMT):<br/>
I received an email from Dr. Jubilant, reaching out about the recording.  I will let him know that for me I don't need the recording but would you like him to go ahead and send answers for the blog?
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Wed, 10 Feb 2021 15:28:22 GMT):<br/>
@Lumenphotovideo -- for Dr. Jubilant, if it is possible to capture his recording so we have some malayalam content for that team to use, that would be great.  if not, sending him the note and encouraging him to record something himself would work too.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Wed, 10 Feb 2021 15:28:42 GMT):<br/>
and i shared the rough cut with some other staff and want to pass along their feedback.  some of these points we've already discussed:
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Wed, 10 Feb 2021 15:28:43 GMT):<br/>
Agree that names of speakers, and language need to be added can't assume everyone know what language it is
at minute :08 some of the logos do not show well
minute 1:49 translation says "Living in Japan, I feel it is difficult to find information about Fabric unless it is in Japanese." doesn't make sense does she mean she only finds english docs?
Is there a way to blur the backgrounds on all the talking heads, so there is a bit more consistency from person to person
Japanese speaker her voice is lower so either bump that up or lower music background across the whole video
and end- Limitation is misspelled
I think?? there was a All are Welcom sign at HGF in multiple languages would be ice to add that if we can find it
Yeah!
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Wed, 10 Feb 2021 15:33:48 GMT):<br/>
ok awesome
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Wed, 10 Feb 2021 15:34:16 GMT):<br/>
all good to go on the notes and i do remember seeing that HGF sign
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Wed, 10 Feb 2021 15:34:19 GMT):<br/>
ill dig it up
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Wed, 10 Feb 2021 15:34:52 GMT):<br/>
i willl ask bot Oumar and Dr. Jubilant if they can go ahead and record themselves answering the questions.
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Wed, 10 Feb 2021 15:43:38 GMT):<br/>
Also I noticed Chris' voice was very strong at the beginning but the 1st Chinese speaker immediately following him was a little soft, it might be good if you could make him a little louder - just so there is not so much of a contrast in voice?
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Wed, 10 Feb 2021 15:59:24 GMT):<br/>
hi pam.  correct on that as well.  i  do a few audio mixing passes before the final export so those differences get smoothed out.
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Thu, 11 Feb 2021 22:28:49 GMT):<br/>
@Lumenphotovideo Would it be OK if I shared the first cut video with our Documentation Team tomorrow (Chris and Joe will likely be on the call)
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 19:24:37 GMT):<br/>
@pandrejko -- thanks for drafting the blog post to use for kicking off the translation campaign.  i took a pass and made some edits:
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 19:24:38 GMT):<br/>
added title
combined two images in page into one that are side by side
added screenshot of chinese docs in section about chinese docs
added placeholder for video
tweaked the text in a few places
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 19:25:03 GMT):<br/>
if anyone else here is interested in reviewing and editing that post, it is at https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/DT/English+blog
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 22:18:14 GMT):<br/>
Thanks David.
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 22:24:16 GMT):<br/>
All looks good to me.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 22 Feb 2021 22:06:06 GMT):<br/>
is there a specific video you guys are aware of that has translated subtitles that you think would be a good visual example?
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 22 Feb 2021 22:06:20 GMT):<br/>
for the part where we discuss "other things to translate, like subtitles"
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 22 Feb 2021 23:05:56 GMT):<br/>
found one.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 19:07:27 GMT):<br/>
great, glad you found one
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 15:38:35 GMT):<br/>
Morning team, doing last touches on graphics and sound mixing on the edit.  Will have the link to share here shortly.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 17:29:34 GMT):<br/>
Ok, just sent out an email with some notes and link.  Take a look when you can and let me know what you think!
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 17:50:41 GMT):<br/>
Done. Notes sent, one graphic and some typos
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Wed, 24 Feb 2021 23:07:50 GMT):<br/>
Ok here are two initial proof of concepts for the video thumbnail.  working on narrowing down a direction.  do you like either of these?

<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 15:20:42 GMT):<br/>
@Lumenphotovideo -- having photos is good.  i wouldn't want to have people feel excluded though, so for instance renato is in the video but not in the thumbnail.  could we focus the photos on the translators who are in the video?  and for a title to use in the thumbnail, i'd suggest a call to action like 'Getting involved with translations'.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 17:35:38 GMT):<br/>
hey david, yeah all sounds good.  We'll work on a second version of the photo one.  Ill reach out to them to see if they can send us a photo of themselves
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 18:28:28 GMT):<br/>
great
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 18:28:48 GMT):<br/>
and if you're not hearing back, i can help.  maybe i could grab their profile pics from linkedin.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 18:32:33 GMT):<br/>
ok yeah.  i would say go ahead and check LinkedIn and let me know if you can't get any or if they are not good, and ill reach out to those
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 18:45:48 GMT):<br/>
Have a subtitle question for you guys.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 18:50:56 GMT):<br/>
For Japanese and Chinese, I adjusted the subtitles here and there where the breaks in the subtitles are, to what felt good to read.  If you don't know the language, you will have no idea if my timing is on point or off.   (Portuguese I understand enough that i know is timed good).  I can ask our contributors if they can let me know if the timing is off, but Im feeling like that might not really make much of a difference.  Are you guys good with the way the subtitles read or do you want me to see if they can check timing?  My other thought is that their english is not good spoken and not sure if they can read english, so not sure how helpful it would be.
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 18:53:03 GMT):<br/>
IMO For a 4 min video I think it is fine as is.
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 18:56:00 GMT):<br/>
@rjones Do you know who is the "leader" of the russian translation group?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 19:00:32 GMT):<br/>
I do not. That has been fairly contentious
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 19:02:08 GMT):<br/>
ok on the subtitles.  thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 19:04:24 GMT):<br/>
@pandrejko [this guy](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-docs-i18n/pull/80) did a bunch of work and was told to pound sand, which is... not awesome
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 19:20:09 GMT):<br/>
A note about contributors.  I got a response from Dr. Jubilant almost two weeks ago but never heard back after responding  Also, Oumar never responded a second time either.  I have not followed up with them as i was focusing on the edit.  What would you like to do with them.  Do we want to reach out again to see if they can record video for the blog or let it go?

<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 23:12:49 GMT):<br/>
agreed.  i like the color version better

<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 23:12:56 GMT):<br/>
thanks for putting that thumbnail together

<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 23:13:35 GMT):<br/>
ok, ill need to get a color pic from Satomi, ill email her.  otherwise, are you guys happy with the thumbnail? anything you want to change?
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 23:14:26 GMT):<br/>
minor suggestion but maybe make the 'getting involved with translations' text just a little bigger.  when the image is smaller it might be hard to read.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 23:14:54 GMT):<br/>
yeah for sure.  we've got plenty of room for that
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Thu, 25 Feb 2021 23:15:04 GMT):<br/>
great
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 14:51:41 GMT):<br/>
Good morning team, happy Friday!

So today I will be exporting our final video and will upload to my vimeo for your final review.  Assuming everything is good to go, it will be ready to upload to HL's YouTube channel.  

Im just waiting on some pics for the thumbnail, but what ill do is get it done today with whatever we have and as they come in, we can replace the thumbnail image.


Question in regards to translations.  Our original idea was to have our contributors do the translations.  One thing I noticed is that some of them just used google translate or another software.  So that got me looking around at translation options and I found one that is really inexpensive and would have a quicker turn around than if we have contributors do it.

I found a website called rev.com.  The process is super easy and within their site, they can not only translate but they will go ahead and put the translation on YT.  And all translations are time stamped to follow the video correctly.

We had talked about these languages as the ones we wanted to have translated.

Japanese
Chinese
Portuguese
French
Russian
Spanish
Malayalam
Tamil

They can translate all of these except for Malayalam and Tamil and would only cost $150 with a 24-48 hour turnaround.  

What do you all think about using this service and then having a contributor do Malayalam and Tamil?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 15:55:59 GMT):<br/>
I say go for it, we have a native Malayalam speaker in the community (Vipin)
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 16:25:24 GMT):<br/>
Vipin!  met him last year at the forum.  he's awesome
</p>

got an updated thumbnail.  how's this look to you
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 16:37:09 GMT):<br/>
went ahed and made the call to action across the bottom from side to side
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 16:37:25 GMT):<br/>
junjie is going to send me a pic and waiting to see if satomi sends a color pic
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 17:44:57 GMT):<br/>
He's in your video a couple times
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 18:57:33 GMT):<br/>
the thumbnail looks great.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 18:58:44 GMT):<br/>
and for translations, i'd prefer to have community members do it.  it seems a bit odd to me to not have community translate a video about community translators.  and many of the translators do use google translate, but that's just a starting place -- my understanding is that there is a lot of polish needed but the google translate gets them a first draft to work with.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 19:30:57 GMT):<br/>
hey david, sounds great. Ill have a final English transcript to send them.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 20:35:34 GMT):<br/>
ok.  sounds good.
</p>

David, I do not have access to your YT.  If its possible to give me access, that would be great so I can get the English subtitles mastered on your channel.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 21:12:25 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 21:17:16 GMT):<br/>
ok.  good to check with them then.  probably much easier for roger to have direct access.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 21:17:28 GMT):<br/>
if possible yes
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 21:17:38 GMT):<br/>
so that as we get the translations i can easily upload the file
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 21:17:58 GMT):<br/>
that would work well then.  jess or helen should be able to help with access.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 21:18:24 GMT):<br/>
and roger, you may already be planning to do this, but is it possible to have the end screen be a link to the hyperledger.org/translate address?
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 21:19:27 GMT):<br/>
let me see what options we get for end screens.  i know you can add "other videos" you can click on.  not sure about outisde links.  but let me look
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 21:20:07 GMT):<br/>
ok, thanks
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 21:20:34 GMT):<br/>
You can add end screens to YouTube.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 21:20:45 GMT):<br/>
we can always put the link in the description, but clicking on the link as it appears at the end would be nice
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 21:21:27 GMT):<br/>
hmm, I think that's all stuff we can manage once the video is there
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 21:25:36 GMT):<br/>
yes.  i have to add the end screen with vid uploaded
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 21:47:25 GMT):<br/>
How about "Getting involved with Hyperledger: USING MINECRAFT"
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 21:47:43 GMT):<br/>
their are no bad ideas in brainstorming :)

have you considered longboats in England? Maybe Holland?

<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 21:54:00 GMT):<br/>
i'm sure my son liked a number of minecraft videos when using my computer while it was logged in to the hyperledger account
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 21:54:13 GMT):<br/>
he did add a number of hamster videos to the youtube channel once.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 21:54:24 GMT):<br/>
i can only imagine there are comments from hyperledger on minecraft videos somewhere...
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 21:54:36 GMT):<br/>
well, the value of those is not deniable

hey uh @Lumenphotovideo - personal question - do you have easy access to hamsters? I have a side project in mind
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 22:01:26 GMT):<br/>
Ry, im very intrigued by your hamster request, lol.  I don't personally have immediate access, but we can find some if needed.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 22:01:31 GMT):<br/>
what are you thinking?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 22:02:55 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 22:05:23 GMT):<br/>
who said hyledger doesn't do hollywood effects
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 22:05:35 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 22:05:45 GMT):<br/>
short boat, long boat, whatever u want
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 22:06:52 GMT):<br/>
I'm sure all of my boat stuff comes from Xyla Foxlin building a couple watercraft, then the guy with a name I can't pronounce building a scale model of a kayak to see if the design would work
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 22:07:05 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 22:16:33 GMT):<br/>
i get back from a dog walk to see this whole discussion took an interesting turn :)
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 22:56:57 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 22:56:58 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 22:57:24 GMT):<br/>
Ive gone through and adjusted the english subtitles.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 22:57:44 GMT):<br/>
Ill get those exported and sent out to our contributors for translations.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 22:57:56 GMT):<br/>
as they come in, ill get them uploaded.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 22:58:13 GMT):<br/>
The video is currently "unlisted" until you want to release
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Sat, 27 Feb 2021 00:25:15 GMT):<br/>
@Lumenphotovideo -- perfect.  i'll make the video public on monday
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Sat, 27 Feb 2021 00:25:29 GMT):<br/>
and we'll have a marketing push around it next week too
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Sat, 27 Feb 2021 16:14:47 GMT):<br/>
Exciting!!!
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Sat, 27 Feb 2021 16:15:07 GMT):<br/>
Next week let’s chat about the videos we have and how you all want them for the blog.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 14:55:05 GMT):<br/>
Morning, hope you all had a great weekend!
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 14:56:06 GMT):<br/>
just wanted to follow up to see what you all thought of for a description for YT.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 15:52:48 GMT):<br/>
@Lumenphotovideo -- morning.  i just took a pass at taking some text from pam's blog post about the translations and used that for a description.  i'm happy to edit or change it however we think is best.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 15:52:49 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 15:53:19 GMT):<br/>
and i made the video public and put it as the featured video on the hyperledger youtube channel main page.  we can leave it up there as the main video for the month of the campaign.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 15:53:41 GMT):<br/>
and we put a promo about the translations on the Participate page of the hyperledger site at https://www.hyperledger.org/participate
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 15:53:42 GMT):<br/>
looks great david
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 15:54:27 GMT):<br/>
where did we end up about having an end screen?  was that worth doing?  or does having the hyperledger.org/translate link in the description work fine?
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 16:02:30 GMT):<br/>
hey david, i will get on that here momentarily.  that slipped from me on friday.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 16:03:29 GMT):<br/>
no worries.  thanks for taking a look at it.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 16:03:43 GMT):<br/>
yeah, sorry for that slip!
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 16:20:31 GMT):<br/>
what is your twitter handle, @Lumenphotovideo ?
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 16:20:56 GMT):<br/>
hey ry, i do not partake in the twitter world :)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 16:21:04 GMT):<br/>
good call :)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 16:21:19 GMT):<br/>
what link should I use for you?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 16:21:59 GMT):<br/>
when I say "worked with lumen photo on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zlwjhtdp_7M get in contact (your link)" what is your link?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 16:24:21 GMT):<br/>
https://twitter.com/RyJones/status/1366423985638887425
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 16:36:35 GMT):<br/>
thanks for doing that!  im working getting my website up be end of month.  so it could be that or my email?

lumenphotovideo.com

roger@lumenphotovideo.com
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 16:38:56 GMT):<br/>
Sure thing
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 16:51:19 GMT):<br/>
thanks again for doing htaty
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 16:51:21 GMT):<br/>
that
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 16:59:20 GMT):<br/>
@Lumenphotovideo -- if it is helpful, we could put your website link in the youtube video description too at the end.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 17:12:26 GMT):<br/>
that would be awesome, thank you!
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 17:12:54 GMT):<br/>
that'll get me to wrap up the site quicker! haha.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 17:33:44 GMT):<br/>
:)
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 17:37:31 GMT):<br/>
ok, great.  as soon as your site is public, let me know and i'll add it to the video description.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 17:39:58 GMT):<br/>
sounds good, will do
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 17:40:56 GMT):<br/>

<br/><a href="./assets/7KMRfkv9t23tyATLg-1.png">1.png</a>
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 17:40:57 GMT):<br/>
in regards to links at end of video:

Apparently you have to be part of the YouTube partner program to be allowed to put up a clickable link to external site.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 17:41:28 GMT):<br/>
itlll let us add end cards on screen but will have to be other YT videos or the subscribe button
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 17:41:31 GMT):<br/>
one note on that.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 17:42:19 GMT):<br/>
the uploaded video file does not have any extra on screen time at the end.  so if we add an end card, it will go over the end graphic
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 17:43:06 GMT):<br/>
otherwise, the description box would be the only place to add link.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 17:48:10 GMT):<br/>
also, thumbnail was updated with Junjie's new photo
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 18:18:58 GMT):<br/>
ok, thanks for looking into it.  sounds like the link in the description will be fine
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Mon, 01 Mar 2021 18:19:15 GMT):<br/>
ok cool
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 19:05:12 GMT):<br/>
@Lumenphotovideo @pandrejko -- the blog post about the translation effort that includes the video is now live at https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2021/03/02/translating-hyperledger-fabric-documentation-into-multiple-languages
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 19:05:54 GMT):<br/>
@pandrejko -- let me know if you'd like to share this on the fabric channels or if you'd like me to.
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 19:06:14 GMT):<br/>
Do you mean the RocketChat channels?
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 19:11:26 GMT):<br/>
I posted on 2 internal IBM channels and asked about getting this published on external channels as well.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 19:11:40 GMT):<br/>
blog looks really good!
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 19:12:27 GMT):<br/>
This campaign is awesome!
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 19:17:57 GMT):<br/>
@pandrejko -- yes, whichever channels the fabric docs group uses would be good to share this out on.  wasn't sure how much people preferred chat channels vs lists.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 19:18:27 GMT):<br/>
thanks for sharing inside IBM as well and asking about publishing it on their external channels
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 19:18:36 GMT):<br/>
yeah -- it really came together well
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 19:18:41 GMT):<br/>
now let's see what happens :)
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 19:18:59 GMT):<br/>
will be really interested to see if new languages show up or if people join the existing groups
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 19:24:39 GMT):<br/>
I updated this page: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/fabric/International+groups too
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 19:40:16 GMT):<br/>
@pandrejko -- that's great.  thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Wed, 03 Mar 2021 20:52:42 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Wed, 03 Mar 2021 20:53:13 GMT):<br/>
swap out for each person
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Wed, 03 Mar 2021 20:53:24 GMT):<br/>
but could be another place we give contributors some love
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Wed, 03 Mar 2021 21:37:00 GMT):<br/>
@Lumenphotovideo -- the video and thumbnail look really good to me.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Wed, 03 Mar 2021 21:37:31 GMT):<br/>
once you have those, feel free to add to the youtube channel and i can reach out to each translation lead to get some text for the video description.  unless they've already provided text me can use for that?
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Wed, 03 Mar 2021 22:49:14 GMT):<br/>
Looks great Roger!
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 14:26:44 GMT):<br/>
hey guys, sorry I had to shutdown last part of yesterday to help my in laws.  Sounds great, glad you guys like the video.  Ill go ahead and get the others done and uploaded.

Do you want these vids added to the "Hoe to get involved" playlist?

Also, I will upload as unlisted until we get the title/descriptions.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 15:51:04 GMT):<br/>
@Lumenphotovideo -- yes, adding the videos to the same playlist as the main translation video makes sense.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:09:31 GMT):<br/>
ok cool. we'll want the title/descriptions up before adding them.   could we reach out to the translation leads to start working on those descriptions?

We need for Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 19:40:31 GMT):<br/>
Here's the Chinese blog video:

@Lumenphotovideo -- sure, i'll reach out to each of those languages and copy you and ask them to provide a translated description.
</p>

spanish is done as well, im just waiting on getting a good photo of Claudio.  his online ones arent good
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 16:41:31 GMT):<br/>
Happy Friday everyone!  End of the week update.  All blog videos are done and uploaded except for the spanish one which I need his photo to finish and export.  I have an email out to Claudio on that already.

Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, Malayalam and French languages have the english transcript and are working on their translations.  As those come in, I will get them uploaded to YT.

Looking ahead, if we get our transcripts back next week, we should be able to start wrapping out the project.

Is there any drive space anywhere you'd like me to upload all the final exported videos and thumbnails so you can have the actual files for future use?
</p>

@Lumenphotovideo -- thanks for the update.  i'll reach out today about getting video descriptions for those videos.  i didn't have a chance to send emails yesterday.
</p>
<p><strong>Lumenphotovideo</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 17:10:51 GMT):<br/>
ok cool, no worries.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 17:44:15 GMT):<br/>
@Lumenphotovideo -- i just emailed the Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish leads about getting translated text for their youtube videos.  i was thinking that in the title and description, perhaps we can include both the translated text and the English text?
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 17:44:30 GMT):<br/>
and i copied you on each email so you'll get the response from each of the leads
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 05 Mar 2021 17:52:30 GMT):<br/>
@Lumenphotovideo -- good news.  your video is working.  so far this week we've seen two people show up and say they're starting new translation efforts -- italian and persian

@Lumenphotovideo -- good to hear about the malayalam subtitles.  nice to see those coming in.

</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 08 Mar 2021 22:53:08 GMT):<br/>

@Lumenphotovideo -- we've been talking on our side about other contribution campaigns we want to run this year and for at least one of them we'd like a video similar to the translation one.  do you have availability coming up to work with us again?  if so, we can have a quick call to tell you more.  it would be like this one though -- interviews with a few different community members and putting that into context about why these projects are important and explaining how people can contribute.
