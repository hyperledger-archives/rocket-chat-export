{"msg":"Script:\n\nHyperledger is an open source project that was born from the combined desire and effort of various individuals, businesses, and organizations that were inspired to expand the usefulness of blockchain while developing an avenue for innovation within the community in the process. \n\nHyperledger and each of its associated tools have become a global resource because of its open source foundation...yet...there is one major roadblock that prevents the project from truly being as open and productive as intended. \n\nEnglish is the original language of the software...yet...80% of the world does not natively speak that language. So can something truly be considered open source if millions of potential users across the world are closed off by the barrier of language?\n\nIn 2019 , HL Fabric, spearheaded an initiative to translate all documents to as many languages as possible. In a short time, the HL community has already begun to grow and reap the rewards of opening up to all new regions. \n\nThe first wave of adopters translated Fabric documentation into Chinese.\n\n\n...China interview…\n\nThis quickly inspired a team of people in India to follow suit.\n\n...India interview…\n\nSince then, we’ve already added 6 more countries/languages to the Fabric family but we’re only just getting started. \n\n...third interview…\n\nBrain Behlendorph, the Executive Director of Hyperledger described the software as… “an open sourced community...of communities…” \n\nThere are countless people in your community right now that are only held back by the need for translation to the language you speak.\n\nSo we need your help to bridge that gap. \n\nIf you have the ability to translate english to your language, visit our translation page where we’ve laid out simple step by step instructions and resources to get you started. (EXPAND BUT WE NEED TO KNOW MORE FROM HL TEAM.)\n\n\nThis translation effort has already begun to open doors within several individual communities but Hyperledger is a living worldwide ecosystem and every new member can bring unique talents and ideas to the global community that benefits us all, as long as they have the ability to participate. \n\nThis is an invitation for you to be the person that makes that happen.","username":"Lumenphotovideo","ts":"2021-01-11T20:16:55.956Z"}

{"msg":"1. Why was it important to translate the Fabric documentation into your language?\n\nI have been studied blockchain technology since 2018 from Fabric. At that time, we don't have much more learning meterials but the official documents, partial documents are translated by the TWGC volunteers, but the Fabric is updated so quick that I have to read the English version, it is not easy for me at the beginning, and I believe that it is the same as many Chinese developers.Then I decided to make some cotributions for the community and began to translate the documents, so that other developers can learn the Fabric more easier.\n\n     2. What was the documentation translation experience like for you or your team?\n\nTranslating is a hard work, there would be at least two hours to translate one article for me, and some long articles may take more time, after that we also need another translator to review the translations before upload. Fabric official documents is really a big book and released frequently, we can't follow the latest version, we usually based on a fixed version such as v1.4.2,so sometimes we can also receives some complains from the reader. Fortunately, with the efforts of many volunteers, we have been finished the translations of v1.4.2, and the v2.2.0 is almost done, after that we will continuly update the translations followed by English version and fix the errors in the translations.\n\n     3. Can you give us an example of a benefit in having the doc translated into your language?\n\nThe process of translating is also the process of learning, I have been translated the documents since 2019 from 1.2 version to 2.0 version, I am very familar with the documents, though some Fabric features I never used in my work, I know the basic principles and usage, so I passed the CHFA exam and got the certificate easily. And also my contributions are approved by the community members, so I was elected as the chairman of TWGC in 2021 term.\n\n     4. Why is it important to you to recruit more people to help translate the documentation?\n\nMany of us are from Fabric open source community and dedicated to sharing and contributing all kinds of technical improvements and instructions. But indeed each individual's energy and professional competence are limitted, and as a result, many things aren't polished very well such that many translations may have a few errors and translation progress lags behind English document. Therefore, we hope more volunteers can take part in the translation work, but of course not only translations, you can try many other orientations as well. Here, you can find friends with common goal and contribute together.\n\n     5. How do you feel this effort has expanded the Fabric community?\n\nThe Chinese docouments translated by us helped many new Fabric developers, and many developers are asking Chinese document links in WeChat (Chinese social media app) group. Also contributors often make pull request in github for either correcting errors or applying translation tasks. In addition, TWGC releases seasonal contribution lists, one of which is the translation contribution list consisting of translators' name and organization. That greatly attracts some developers to contribute on behalf of their companies and many contributors are willing to show up as top 3 on the list.","username":"Lumenphotovideo","ts":"2021-01-29T14:33:17.853Z"}

I can ask our contributors if they can let me know if the timing is off, but Im feeling like that might not really make much of a difference.

Assuming everything is good to go, it will be ready to upload to HL's YouTube channel.  \n\nIm just waiting on some pics for the thumbnail, but what ill do is get it done today with whatever we have and as they come in, we can replace the thumbnail image.\n\n\nQuestion in regards to translations.  Our original idea was to have our contributors do the translations.  One thing I noticed is that some of them just used google translate or another software.  So that got me looking around at translation options and I found one that is really inexpensive and would have a quicker turn around than if we have contributors do it.\n\nI found a website called rev.com.  The process is super easy and within their site, they can not only translate but they will go ahead and put the translation on YT.  And all translations are time stamped to follow the video correctly.\n\nWe had talked about these languages as the ones we wanted to have translated.\n\nJapanese\nChinese\nPortuguese\nFrench\nRussian\nSpanish\nMalayalam\nTamil\n\nThey can translate all of these except for Malayalam and Tamil and would only cost $150 with a 24-48 hour turnaround.  \n\nWhat do you all think about using this service and then having a contributor do Malayalam and Tamil?","username":"Lumenphotovideo","ts":"2021-02-26T14:51:41.745Z"}
