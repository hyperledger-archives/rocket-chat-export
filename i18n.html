thank you all for joining the discussion today and i think there were some misunderstandings that need to clarified. I never really tried to decide anything for community. The translation team (people doing actual work) within technical working group china collectively decided to use github. I am not among those (shame on me), but merely forwarding the message. Main reason being: 1) hard to access 2) obscure file conversion 3) no commit sign-off
</p>
<p><strong>guoger</strong> (Thu, 09 Jan 2020 15:44:42 GMT):<br/>
i think we should respect what translators desire and try not to make decision for them, especially tool selection that affects them on daily/weekly basis
</p>
<p><strong>guoger</strong> (Thu, 09 Jan 2020 15:45:45 GMT):<br/>

Hi - I set up https://www.transifex.com/hyperledger/fabric-i18n/dashboard/ to work with the new repo https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-docs-i18n/ - how would you all like to move forward?
</p>
<p><strong>stone-ch</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 01:34:17 GMT):<br/>
We have tried transifex for a few months to translate Fabric documents last year, transifex is good website for translating, but it has some shortcomings make us not use it finally. First, it is too slow for us in China because of the network.Second, when transifex parse the documents, it always missing some marks of markdown syntax, such as " ```<some code>```, **<some text>** ", it always displays like "<some code>, <some text>",so we have to fix the format manually.

However, we decide to use github only to translate Chinese Fabric documents finally, but I think transifex is better for cooperating with multi language in different countries, and use github to store the po files.

<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 06:29:25 GMT):<br/>
I agree @stone-ch It seems that most other teams are both using language translations as the Chinese team is -- i.e. not using PO/POT and not using Transifex.  I think we need to follow your lead, and I think also gently guide new language teams to do the same as you.  It would be ideal if, over time, the CN repo could come in under the i18N repo that @rjones has created.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 07:07:20 GMT):<br/>
I set up transifex because it looked like it was in use for zh_CN already. Whatever workflow you like
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 07:10:33 GMT):<br/>
Sure, understood @rjones -- very reasonable, and it's still an option for teams that want to use it I guess.  I think it's probably OK that we have a light touch on its use -- a bit like building locally, or in RTD.  I do think it's more important that for consistency of structure all language teams use the same approach as the CN and BR teams -- that the language translation is a first class asset, and not somehow technically translated from English -- i.e. teams are not using PO/POT approach, and we should try to standardize on that -- as it will make the build the same for all languages.

</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 07:25:37 GMT):<br/>
I think we need the owners of CN and ML (Malayalam) to agree.  I cannot see it being an issue, but it's good form, obviously.  Maybe @stone-ch could raise it with the CN working group -- I can discuss with @aneenaalex -- I'm a  maintainer for ML, but we'd like Aneena and her team to be happy obviously.

</p>
<p><strong>stone-ch</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 08:53:24 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I agree @odowdaibm the the consistency of structure is more important. I think po/pot file is a very good format for translations, for example, if we want to translate the output logs of Fabric, we can use the translations in po files replace the text in print() function, and not need to modify the source code, because the po contains the line number of the source text. Transifex just like a tool to manage the po/pot files and simplified the translate workflow, we can change the po/pot management tool if we find a better one, and what need eventually is po/pot files.
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 08:58:44 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @stone-ch Very interesting and thank you.  I noticed though that the CN team didn't use PO/POTs, and neither did @renatost. This is tricky -- we really want to listen and follow what the translation teams suggest and practice rather than dictate, but we will all benefit from a single approach. At the moment that feels like not using PO/POT.  Clearly this is a tricky balancing act.  @renatost and you might want to discuss here. Right now, CN, BP and ML are our leading translations and if we can get these aligned then it will help all the other folks who are looking at translations right now -- and we have a lot of them (Spanish, French, Japanese...)

<p><strong>stone-ch</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 09:19:29 GMT):<br/>
Yes, we didn't use PO/POTs in CN team, mainly because I can't find a good tool to manage the files, now our method is use text editor replace the source text with Chinese translations directly, it's more simpler. It's just my suggestion that PO/POTs maybe a better format if we have a good tool. Sure, we should listen more suggestions of other teams.
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 09:32:07 GMT):<br/>
OK, super helpful @stone-ch thank you.  I think hen for now, if all the team are happy that we adopt the standard set by the CN teams.  I personally like it because it makes CN, PT and ML first class languages, and I think that will help the English documentation. For example, Renato has found some issues with English.  Now it does mean that we need to collaborate quite a lot, but I think that's OK.  Aneena said that she was fine working with source text like CN, so I think it might be easiest to make that our standard for now.

I personally like it because it makes CN, PT and ML first class languages, and I think that will help the English documentation. For example, Renato has found some issues with English and fixed them.  It does mean that we need to collaborate two ways, but I think that's OK.  Aneena said that she was fine working with source text as you do in CN, so I think it might be easiest to make that our standard for now.

<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 10:06:28 GMT):<br/>
Super -- that's a deal then.  @rjones we need to think about how we stage the repos coming across with the consent of the maintainers. If, as you suggest, they first get moved in under Fabric, then teams can move the content into i18n under the appropriate directory.  Renato has already populated Br_pt.  If @stone-ch can raise with the CN maintainers, then I can work with @Aneena and her team to communicate.

<p><strong>renatost</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 14:44:32 GMT):<br/>
@odowdaibm and @stone-ch -- Essentially I found two unwanted situations when using PO/POTs: - It requires extra processes in the creation and updating of the content, in the update it will be necessary to perform a more complicated process of differences checking . In the source code this is straightforward. -- POs do not transfer markdown formatting, thus the translation process becomes more difficult.
</p>
<p><strong>stone-ch</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 14:59:43 GMT):<br/>
Yes, if use PO/POTs we must have a tool to help us manage them. And use source code also has a problem, when the english documents updated we should check the differences and update the translations, now our method is use Idea(a java IDE) "Compare with Branch" to compare the files one by one to find the changes, @renatost do you have any better ways to check the differences?

@odowdaibm I'm having a bit of a hard time following this conversation, as most of the terminology is new to me. Is there an objection to folding the existing Labs repos into a single repo `fabric-docs-i18n` and if so, what are the concerns
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 16:53:07 GMT):<br/>
there isn't -- we've agreed on the structure of the docs. I think it will then be up to the CN team to populate.  I've been working with @renatost and @aneenaalex who are both happy that we do this.  So we're covered for Br-Pt and Malayalam in terms of populating.  Does that help @BrettLogan ?

<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 16:54:00 GMT):<br/>
I think we should let the teams populate i18n themselves -- the key thing is to have the doc builds being generated as you say.
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 16:54:12 GMT):<br/>
And right now, the teams don't need Transifex set up either
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 16:54:27 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for the clarification. If there is anything we as the maintainers can do to help, any of the projects should feel free to reach out to myself
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 16:54:54 GMT):<br/>
will do Brett -- On this week's doc WG calls we'll clarify, but Renato and Aneena are fully aware
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 16:55:02 GMT):<br/>
I will update the docs to make contribution clearer
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 16:55:12 GMT):<br/>
thx again for your much appreciated help
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 16:55:12 GMT):<br/>
I'll try to join this week, just need to make sure I highlight it on my calendar
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 16:55:20 GMT):<br/>
sure, and thx
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 16:58:14 GMT):<br/>
@odowdaibm take a look at this: https://github.com/ryjones/fabric-docs-i18n
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 16:58:51 GMT):<br/>
it preserves the history of both the repos under the labs
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 16:59:20 GMT):<br/>
I see it isn't perfect and I need to fix a few things
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 16:59:56 GMT):<br/>
Looking -- I think that having  a close mirror to fabric repo would be best
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:00:12 GMT):<br/>
I think this implies docs/source with langs under that? in locale?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:01:39 GMT):<br/>
I'm OK moving everything down a few directories if you like
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:02:31 GMT):<br/>
My goal was to preserve history of the existing repos
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:02:36 GMT):<br/>
I think that might help -- as it will mean all the instructions carry over
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:02:58 GMT):<br/>
(yes, I understand, and appreciate)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:03:10 GMT):<br/>
I see I missed the readme, which is still the thing
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:04:53 GMT):<br/>
I think having docs/source/locale/<lang> would be best -- it means if in the future we converge the English docs in, it will all fit into place
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:04:59 GMT):<br/>
would that be OK?
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:05:10 GMT):<br/>
I think ML does it this way
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:05:48 GMT):<br/>
I'm fine with it. Let me put something up
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:06:03 GMT):<br/>
Even if we have a shortened version of this:
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:06:05 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-docs-ml/tree/master/docs/source/locale/ml/LC_MESSAGES/commands
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:06:38 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-docs-ml/tree/master/docs/source/locale/ml/<file|directory>
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:07:01 GMT):<br/>
or https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-docs-ml/tree/master/docs/source/ml/<file|directory>
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:07:09 GMT):<br/>
does anyone have strong feelings about ml_IN, for instance? I know en_US and en_UK are different
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:07:13 GMT):<br/>
both would work well for now
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:07:34 GMT):<br/>
I don't know the 4 code for ML
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:07:38 GMT):<br/>
ISO 693 is ML
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:07:42 GMT):<br/>
it's ml_IN
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:07:48 GMT):<br/>
well perfect!
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:07:52 GMT):<br/>
ty!
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:08:12 GMT):<br/>
I noticed you were posting Pt_Br and I wanted to make sure we're on the same page
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:08:22 GMT):<br/>
you're 100% correct
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:08:27 GMT):<br/>
ty
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:08:32 GMT):<br/>
OK
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:09:26 GMT):<br/>
so https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/tree/master/docs/source/locale/[ml_IN|zh_CN...], right?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:09:26 GMT):<br/>
so https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric... /tree/master/docs/source/locale/[ml_IN|zh_CN...], right?
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:10:10 GMT):<br/>
yepper
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:10:20 GMT):<br/>
ty
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:13:37 GMT):<br/>
@odowdaibm take a look? https://github.com/ryjones/fabric-docs-i18n
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:14:57 GMT):<br/>
I think I need to adjust where ml_IN landed
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:21:32 GMT):<br/>
I moved the content of ml_IN up one: https://github.com/ryjones/fabric-docs-i18n/tree/master/docs/source/locale/ml_IN/
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:21:53 GMT):<br/>
that looks right
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:22:36 GMT):<br/>
Pt_Br can go in as a peer of that
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:22:52 GMT):<br/>
And it should be fine for the China team to do the same
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:23:15 GMT):<br/>
If we then build the site from that for the language options, it's just great
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:23:31 GMT):<br/>
this will be a marvellous step forward --ty so much
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:24:07 GMT):<br/>
Obv keep china docs coming from their repo build until they're happy to move everything across
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:24:14 GMT):<br/>
yes, if you go up one level, you'll see I brought everything over that way
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:24:35 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/pull/131 is pending for the move
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:24:57 GMT):<br/>
yes, that's cool - the CN team can bring their directories up
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:25:40 GMT):<br/>
it's easy for me to do before the move, if they could tell me what they want, let's do it?
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:32:07 GMT):<br/>
I think everything in this directory should be moved to the root except the source directory which should be removed
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:32:11 GMT):<br/>

<br/><a href="./assets/iBEKEr9L7SAB23vAt-Clipboard - June 17, 2020 6:32 PM">Clipboard - June 17, 2020 6:32 PM</a>
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:32:46 GMT):<br/>
or rather they should be in the docs folder
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:32:52 GMT):<br/>
with the README.md in the root
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:33:35 GMT):<br/>
yes, that's right, as the docs folder is currently empty
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:33:44 GMT):<br/>
makes sense I hope
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:34:24 GMT):<br/>
could we screen share in 20?
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:34:30 GMT):<br/>
sure
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:34:39 GMT):<br/>
ding when you're ready, and thanks
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:34:54 GMT):<br/>
OK. I updated the pt_BR PR to use the new format
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:37:51 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-docs-i18n/pull/2
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:43:59 GMT):<br/>
@renatost if you are OK with it I will merge
</p>
<p><strong>renatost</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:45:54 GMT):<br/>
I'm comfortable with that. TY.
</p>
<p><strong>renatost</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 18:11:12 GMT):<br/>
@rjones In the result of merge the docs directory is left inside the pt_BR structure. Can I remove it in my next PR or do you prefer to do it?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 18:29:42 GMT):<br/>
please restructure it how you like and file a PR
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 18:30:12 GMT):<br/>
probably move the contents of `/.gitignore` into your pt_BR area (and fix the path)
</p>
<p><strong>renatost</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 18:33:53 GMT):<br/>
no problem... I will tailor my files as required to follow the new structure.
</p>
<p><strong>renatost</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 19:01:10 GMT):<br/>
@odowdaibm - About the README files. I think that in the pt_BR directory Is better to left the README.md talking about brasilian translation project and we can move the README that we have inside the docs (talking about the build process) to locale dir and after that we can update to reflect the new process of build international language docs. What you think about?
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 19:02:02 GMT):<br/>
yes, exactly right
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 19:02:11 GMT):<br/>
the top level README should be generic
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 19:02:47 GMT):<br/>
and into each locale/<lang> we can include a language specific README.md
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 19:03:00 GMT):<br/>
Ry and I agree with you, so thanks for pointing it out
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 19:03:41 GMT):<br/>
thanks @renatost
</p>
<p><strong>renatost</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 19:04:49 GMT):<br/>
I don't have any tool to support that yet. From now that I'm incorporating my repo I need to start to think about that, my first idea was track the JIRA issues and than reflect in my repo but is only a idea. I will reflect about your process and if discover something new I will tell you.
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 19:06:00 GMT):<br/>
Have a think about this process.  @pandrejko and I discussed last week, and given all doc changes are tagged, it's an easy matter to find all PRS
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 19:06:34 GMT):<br/>
So I think tracking PRs tagged with doc might be easier @renatost
</p>
<p><strong>renatost</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 19:10:12 GMT):<br/>
I agree... we can try this.
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 19:24:46 GMT):<br/>
Right. Currency is really important and will be a challenge as the translators go through this process. The Fabric docs that they clone today will be different next week - as Renato knows.  A minimalist approach would be to query for all the doc PRs and examine the updates, but I expect that process may be cumbersome over time if there are _nn's_ of docs PRs to cull through. I'm trying to think how we can make this easier - by diffing the English versions of the files to see the changes that have been introduced or something like that. Just thinking off the top of my head.
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 19:25:21 GMT):<br/>
Maybe just focus on 1 committed release at a time.
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Wed, 17 Jun 2020 19:40:56 GMT):<br/>
that;s what we decided for ML for example Pam -- get 2.1 translated, and then it's just delta.  Tbh,I like your suggestion of diffs -- it's quite easy to do, and it all languages have the same structure it would be quite easy to see the ascope of the changes
</p>

I setup CI for the i18n repo. So it will now build the doc when PR's are opened
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 16:38:12 GMT):<br/>
@odowdaibm what happened is any open PRs, or any open issues, were deleted. :(
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 17:14:50 GMT):<br/>
@stone-ch howdy
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 17:15:35 GMT):<br/>
@stone-ch Do you want me to do the thing I showed previously, to bring over the lab repo?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 17:15:51 GMT):<br/>
If you want that, I can move the content to the new repo and archive the lab repo.
</p>
<p><strong>renatost</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 17:33:01 GMT):<br/>
My new PR had the CI failed. I believe that is because I made a change in the directory structure required to be aligned with the new definition. Could you check please?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 17:39:44 GMT):<br/>
@renatost It's not a required check, I disabled the required check until you finish reorganizing the directory and then I'll fix CI
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 17:39:44 GMT):<br/>
@renatost It's not a required check, I disabled the required check after I realized you were still reorganizing, until you finish reorganizing the directory and then I'll fix CI
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 17:39:52 GMT):<br/>
So if you are good, I will merge that PR
</p>
<p><strong>renatost</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 17:40:16 GMT):<br/>
Yes, please.
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 17:40:33 GMT):<br/>
Done
</p>
<p><strong>renatost</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 17:41:04 GMT):<br/>
Super!
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 17:41:26 GMT):<br/>
And I see the issue with CI, so I will fix that quick
</p>
<p><strong>renatost</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 17:41:45 GMT):<br/>
TY..

<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 18 Jun 2020 17:48:51 GMT):<br/>

@rjones  please open the issues of https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-docs-i18n, in https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-docs-cn we use issues managing who will translate which article. The translator can open an issue and leave a message indicated they want to translate the article, then the admin will assign the issue to him/her, avoiding another translator translate the same article.

Hello @yuki-kon  Welcome to the discussion and thanks for your collaboration on a Japanese translation!
</p>
<p><strong>yuki-kon</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 06:56:45 GMT):<br/>
@odowdaibm Thank you for great advice for documatation today! I'm very excited.
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 06:59:26 GMT):<br/>
Hello @BrettLogan @rjones -- Aneena and her team @aneenaalex  have been making excellent progress on a  ML translation.  Once we have a working build pipeline, it would be good to plug in the ML repo. The team have started to work using the same mechanism as CN and PTBR teams -- i.e. flat files rather than PO/POT.  This is very helpful, and much appreciated, so that all our languages work the same way.
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 07:01:47 GMT):<br/>
I also like the new directory structure -- but @renatost, I feel that we might be better off without the top level source directory.  i.e. *fabric-docs-i18n/docs/source/locale/pt_BR/source/* would become *fabric-docs-i18n/docs/locale/pt_BR/source/*
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 07:02:58 GMT):<br/>
I think it would be a good idea to change this now @rjones @BrettLogan so that we can make it as simple as possible.  I know it makes a small change required to CI pipeline, but it's worth it, I think.
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Fri, 19 Jun 2020 07:05:34 GMT):<br/>
Not a problem. I am going to disable CI checks for right now and once we are totally settled we can reenable them

@pandrejko I thought your guidance to first translate the Contributing guide was great, and obvious in hindsight, but I never would have thought of it
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Wed, 24 Jun 2020 15:22:51 GMT):<br/>
@BrettLogan Hi Brett. Renato tried to change the advanced configuration settings as you suggested (change the location of the requirements file) but the readthedocs does not seem to be recognizing his changes. Does he have the correct permissions to be able to do that?

</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Wed, 24 Jun 2020 15:30:11 GMT):<br/>
@pandrejko @renatost Let me fork Renato's repo and setup my readthedocs to use his and see what I can figure out
</p>
<p><strong>renatost</strong> (Wed, 24 Jun 2020 15:55:45 GMT):<br/>
Thanks...
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 15:59:01 GMT):<br/>
Renato, I am still working on this, I got everything set up yesterday and I am seeting the same issue you are, despite changing the location of the file, its not actually using that file. I may have to reach out to readthedocs support on this
</p>
<p><strong>renatost</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 16:25:31 GMT):<br/>
No problem. I will still working on the translation until we have this situation fixed.
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 17:58:59 GMT):<br/>
Sounds like we are close on i18n build maybe now Brett has it working on en_US?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:01:56 GMT):<br/>
Yea, I just need to open a support ticket with the ReadTheDoc team and figure out why it isn't honoring the config location when we explicitly override it in the UI
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:02:22 GMT):<br/>
great -- I will start to document what we have in the docs -- ty again Brett
</p>
<p><strong>renatost</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:04:32 GMT):<br/>
Hello everyone! I opened one pull request 3 days ago. Someone received some kind of notification about it? It is working fine?
</p>
<p><strong>renatost</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:05:30 GMT):<br/>
Just for know, I'm nobbie in this workflow.
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:05:42 GMT):<br/>
I'm happy to approve - let me do that now
</p>
<p><strong>renatost</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:06:00 GMT):<br/>
don't worry... I curious only... :)
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:06:17 GMT):<br/>
no worries, it's important we move this through
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:06:50 GMT):<br/>
I received the notification, but I assume I am not authorized to merge it
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:08:59 GMT):<br/>
You are Pam
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:09:17 GMT):<br/>
The Fabric-Doc-Mantainers were added as doc maintainers for this repo as well
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:10:08 GMT):<br/>
There are two layers of maintainers. The Fabric-Doc-Maintainers can approve for any language. And then each language has their own subset of maintainers who can also approve for their language only
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:10:10 GMT):<br/>
I'll add Pam and Joe to list
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:10:14 GMT):<br/>
yes they were
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:10:22 GMT):<br/>
I've just approved, and merged
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:10:42 GMT):<br/>
it should be in now @renatost
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:11:07 GMT):<br/>
OK. Good to know. Thanks Brett.
</p>
<p><strong>renatost</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:11:37 GMT):<br/>
Yes, thanks @odowdaibm !
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:11:40 GMT):<br/>
apols for being a bit slow @renatost  Always feel free to ping me,  Pam, Joe or me to move this through for you to
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:11:43 GMT):<br/>
Is it the same process where we add the doc-merge tag?
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:12:50 GMT):<br/>
I've added doc tag Pam, is there another?
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:13:39 GMT):<br/>
Normally, we add the doc-merge tag and then a bot comes through and does the actual merge.
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:14:00 GMT):<br/>
nice, seems like that;s not here yet
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:14:19 GMT):<br/>
That option wasn't available to me, so I suspect it needs to be applied
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:14:40 GMT):<br/>
for now, we can cope, as volumes relatively low, but it would be good to get aligned
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:14:48 GMT):<br/>
(or me to fix my ignorance, if I'm wrong!)
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:14:54 GMT):<br/>
I will add the mergify bot so you can use the `doc-merge` label
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:15:08 GMT):<br/>
superstar - ty Brett
</p>
<p><strong>renatost</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:18:05 GMT):<br/>
I'm not aware about this tagging process. Is this information would need to be in the contributing documentation?
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:18:26 GMT):<br/>
you read my mind -- I'm doing updates now and will add!
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:20:22 GMT):<br/>
@odowdaibm or @pandrejko , can you approve this: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-docs-i18n/pull/22
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:20:54 GMT):<br/>
Nevermind, one of the fabric maintainers got it
</p>
<p><strong>renatost</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:21:15 GMT):<br/>
:sunglasses: translation work are giving me new skills... lol...
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:21:53 GMT):<br/>
Thats all, the doc-merge label will work now
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:22:21 GMT):<br/>
Does the doc-merge label that we click Approve first?
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:22:21 GMT):<br/>
Does the doc-merge label require that we click Approve first?
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:22:27 GMT):<br/>
(I can't remember)
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:22:44 GMT):<br/>
When you add it, once the change is approved (and CI passes if its enabled) once a minute Mergify will come through and automerge any changes with that meet that crtieria
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:22:56 GMT):<br/>
Correct, you need to approve (and CI to pass when we enable it)
</p>
<p><strong>renatost</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:25:03 GMT):<br/>
@BrettLogan  Can I set this tag when I create the PR?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:25:20 GMT):<br/>
You can, and then once someone approves it, it will auto merge
</p>
<p><strong>renatost</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 18:25:54 GMT):<br/>
good... thanks
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 19:34:45 GMT):<br/>
I think it would be a best practice not to set the doc-merge tag until it is ready to merge - in case a reviewer has comments. Setting it in advance effectively means it only has to be approved by 1 reviewer. Maybe that is ok in this case, but it seems a little risky

我猜测这些文件是不是以前trasifix自动生成的那些？或者是transifix配置文件？

@odowdaibm @pandrejko what will the new Spanish code page be? https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/fabric/Spanish+Working+Group there are a lot of es_ pages
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 30 Jul 2020 16:03:03 GMT):<br/>
One option is to start with es_ES as Maria is from Spain.  I hope that won't offend our Latin American friends.  We could always just have es, and not specify country -- the language codes do allow this.
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 30 Jul 2020 16:03:38 GMT):<br/>
I think we should start with es_ES, and to all my Spanish-speaking friends reading this, I hope that's OK -- please say if it's not
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 Jul 2020 16:06:57 GMT):<br/>
We can start with es_(nothing) - I was trying to align directories with code pages so the RTD magic would work, but I don't have much opinion on it
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 Jul 2020 16:07:14 GMT):<br/>
I saw ru_RU already started
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 30 Jul 2020 16:07:18 GMT):<br/>
I'd prefer to start with es_ES
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 30 Jul 2020 16:07:20 GMT):<br/>
exactly
</p>
<p><strong>odowdaibm</strong> (Thu, 30 Jul 2020 16:08:01 GMT):<br/>
we can always change it later, but keeping it aligned with other 4-codes right now will keep other processes simplier
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 Jul 2020 16:08:40 GMT):<br/>
OK. They can create the subdirectory when they like.
</p>

Hello Brett @BrettLogan It would be good to get your thoughts on when we mght be able to try out a public RTD test build for one of our new i18n language directotries.  Say Renato's @renatost pr_BR translation?
</p>
<p><strong>renatost</strong> (Wed, 05 Aug 2020 17:15:18 GMT):<br/>
Hi @BrettLogan  could we try to make i18n build works? I looking forward to have our work public.

<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Fri, 07 Aug 2020 17:34:33 GMT):<br/>
sure... there were 18 commits. Too much in my opinion.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 07 Aug 2020 17:34:36 GMT):<br/>
there were several conflicts on CODEOWNERS, and a couple additions and deletions in other branches
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 07 Aug 2020 17:35:06 GMT):<br/>
yes, I usually do a `git rebase -i HEAD~(whatever)` and squash to one commit before I do a PR
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Fri, 07 Aug 2020 17:35:28 GMT):<br/>
Ok. Thanks. I'll do that before next PR
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 07 Aug 2020 17:36:34 GMT):<br/>
you can also just commit your changes in one subdirectory
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 07 Aug 2020 17:37:01 GMT):<br/>
basically, `git fetch origin (branch name)` `git rebase -i FETCH_HEAD`
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 07 Aug 2020 17:37:05 GMT):<br/>
something like that
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Fri, 07 Aug 2020 17:37:37 GMT):<br/>
Ok. If you think that should be best. I usually commit from the root of the project on.
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Fri, 07 Aug 2020 17:37:49 GMT):<br/>
But I can do that.
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Fri, 07 Aug 2020 17:37:58 GMT):<br/>
:thumbsup:
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 07 Aug 2020 17:38:05 GMT):<br/>
well, whatever your changes are should be applied to the head of the branch you want to commit to
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 07 Aug 2020 17:38:27 GMT):<br/>
if you have changes to /CODEOWNERS that's OK, but I see there has been a lot of needless editing of that file
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Fri, 07 Aug 2020 17:39:51 GMT):<br/>
That is weird. I only added one line to that file.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 07 Aug 2020 17:40:03 GMT):<br/>
yes, but others have edited it as well.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 07 Aug 2020 17:40:11 GMT):<br/>
(me) :)
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Fri, 07 Aug 2020 17:40:21 GMT):<br/>
hahaha... ok.
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Fri, 07 Aug 2020 17:41:00 GMT):<br/>

one question: what is the group policy about docker files?
I have dockerized the documentation build process.
Should I push that in a branch?
@pandrejko
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Tue, 11 Aug 2020 15:34:22 GMT):<br/>
Seems like that could be useful to other translators and doc writers. Would you be able to join our documentation workgroup call on Friday at 11am EST to show it? 

But to answer your question, I would want Ry and Brett to be OK with this before we merge it.
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Tue, 11 Aug 2020 15:34:54 GMT):<br/>
Sure. Totally.
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Tue, 11 Aug 2020 15:35:13 GMT):<br/>

@BrettLogan
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Tue, 11 Aug 2020 17:51:47 GMT):<br/>
I havent used with github actions. Only for local build.

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 11 Aug 2020 18:20:12 GMT):<br/>
OK. It might be better to use AZP - Brett?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 11 Aug 2020 20:36:53 GMT):<br/>
I'd be interested to see this, we are redoing the doc build process in fabric, which includes images for building the doc. They are hosted already at `hyperledger-fabric.jfrog.io/fabric-tox`
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 11 Aug 2020 20:38:07 GMT):<br/>
nice
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 12:01:22 GMT):<br/>
@BrettLogan @rjones Do either of you know what needs to happen for the CI/CD pipeline for the pt-BR docs?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 16:33:54 GMT):<br/>
I need to defer to Brett on this - I'm not sure what Fabric wants to do overall
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 17:11:10 GMT):<br/>
I got this working for zh_CN: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/release-2.2/
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 17:33:15 GMT):<br/>
OK. I have spent several hours on this last night and today, and I understand the problem better, so I am working to fix it.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 18:25:01 GMT):<br/>
@pandrejko hey look at this: https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/

Thank you @rjones You are a magician! What is the process to get the es content integrated?
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 18:42:18 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 18:47:10 GMT):<br/>
I understand the larger issue, though. It's a Zerg rush to build every language, when only one has a change.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 18:47:52 GMT):<br/>
the solution is to migrate from RTD, but that will be longer term
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 18:48:34 GMT):<br/>
something like fabric.hyperledger.org/docs should point to something we control, that isn't RTD.

@rjones I see the link for the es content now in the Fabric documentation, but it looks like there is no content behind it. Is there something else @claudiocebpaz needs to do so that the es content is visible?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 17 Aug 2020 12:44:21 GMT):<br/>
Yes. There aren’t a lot of pages translated
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Mon, 17 Aug 2020 15:36:32 GMT):<br/>
We havent push any translation yet. We have created the translation branch. 
And we we'll be transtating the first pages this week.
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Mon, 17 Aug 2020 15:43:16 GMT):<br/>
One thing is weird. I took the Portuguese branch and copied that. 
So It should show as Portuguese at the least.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 17 Aug 2020 16:13:52 GMT):<br/>
I'm not going to spend any time debugging anything until you have content to display, if that's ok with you? I spent a lot of time on this already and I'm not supposed to spend really, any time
</p>
<p><strong>stone-ch</strong> (Tue, 18 Aug 2020 00:47:50 GMT):<br/>
@claudiocebpaz  you can put the english  content in the translation branch first, then replace them with translations.
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Tue, 18 Aug 2020 01:04:08 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. That is what we have now. 
But I'll double check tomorrow for sure.

@claudiocebpaz I added the doc-merge label and it was merged - you should feel free to merge your own approved PRs

<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Fri, 21 Aug 2020 20:35:22 GMT):<br/>

(come from a wrong channel) @rjones  Hi Ry, for repos `fabric-docs-i18n` could it be configured to allow reviewer to squash commits before merge?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 23 Aug 2020 14:16:15 GMT):<br/>
Change the .github/settings.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>pandrejko</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 12:57:53 GMT):<br/>
@odowdaibm Anthony - If you speak to the translators on Friday it is probably worth mentioning about the doc-merge label that can be used by the doc translator maintainers to merge their own PRs. We should probably add that as well to our contributing guide.

@rjones  It has merged some Chinese translations, but RTD is not updated. It seems that the webhook is not triggered.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 03:01:04 GMT):<br/>
which branch? there might only be one published
</p>
<p><strong>stone-ch</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 03:05:28 GMT):<br/>
release-2.2
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 03:26:31 GMT):<br/>
I just rebuilt it - https://readthedocs.org/projects/fabric-documentation-chinese-translation/builds/11774543/  - try now?
</p>
<p><strong>stone-ch</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 04:08:58 GMT):<br/>
RTD is updated now.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 16:18:20 GMT):<br/>
I don't know why it failed to build, but the RTD status page showed it was failing
</p>
<p><strong>stone-ch</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 16:29:58 GMT):<br/>
release-2.2 Chinese translation build passed last time. Do you mean RTD cannot auto build?

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:25:28 GMT):<br/>
all I did was manually click the "build" button for 2.2 and it worked. I don't know what, if anything, changed
</p>
<p><strong>stone-ch</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:28:55 GMT):<br/>
yes i can also see the builds page, it fails sometimes because there are more than one build running at the same time, sometimes maybe there somethings wrong in the project
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:29:40 GMT):<br/>
I don't know. I know @BrettLogan is working to get us away from the RTD platform and it can't happen fast enough for me
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:31:34 GMT):<br/>
what is your rtd username?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:31:38 GMT):<br/>
stone-ch ?
</p>
<p><strong>stone-ch</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:31:51 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:32:18 GMT):<br/>
OK, you're now a maintainer :)
</p>
<p><strong>stone-ch</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:34:19 GMT):<br/>
the problem i met is auto compile when i update the translations in github, i don't think it is necessary to change a display platform.
</p>
<p><strong>stone-ch</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:34:30 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:34:54 GMT):<br/>
the issue is RTD is moving away from python 2.7, and the work to re-implement everything for Fabric is a lot.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:35:15 GMT):<br/>
as I understand it
</p>
<p><strong>stone-ch</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:39:36 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-docs-i18n/pull/88 do you mean the content talked about in this issue?

</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Mon, 07 Sep 2020 19:33:00 GMT):<br/>
Hello, @everybody. Is there a bot to copy a file to the i18n repo anytime a new file is added to the doc folder in the main repository?

This is an example: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/master/docs/source/secured_asset_transfer/secured_private_asset_transfer_tutorial.md
That file exists in the doc file in the primary repo, but not in the i18n repo.
It was probably added after we copied the folder into i18n.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 07 Sep 2020 19:49:01 GMT):<br/>
there is no bot.
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Mon, 07 Sep 2020 19:49:24 GMT):<br/>
Ok. Thanks. We'll do a manual review every now and then. Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Mon, 07 Sep 2020 20:01:31 GMT):<br/>
We could set up a nightly job to diff the trees of fabric and all of the translations and report and missing docs so teams could look at it 
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Mon, 07 Sep 2020 20:14:25 GMT):<br/>
That would be very helpful. Thanks, @BrettLogan

Hi,  I raised PR #181 for new lang translation,  Pls do review, Tq
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 20:29:54 GMT):<br/>
Hello, @rjones and @BrettLogan.
Last friday I was on the documentation workgroup, and I presented a problem. We'll need to have another "group" in the i-18n repo.

This is the scenario to solve: 
We are managing the collaborators' efforts in the Github repo using issues, milestones, and project.
But we cannot assign an issue to any user that isn't part of any GitHub group in the repo. 

Also, as maintainers, we'll like to have control over revision that these collaborators do. So we have a second verification before the pr is merged.

Right now, we only have one group for maintainers.

So, a big "i18n-collaborator" group for all translation seems the easiest way to go. 
We as maintainers could manage to add and delete members, so it's easier on other maintainers.

Makes Sense?
</p>

<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 20:33:28 GMT):<br/>
I think your issue is that they aren't part of the "Hyperledger" org. All maintainers have actually been assigned the maintainers role, which allows them to assign issues to people. But in order for people to be assigned issues, they first need to a part of the Hyperledger org on GitHub
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 20:34:01 GMT):<br/>
yes, exactly.
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 20:34:25 GMT):<br/>
So they should go to `github.com/hyperledger` and click the `Request to Join` button
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 20:34:41 GMT):<br/>
You wouldn't be able to add them to a team anyway until they've gone through this process
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 20:35:13 GMT):<br/>
And then Ry will get notified and accept them. We've discussed in the past coming up with some automation to handle adding new contributors, but we've never implemented it
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 20:36:06 GMT):<br/>
Ok. I could ask them to do so, no problem. 
What about having another group? I mean so they can request a pr, but not approve a pr?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 20:37:16 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "can request a pr," sorry?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 20:37:54 GMT):<br/>
You mean assign themselves to an issue?

I mean approve a request on the repo send by another contributor.
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 20:39:22 GMT):<br/>
But I think there is another way
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 20:39:38 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/teams/fabric-contributors
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 20:39:46 GMT):<br/>
we can add them to this group
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 20:40:04 GMT):<br/>
so the maintainers can assign to them an issue.
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 20:41:17 GMT):<br/>
Ok. we have ten extra contributors that want to help in the translation effort. 
I'll ask them to join the Hyperledger team in Github.
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 20:42:57 GMT):<br/>
Yea, that was the one I meant to point you too, apologies
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 20:43:35 GMT):<br/>

@claudiocebpaz we have a group for each language

Ok. Will do. Thanks.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 22:47:29 GMT):<br/>
Spanish
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 22:48:07 GMT):<br/>
The main idea is to separate moderators from collaborators. So before a PR is merge, moderators needs to approve the PR.

To have another manual review before the PR is merged.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 22:48:58 GMT):<br/>
have them add themselves here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/fabric/Spanish+Working+Group

Each PR requires a code review, so it should not be a problem
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 22:50:07 GMT):<br/>
since there is already a group for `-es` - I'd rather not have 500 groups and fine-grained ACLs
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 22:50:56 GMT):<br/>
This is the group: https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/teams/fabric-es-doc-maintainers/members
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 23:00:19 GMT):<br/>
Agree. 
I understand that each PR requires a code review. I would like to have another level of approval hierarchy.
The same way I can't approve a PR on the root directory, I would like an es-maintainer to review what a contributor is doing on the "es" directory.
</p>
<p><strong>claudiocebpaz</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 23:00:35 GMT):<br/>
I think we can make it work this way. Thanks!

Hello everyone! The DCI Working Group will be having our last meeting of the year this Friday and we'd really love to see you all there. We'll be discussing/finalizing 2021 plans so it's a great time to get plugged in. https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/DCI/Diversity%2C+Civility%2C+and+Inclusion+WG+Home
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 19:04:56 GMT):<br/>
Thanks to everyone's hard work over this past year to translate the Fabric documentation in eight different languages.  We’d like to showcase the work you've done as well as invite new people to join your translation groups and encourage translations of additional languages.  To do that, we could use your help creating a video about the translation community. 

Could you please identify someone in your group who would be interested in appearing in a video we are putting together?  This person would speak in your native language about the translation work you've done.  Could you please also identify someone in your group who would be willing to coordinate with our video production team in English about this project?

When you've picked the people from your translation group for those roles, please send that information to Pam Andrejko (pama@ibm.com).  Once we have these names from you we'll follow up with more details.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Thu, 17 Dec 2020 16:11:49 GMT):<br/>
Hyperledger published an annual report today and it has a section called 'Hyperledger in Multiple Languages' that provides a nice summary of everything that the group in #i18n and that the translation groups have done this to provide information to people about Hyperledger in a range of different languages.  I thought people here would be interested in checking that out at: https://www.hyperledger.org/learn/publications/hyperledger-annual-report-2020

@stone-ch thank you for sharing about the meetups and webinars that TWGC hosted last year.  it would be great for us to help share out what is happening there and include them more in our reports, website and social media.  i don't have a lot of visibility into what is going on and i think that is also true with jess who put that report together.  would it be possible for the TWGC to share regular updates so we'll have this information.  or we can look at including details where we are tracking other webinar and meetup activities (i'll add some links below).  i'll be happy to work with you to figure out the best way to coordinate around the TWGC's activities.
</p>

Hello guys! This is my first PR of the French translation(https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-docs-i18n/pull/362).
All automated tests are green. 
So my question is: how long does it take to the PR to be reviewed and eventually merged? (I am pretty excited as you can imagine ;) cc @rjones @davidwboswell

<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Tue, 16 Feb 2021 19:47:59 GMT):<br/>
So, all you need to do is create a `fabric-docs-fr-fr` project on readthedocs.org under the hyperledger org and then add it as a translation here: https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/hyperledger-fabric/translations/

Hi @rjones , I'm here now

<p><strong>aakzubaidi</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 20:34:17 GMT):<br/>
Hi, I have got some people who express their willingness to participate with me in translation to Arabic. Now, I am just wondering whether there is any open source locale or translation management systems that you recommend out of your experience such that these system enable collaboration, versioning, progress, common terms/glossary and and shows what everyone has contributed and provides with the ability to manage translations, track changes, review and so on.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 21:00:06 GMT):<br/>
@aakzubaidi some projects use [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com), but I have no personal experience with it
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 22:28:07 GMT):<br/>
@aakzubaidi -- if you have recommendations for tools we should be looking into, feel free to make suggestions.  seeing what other open source projects use could give us some good ideas to consider.  i'm most familiar with mozilla's translation effort and they use a tool called pontoon.  https://pontoon.mozilla.org/
</p>
<p><strong>aakzubaidi</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 23:33:17 GMT):<br/>

Hi - the Arabic translation is running into some turbulence around tooling, specifically, how to help contributors without a lot of GitHub experience. Does anyone have any tooling or process they would be willing to share?
</p>
<p><strong>aakzubaidi</strong> (Thu, 18 Mar 2021 20:25:32 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @rjones for raising this.  Any thoughts or shared experience will really helps advancing out effort. To put in context, here is a little story. we have managed to build a small team of translators (it is now 4 of us with different level of commitment based on how everyone is available). The group already started translating basic Fabric documents such as WhatIS, Contribution Welcome, and so on . However, we are currently figuring out how to collaborate according to the best practice, and what the right tools to adopt for that. Most of the team lack essential knowledge of Github, ReadtheDocs, Visual Code studio, MD and RST format, and the like. Currently, I suggested them to translate as they can using Google Docs, while we prepare a set of workshops to introduce them to all they need to know on that regard. So, we have an upcoming session for the group to learn how to set Vscode, and how install required tools for ReadTheDocs. Also, We will introduce them to MD and RST markup syntax. So, this is a slow process, but hopefully we eventually see the light through.
</p>
<p><strong>aakzubaidi</strong> (Thu, 18 Mar 2021 20:29:43 GMT):<br/>
Also any suggestion on Right-To-Left RTL issues?
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Thu, 18 Mar 2021 21:35:46 GMT):<br/>
@aakzubaidi -- if you don't get a response to your question here, i can connect with the leads from the other active translation efforts and you can try discussing things that way.  some of those people may not regularly check this channel.

@here I would like to ask how we could get a mutual support forum going? I know @ricba needs some assistance on getting the GitHub workflow going, and the Chinese and Japanese teams have fairly well developed workflows
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 23 Mar 2021 13:54:22 GMT):<br/>
I want to help the new translations get rolling, but I really can't do a lot of handholding when it comes to using Git and the like
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 23 Mar 2021 15:08:12 GMT):<br/>
one thought -- would an i18n or translation mailing list be helpful?  that might be a more effective way for people to communicate?  for instance, i just see 4 people in this group online right now so if someone asks a question many people involved in translations wouldn't be on right now to answer and may miss the question.
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/i18n?msg=sEwFKsDTpsy8x6gdR) Thanks Ry, I will try this way in Chinese group, and give you a response a few days later.

<p><strong>stone-ch</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 02:26:13 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/i18n?msg=F88d3zm63wijJ4LHa) Pontoon seem be similar with transfix, it makes the translating easier. We have tried transfix about two months, but the website is too slow in China, and the translations downloaded always in bad formats, so we decided to use github back again.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 13:43:51 GMT):<br/>
Ok. I really want to support new translations like Italian but I don’t have the time
</p>
<p><strong>davidkhala</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 13:56:32 GMT):<br/>
@rjones Hi, Ry, we see odd behavior in Github PR https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-docs-i18n/pull/387 and wonder if the `enabled auto-merge`  is the bug cause of it. The behavior is: this commit authors are `wuqiaoming` and `ZJJ` intially, but after merged, it become you and `ZJJ`.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 13:57:07 GMT):<br/>
That is strange
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 13:57:22 GMT):<br/>
I will not use auto merge

@tonybka -- there are 600 people in the two meetup groups in vietnam.  there are a couple options for contacting them.  if you wanted to write a note in vietnamese about the translation effort, i can send that out to all of those people.  or we could organize a virtual meetup where we invite everyone in the groups to join and you could present about the translation effort -- people working on translating other languages have done that and it worked well.  for reference, the two groups are at: https://www.meetup.com/Hyperledger-Hanoi/ and https://www.meetup.com/Hyperledger-Ho-Chi-Minh-City/
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Thu, 15 Jul 2021 14:39:53 GMT):<br/>
let me know what you prefer -- and we could do both too if you'd like
</p>
<p><strong>tonybka</strong> (Sun, 18 Jul 2021 13:29:54 GMT):<br/>
What a coincidence. Actually, I was in the cover picture of Hyperledger Hanoi Meetup group. I and Co-organizer (David Tran) know each other. Let me contact him in person to discuss about this
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 19 Jul 2021 14:49:13 GMT):<br/>
@tonybka -- that's great.  cool to know you're in that photo :). let me know what you and david decide and i'll be happy to help.  those groups haven't been that active lately so it would be great to do a virtual event to showcase what is going on in the community in vietnam.

Thank you! I am interested in translation for Korean. But It seems that the links used in fabric docs have been broken. so I reported an issue(https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/issues/2920) and made a pull request (https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/2921) for that.
</p>
<p><strong>justiny</strong> (Wed, 15 Sep 2021 07:22:08 GMT):<br/>

@justiny -- i'm glad to hear you're interested in a translation for korean.  that would be really helpful to have more content in korean.  you may already know this, but we have an active community in korea and they'd welcome more content.  if you'd be interested in connecting with community members there to invite more people to help with translating, let me know and i'm happy to help.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Wed, 15 Sep 2021 16:50:46 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Thu, 16 Sep 2021 17:23:21 GMT):<br/>
