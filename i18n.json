{"msg":"Yes, I agree @odowdaibm the the consistency of structure is more important. I think po/pot file is a very good format for translations, for example, if we want to translate the output logs of Fabric, we can use the translations in po files replace the text in print() function, and not need to modify the source code, because the po contains the line number of the source text. Transifex just like a tool to manage the po/pot files and simplified the translate workflow, we can change the po/pot management tool if we find a better one, and what need eventually is po/pot files.","username":"stone-ch","ts":"2020-06-17T08:53:24.589Z"}

At the moment that feels like not using PO/POT.  Clearly this is a tricky balancing act.  @renatost and you might want to discuss here. Right now, CN, BP and ML are our leading translations and if we can get these aligned then it will help all the other folks who are looking at translations right now -- and we have a lot of them (Spanish, French, Japanese...)","username":"odowdaibm","ts":"2020-06-17T08:58:44.549Z"}

{"msg":"Hi - the Arabic translation is running into some turbulence around tooling, specifically, how to help contributors without a lot of GitHub experience. Does anyone have any tooling or process they would be willing to share?","username":"rjones","ts":"2021-03-18T18:05:54.069Z"}
{"msg":"Thanks @rjones for raising this.  Any thoughts or shared experience will really helps advancing out effort. To put in context, here is a little story. we have managed to build a small team of translators (it is now 4 of us with different level of commitment based on how everyone is available). The group already started translating basic Fabric documents such as WhatIS, Contribution Welcome, and so on . However, we are currently figuring out how to collaborate according to the best practice, and what the right tools to adopt for that. Most of the team lack essential knowledge of Github, ReadtheDocs, Visual Code studio, MD and RST format, and the like. Currently, I suggested them to translate as they can using Google Docs, while we prepare a set of workshops to introduce them to all they need to know on that regard. So, we have an upcoming session for the group to learn how to set Vscode, and how install required tools for ReadTheDocs. Also, We will introduce them to MD and RST markup syntax. So, this is a slow process, but hopefully we eventually see the light through.","username":"aakzubaidi","ts":"2021-03-18T20:25:32.085Z"}
