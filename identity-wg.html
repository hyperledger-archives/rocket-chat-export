Regarding one of the agenda items we are pretty open for identifiers in sawtooth lake. We had been using bitcoin style addresses. I've recently put up a PR that would just hash a public key to produce a 32 bit ID. But I don't have any real strong feelings there (besides a mild dislike for base58). 
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 08 Feb 2017 16:07:33 GMT):<br/>
Drummond and I also have a conflict, but Daniel Hardman from Sovrin should be able to join.  Here is a reference to the cross-ledger decentralized ID spec that is being discussed with the folks at Sovrin, uPort, Blockstream and Blockstack (and others) https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z-9jX4PEWtyRFD5fEyyzEnWK_0ir0no1JJLuRu8O9Gs/edit?usp=sharing

Extending a little on Dan's comment... STL uses ecdsa keys (encoded like bitcoin addresses) for infrastructure identifiers. However, each transaction family can map those into more expressive/meaningful identifiers... for example, in the endpoint registry, we map the ecdsa identifier into a proof of binding for a separate, enclave-specific private key. the proof is created by the enclave using the Intel Attestation Service. In the marketplace, there is a notion of "participant" which maps the ecdsa identifier into another structure that provides more market-place information about the identity... so... like most things in STL, identities are pluggable

Hi @all: Status of Identity WG 02/16/2017,
•	The Identity WG charter was approved by the TSC
•	Work has started on the Identity WG document covering the interface
•	The Architecture WG started addressing the identity of nodes participating in consensus and validation.
•	As part of this, Binh presented the Fabric membership services to the Architecture WG
•	Similar presentations or documents are expected from Iroha and Saw Tooth Lake
•	The Identity WG in collaboration with the Architecture WG will strive to keep the interfaces to other types of Identity(transactors), as well as that of the nodes mentioned above consistent. 
•	Identity, cross chain, legacy and from other trust anchors (public permissionless) started to be addressed by debating pathways to canonical transformations (from DID->DDO as well as X.509/X.500) to DLTs under the Hyperledger Umbrella.
•	Collaboration has started with SOVRIN to see how they can fit in with the Hyperledger Umbrella as well as how they can contribute to the ongoing work on Identity.  
Comments/questions welcome.
Vipin

Message from @dselman  regarding identity implementation in fabric composer "Composer manages participants and identities. Participants represent the people/orgs that are members of a business network. They are modelled and can be complex data structures, with relationships to other assets or participants. An identity is issued/revoked for a participant, and the identity <--> participant mapping is stored in world state by Composer. A single participant may have multiple identities. An identity is related to a single participant. The identity is stored in an ECert as an encrypted attribute, so that when a transaction is submitted Composer can retrieve the identity and through the identity-participant mapping table retrieve the associated participant. Docs: https://fabric-composer.github.io/tasks/identity-issue.html https://fabric-composer.github.io/tasks/identity-revoke.html . The current participant is the basis for access control: https://fabric-composer.github.io/tasks/current-participant.html Composer also supports declarative access control: https://fabric-composer.github.io/reference/acl_language.html

Thanks for reposting, Vipin. We'd love to get feedback. Also, for anyone who is interested, the Sovrin Foundation Board of Trustees also just approved the Sovrin Provisional Trust Framework. It has 12 pages of definitions describing the Sovrin identity model. See this announcement on the Sovrin Forum: http://forum.sovrin.org/t/sovrin-provisional-trust-framework-approved-22-march-2017/221

Agenda:
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 05 Apr 2017 14:17:49 GMT):<br/>
1.Standards: Normative/Prescriptive vs Descriptive where do you draw the line? How does this relate to the Identity WG
2.Work on the Interface/Whitepaper Document for Identity- how to proceed? There have been suggestions made: start with Interfaces/Capabilities from Indy/Fabric/STL/Iroha- we need volunteers
3.How to Interoperate? Is this important in the first place?
4.Splitting the Identity space framework vs. Transactors

Hi, everybody. I like to introduce ourselves. We're Belgian based company, that works on identity. In our current stack we use hyperledger fabric. At this moment we did some POC on this platform. Now we're reaching the point to get funded and to start building our mvp. I followed the identity-WG some time. by reading the communication and passing documents. Now that their is a go, We want to more involved into the working group. Also with the formal contribution of sovrin platform.

@here Identity WG Call April 19, 2016 at 12 EDT. Details in wiki link https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/identity/identity-wg.

Proposed Agenda:

Welcome new comers into the group and get reasons for participation.
Work on short term goals, identify volunteers for the following items in the paper and a timeline (we will aim for a draft of some of these items by Monday the 24th to continue work at the hackfest)
a.	Current Interfaces: Description of Indy, Fabric, Iroha, Monax, STL.
b.	Extract the common elements from these interfaces to describe an “ideal” Identity Interface
c.	Read the Requirements WG paper and map to Identity requirements
d.	Description of CA vs DiD- i.e. Central Authority vs Distributed Identity and their interoperation and how Identity component will operate in the context of Legacy systems and heterogeneous DLTs.
e.	Read and get data from Architecture Working Group on Identity to incorporate or link to in our paper

Tentative Volunteers from what I remember are: Jan Kamenisch, Nathan George, Drummond Reed, Sean Bohan, Daniela Merella
If there are any I am forgetting, please speak up if you are on the call.
I will cross post this on tsc chat and architecture wg chat as well as the technical-discuss and tsc mailing lists.
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 19 Apr 2017 04:29:13 GMT):<br/>
Vipin, I'm in Paris for Rebooting the Web of Trust #4 this week, but the day should be wrapped by the time of the call so I'm still planning on attending. Also, Nathan and Sean and I will all be attending the Hackfest in DC next week with a specific goal of working on the Identity Architecture paper that the Architecture WG wants do to (I wasn't on their call but Nathan was). One thing that might be good on today's agenda is to learn more about what the goals of that paper are and how it will related to the Identity WG white paper.

I joined the call this week and will be at the Hackfest in DC next week in the morning on Monday and the day on Tuesday.  I look forward to getting more involved with the project and hope that we can incorporate some of the concepts of cyber security into the advanced capabilities of blockchain based attributes.  The global installed base of trusted computing is where the keys can be made safe for a blockchain based attribute store and assure the quality of registered devices and the users they represent. Some of the hard problems like interpreted attributes with privacy can finally be addressed with the addition of strong device identity and verification of capabilities using attestation. I look forward to meeting folks and discussing how we can contribute to the process.

1. Enterprise-managed Identity vs Self Sovereignity 
TEEs (HSM etc) and Identity -
Each incubated solution will contribute their writeup on Identity viz. Indy: Evernym guys, STL: Maintainers (have a writeup on End Point Registry), Fabric - CA have a link, plus there is a deep dive session duringthe hackfest; Iroha, I have a link from Makoto; Monax Burrow, you could help with this part or if you can point me to any document that you have.
 General survey of other publicly known solutions (Corda, Ethereum, Ripple, etc.)
Interoperability of Identity - we do not have a volunteer for this yet.

per @dhuseby observations on linkability during @drummondreed and Mason discussing Sovrin... The EPID protocol provides mechanisms for unlinkable quotes. It doesn't address if you need to establish a permanent identity with a single organization that requests identifiable attributes (e.g. your age + address + etc), but it does resist multiple organizations colluding to link separately shared attributes e.g (age) + (address) + (etc) and correlate an identity.

@dhuseby the protocol uses a random blinding term on each interaction. That term can be consistent for a single organization if you need a persistent identifier there, but still be different for other organizations in a cryptographically unlinkable way.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 25 Apr 2017 00:58:23 GMT):<br/>
Now as you observed in our side bar if other components of your system are bleeding identity information like your IP address etc. ... well that's outside what the protocol can control.

Vipin: As Sean mentions, today is the second day of Internet Identity Workshop in Mountain View, and the interest about DIDs, DDOs, and DKMS (Decentralized Key Management System) is INTENSE. We (the Sovrin and uPort) identity teams have been asked to give sessions about them today and tomorrow, and in order to schedule those, we have to attend the opening circle which begins at—you guessed it—9AM PT.

@JonathanLevi No, unfortunately we're not really set up to record full sessions at IIW (occasionally we plan ahead and do it for certain special sessions). BUT there are notes taken and posted for as close to 100% of the sessions as possible (the community is pretty religious about that). As they come in, all the notes will be visible at http://iiw.idcommons.net/IIW_24_Session_Notes. Just look for the sessions on DIDs and DKMS on Wednesday May 3.

<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 21:09:02 GMT):<br/>
Vipin, I have those sections on my list. I'm at European Identity Conference in Munich this week, but I fly back to the States on Saturday and plan to work on those sections this weekend and have a draft ready by next Monday (before One World Identity K(NO)W Identity Conference starts in DC).
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 22:46:41 GMT):<br/>
is there work on how to add biometrics onto the general id effort?
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 22:46:54 GMT):<br/>
we have a few things we are working on that could be leveraged
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 13:37:33 GMT):<br/>
@berserkr glad to hear, we can work this into the list. However, there is a lot of feeling against this as this is a "nuclear option"; it might be that we may have to depend on self-sovereign disclosure of such schemes through attestations available through public Identity utilities such as Sovrin. We have a big tent and can benefit from your views on how such schemes can be implemented safely. Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 13:39:23 GMT):<br/>
@drummondreed looks like you are a true road(air) warrior. Hopefully your biological clock adjusts fast. Eager to see sections, let us start and share even rough drafts.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 13:39:56 GMT):<br/>
Will try to be on architecture WG call today.
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 21:56:41 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB I'm trying to cover the ground at what amounts to seven identity conferences in a row (not counting Cloud Identity Summit in late June). It is what it is—the word of Sovrin must be spread across the land ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 21:57:39 GMT):<br/>
I am happy to share drafts as fast as I can get them written, but given the level of interest in blockchain identity in general and Sovrin in particular here at EIC, it's near certain I won't get to do much more drafting until my flight to DC on Saturday.

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 15:12:01 GMT):<br/>
@drummondreed happy to see that Sovrin has such an evangelist. I have some more interested parties contacting me to contribute. we can collaborate on having them do some of the drafting and you to oversee the correctness, the language and quality of the output for some of the topics you picked. How does that sound?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 13:04:58 GMT):<br/>
@here ,

Since our collaboration and hence interaction has increased with work on the Identity WG Paper and other work products, we have established a mailing list for Identity WG (Thank you Tracy) which is open to all. Please subscribe. We aim to avoid cross-posting to other mailing lists for continued work on Identity WG related matters. Meeting announcements and other general announcements will continue to be relayed though cross posts as we need to get the word out to as many interested people as possible.

Thanks,
Vipin

The new mailing list is at   https://lists.hyperledger.org/mailman/listinfo/hyperledger-identity-wg it is open for subscription.

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 15:43:19 GMT):<br/>
hi @VipinB of that list of volunteers which is the topic for today?
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 16:24:32 GMT):<br/>
My understanding is that this is the list of contributors to the Identity WG white paper
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 16:44:02 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB I can start looking at biometrics use in the blockchain, how it is being used, still need to understand it from a DID-like concept but could contribute there, lmk if that would be a good section to add
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:00:15 GMT):<br/>
That would be fantastic. Biometrics and DIDs are going to be a very hot topic.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:10:55 GMT):<br/>
@Dan we usually range over the topics in the call. 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:11:29 GMT):<br/>
It ran from TEEs to SPKI
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:12:34 GMT):<br/>
But I did get some firm commitments from volunteers to work on their sections. Sanjay Bakshi from Intel was on the call and offered to help with STL EPR as well as TEEs
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:15:03 GMT):<br/>
@berserkr We could open up a section on biometrics, since that is another hot topic, seems like we have views on both extremities of the spectrum re:biometrics
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:15:05 GMT):<br/>
@drummondreed agreed :)
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:15:22 GMT):<br/>
yes agreed
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:15:31 GMT):<br/>
there are camps that say no biometrics on bc
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:15:34 GMT):<br/>
some say yes
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:15:39 GMT):<br/>
there are many ways of doing it
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:15:46 GMT):<br/>
for instance, the way hyper does it
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:15:49 GMT):<br/>
through the use of tokens
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:15:52 GMT):<br/>
hypr I mean
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:16:08 GMT):<br/>
sign me up for that, I can contribute 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:16:33 GMT):<br/>
If you write up a short section and send it to the list we can iterate and include in paper
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:16:53 GMT):<br/>
alright, what is the timeline so I can arrange my time 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:17:43 GMT):<br/>
You do not have to write the most comprehensive thing; iteration usually solves most of the problems; it is up to you to propose a timeline...since this is a purely volunteer effort
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:18:00 GMT):<br/>
alright, sounds good
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:18:31 GMT):<br/>
Make it as short a timeline as you can for the first output of about 200-400 words
</p>
<p><strong>berserkr</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:18:45 GMT):<br/>
yeah, should send it by Friday
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:18:50 GMT):<br/>
Great
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 17 May 2017 17:19:31 GMT):<br/>
I heard that some folks would have some sections in by Consensus time; of course it will need iteration and polishing up

@here Agenda for tomorrow's meeting

@JonathanLevi will present his winning entry in Consensus 2017 Ethereum hackfest which pivots on Identity to reveal, hide and mask results with proof on multiple blockchains. This is state of the art. This uses Identity to great effect. 

Also we continue the discussion on the work for the Identity WG paper.
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 06:45:02 GMT):<br/>
Vipin, excellent, I'm really looking forward to Jonathan's presentation—I got a preview at Consensus and it's really cool.
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 06:47:34 GMT):<br/>
Also, I finally added some of the DID/DDO content I've been promising to the white paper. I didn't know where to put it so I added it at the end (after the contributions from Jan Camenisch and Steven Sprague). The link to the section I added is https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ExFNRx-yYoS8FnDIUX1_0UBMha9TvQkfts2kVnDc4KE/edit#heading=h.uqg8acshhteb
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 06:47:38 GMT):<br/>
If we have time on the call tomorrow we can discuss how to proceed with overall organization of the white paper.

@hugotoledo not for Identity WG but we have a separate Whitepaper WG

@JonathanLevi  let me express my thanks for bringing forward a few key points during your presentation
1. How you were able to hook together Private/Public Hyperledger/EEA/Ethereum public etc. on Azure modifying a few of the publicly available samples/interfaces and use cases
2. The imperative for us all to collaborate and interoperate
3. We hope to absorb some of this spirit into our whitepaper and our implementation
4. We can help you with your blog and approach it with a workflow perspective instead of us being absorbed in the differences in the Blockchain implementations both within hyperledger and outside.

1. How you were able to hook together Private/Public Hyperledger/EEA Quorum/Ethereum/Indy/Sovrin  etc. on Azure modifying a few of the publicly available samples/interfaces and use cases in an interesting way
2. The imperative for us all to collaborate and interoperate
3. We hope to absorb some of this spirit into our whitepaper and our implementation
4. We can help you with your blog and approach our own White/Yellow paper like you did with a workflow perspective instead of us being absorbed in the differences in the Blockchain implementations both within hyperledger and outside.

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:23:29 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I may take you guys up on item 4. It would be very helpful indeed, if you guys can spend some cycles and helping me write this up. I have all the code, etc... I, too, believe that it will be useful !

<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 17:24:26 GMT):<br/>
I can put together a baseline/draft.... detailing the workflow in details, etc.

Question from ReqWG:  There are several use cases (being drafted), in which the mandate for the smart contract of one identity needs to be changed after-the-fact, even if the smart contract itself does not need to be executed (debtors, dementia, death, probate). Is the identity-wg already covering these use cases?

@drummondreed Is this identity use case in your sweet spot. ReqWG is meeting next Monday 6/12 at 10am pst to discuss.... https://docs.google.com/document/d/1psJc9UWuteSzOqIG0VLIdzdlxFb9kq-Csw-dxcjPzEo/edit

@cliveb Sorry I dropped the ball on getting back to you. Yes, the use case is in the DID sweet spot, and yes, 10AM PT happens to be the ONE slot I have available on Monday. I will plan to be on the call.

@here Maybe we should setup a debate about biometrics. There are some people who are completely opposed to biometric collection and use on principle and also because they fear the data can be compromised or stolen, since there is no revocation of biometric data, this can be a problem... Also are there spoofing methods (like using a plastic or rubber molded finger to attack finger printing systems) or attacking the biometric interface with data stolen from other networks (like iris data ) and use that to impersonate the user. Are there methods to secure the hardware and ensure that the biometric reading is coming from an authentic device?... may interesting avenues.

@VipinB I have to send apologies in advance but I have an all-day meeting on our DHS DKMS (Decentralized Key Management System) project with BYU Internet Security Research Labs tomorrow, so I won't be able to attend the ID WG call. But I will on the call in two week, and will be happy to give an update on the DID spec. Also, I did put a writeup on DID/DDO architecture at the end of the draft Identity WG white paper document.

<p><strong>Oskar_van_Deventer</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 09:03:17 GMT):<br/>
Dear friends of the Hyperledger Identity working group,

Could I ask for your review of the document "After-the-fact mandate changes" (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1psJc9UWuteSzOqIG0VLIdzdlxFb9kq-Csw-dxcjPzEo), please?

The documents describes use cases that require the authorization over a smart contract to be changed after-the-fact without the smart contract getting executed. The document contains the following requirements
Requirement 1: A user (“anchor”) shall be able to sign over its authorization over a smart contract to another user (“guardian”) after the fact. 
1a: The original user (“anchor”) loses its authorization over the smart contract.
1b: The original user (“anchor”) maintains its authorization over the smart contract.
Requirement 2: A blockchain consortium shall be able to sign over the authorization over a smart contract from one user (“anchor”) to another user (“guardian”).
Requirement 3: It should be possible to re-assign the authorization over multiple or all a smart contracts for a user (“anchor”) to another user (“guardian”) in a single action.
Requirement 4: It should be possible to re-assign the authorization over a smart contract back to the original (“anchor”) user.
Requirement 5: The solution to requirements 1-4 shall not require the handing over of private keys.
Requirement 6: The solution to requirements 1-4 shall not require mutability of the blockchain.
Requirement 7: The introduction of a solution to requirements 1-4 should be backward compatible, such that they also apply to smart contracts that predate this introduction.
Requirement 8: The solution to requirements 1-4 may be programmable.

The document has been developed in the Hyperledger RequirementsWG for a month now, and it is close to getting finalized. So this would be a good time to ask for your review.

Looking forward to your reviews, comments and suggestions. Thank you!

Best regards,

Oskar

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 12:44:49 GMT):<br/>
@Oskar_van_Deventer Thanks for writing up the document. I am very curious how fabric handles lost keys. In your document, you also describe this case. I would think that lost keys (not necessarily got stolen) is quite common.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 12:45:42 GMT):<br/>
@Oskar_van_Deventer or wanting using the another identity (new one owned by same person) is also quite common.
</p>
<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 12:46:04 GMT):<br/>
in any of the case, it will require the modification to the contract.

Guys, this is a very familiar use case, under the heading of revocation, delegation etc. Almost always after the fact. We can discuss further. Current Implementations of DLT identity in Hyperledger DLTs follow hpki model or just a regular pki model, we can explore what is needed to extend these. Next audio call this coming Wednesday. Will be glad to have you @Oskar_van_Deventer and requirements wg present. Also curious to see what Indy guys like @nage or @drummondreed have to say.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 15:58:49 GMT):<br/>
This is indeed an important topic, and there is active work going on around this topic in Sovrin's community (AFAIK we don't have a WG around it yet, so ping @drummondreed if you're interested in getting involved).  The DID specification accounts for this through the use of additional keys in the control block.  You may have additional keys in that block that are allowed to do a key rotation under the right circumstances, and various different approaches are possible.  For a private ledger this process could be defined as some type of recovery transaction where the rest of the ledger agrees to update your key, but inside of Sovrin, we expect that identity service providers will compete for business based on what services they provide--including secure key recovery services.  We've talked about having identity escrow services, shamir's secret sharing schemes and many other approaches for having group consensus around rotating a key for someone who has lost their identity entirely.

I'm just getting to this channel after a day of other meetings. Three responses to the above 3 messages.
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Fri, 07 Jul 2017 02:44:45 GMT):<br/>
First, @VipinB and @tongli, the Sovrin community is indeed quite focused on the key management issues since without key management there is not blockchain identity. As @nage says, part of it can be dealt with via the provisions of the control block in the DID spec (https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2016/blob/master/final-documents/did-implementer-draft-10.pdf). But the rest of the key management puzzle is an architecture we call DKMS (Decentralized Key Management System) that Evernym is working on under contract with U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Happy to explain more about that if it helps. 
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Fri, 07 Jul 2017 02:46:09 GMT):<br/>
Also, RE @berserkr 's point, I am co-chair of the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) Identifiers, Names, and Discovery WG, of which DID architecture is the foundation, so happy to answer any questions there (as I get time to get on this channel - we are exploding in channels!)
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Fri, 07 Jul 2017 09:13:04 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB One note about the upcoming Identity WG meeting—I am attending the DHS S&T Cybersecurity Showcase this coming week AND have an extended Sovrin Foundation Trustee meeting on Wednesday. Normally it would end just before the ID WG, but this one is going to go for 90 mins instead of 60 (and might even go longer). So @nage may need to cover for me this week.

</p>
<p><strong>Oskar_van_Deventer</strong> (Mon, 10 Jul 2017 18:05:08 GMT):<br/>
@tongli The RequirementsWG document about after-the-fact mandate changes differs from lost keys. A typical before-the-fact solution to a lost key is assigning a bunch of friend and allow M-out--of-N friends sign your new key, in case you lost the old one. The essence of the "after-the-fact" is that no special measures had been taken beforehand. Still, there may some technical commonalities.

@VipinB I would be happy to join this Wednesday. That would be Wednesday 12 July, 12:00 PM (noon) New York summer time, correct? (I am at Central European Summer Time, which is 6 hours ahead, hence 6:00 PM for me) By the way, @drummondreed was one of the reviewers of the document during one of the RequirementsWG calls.

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Mon, 10 Jul 2017 19:14:36 GMT):<br/>
The initial design of the Fabric Membership or Identity services by Dr. Kravitz had some of these ideas built in- there is no after the fact in fact. Key loss, key delegation etc. was envisaged as part of the system setup from the beginning, this is not a public network context. This can still be worked back into the system- since key loss and partial and total delegation are use cases that we start with and have been part of the discussions in the Identity WG from the getgo. However, the implementations in the DLTs have followed the path of least pain to implement and have used simple Asymmetric cryptography with HPKI thrown in for good measure.

<p><strong>tongli</strong> (Tue, 11 Jul 2017 01:07:41 GMT):<br/>
@Oskar_van_Deventer Thanks for explaining the differences, I thought in both cases, it is a modification to the contract, who can be authorized to do that and how to establish that authority seems to be the key.

@here We have some ideas for the Agenda for our next call on July 26th.
1. An analysis of confidentiality & privacy topics as it relates to identity: We will use the base paper https://www.r3.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/survey_confidentiality_privacy_R3.pdf, this is a public paper from the R3 site.
2.Legal & regulatory underpinning for Identity- we will continue the discussion with reps from the Government sector (infrachain) and possibly a legal expert, may not happen until next meeting (August 9)
3.Verifiable claims (possibly with help from our friends from Indy/Sovrin)
4. Hope to have reworked material from our prior meetings as well as other contributions into the White paper. (mainly biometrics, Legal, use case around key management presented by Oskar DV)
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 14:18:58 GMT):<br/>

@VipinB I am coming but will be about 10 mins late to this morning's call.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 15:58:57 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB do you have any idea how you want to time box the analysis of confidentiality and privacy topics discussion?  It seems like it would be easy to spend the whole hour on that r3 document, especially where we can/should call out the limitations of the analysis relative to Hyperledger use cases (a simple example private blockchains can viably limit certain ledger disclosure, as is done with channels in Fabric).
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 15:59:13 GMT):<br/>
Is it our intent to create an equivalent document at some level, or just ponder the points made there?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 17:02:58 GMT):<br/>
@nage good point-I will try to condense the discussions from @Sean_Bohan's notes
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 17:03:04 GMT):<br/>
and the recordings
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 18:55:18 GMT):<br/>
Re: channels, do all members of the channels have transparency into everything in the channel, even transactions before they were inducted into the channel? I seem to remember that the answer to this is yes. Which is a quite a privacy hole @nage 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 18:56:04 GMT):<br/>
We did end up talking about all the other points. even though the bulk of the time was spent on the doc. 
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 19:19:28 GMT):<br/>
Agreed, just pointing out that constraints matter a lot to the arguments outlined in the doc, and the resulting privacy largely depends on how those constraints are shuffled
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 14:37:22 GMT):<br/>
@nage the doc was just teed up to get us talking about the topic. Even noting the differences was useful.

Some ideas proposed by Thomas Hardjono
Ideas for Hyperledger:

- PKI-specific blockchain: We could look at a ledger system built atop the Fabric that provided an more efficient implementation of features inherent to PKI.

- Blockchain for Bridge-CA:  Could a blockchain be used to effect a bridge among a group of CAs.

I can relate to the feeling of wearisomeness of having "blockchain" thrown about as magic elixir to solve a bunch of problems that may not even be related to the actual problem characteristics / patterns that distributed ledgers can tackle. Further, it will take time to develop the language that provides people with the ability to differentiate between different technological capabilities aimed at specific problem pattern which happen to use distributed ledger as one of the ingredients.
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 22:50:02 GMT):<br/>
some thoughts :)
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 23:05:17 GMT):<br/>
for example ... there are big differences between Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Indy as we know ...
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 08 Sep 2017 13:39:26 GMT):<br/>
Yes of course since HL Fabric is generic for any asset. Indy could be (re) built on top of HL Sawtooth or even Fabric (it is currently) I believe built on top of a protocol named Plenum
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 13:34:28 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanLevi and others just took a look at the viewpoint from Dr. Hoepman, in short
1. It is specifically directed at Blockcerts
2. There is nothing like "The Blockchain"
3. There is no privacy
4. It injects another third party (namely the one that manages the Blockcerts)
5. The solution it presents is ABC (Attribute Based Credentials)

These are rebutted to a great extent in the responses in the link posted by @jljordan_bcgov

One item that is missing from Blockcerts implementation, uPort etc. are the fact that public blockchains that were intended to be for crypto currency (in the case of Bitcoin) or World computer (in the case of Ethereum) both with underlying currencies that are highly volatile are used for the storage of Blockcerts and to ensure longevity. This is why a system like what Sovrin uses which is purpose built for Identity and supported by an Independent foundation could have a better chance of solving this particular concern. Of course they are also solving all of the other items mentioned like "unlinkability", "Selective Disclosure" etc. Hopefully we can also solve the Achilles heel of most of these systems which is private key loss or theft that can lead to total loss of ownership of your identity. Maybe there are solutions to this that I am not aware of.
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 14:31:31 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB The R&D work that Evernym is currently doing under contract with DHS on DKMS (decentralized key management system) is direct at exactly your point: "Hopefully we can also solve the Achilles heel of most of these systems which is private key loss or theft that can lead to total loss of ownership of your identity." I agree it is completely non-trivial, but using Sovrin agents and wallets—both edge-based and cloud-based—we believe we can solve this using an open and interoperable standard. I'd be happy to do a briefing on our DKMS work on the next WG call if that helps.

<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 14:32:07 GMT):<br/>
Here's a writeup on DKMS that we did for the spring Rebooting the Web of Trust conference: https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-spring2017/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/dkms-decentralized-key-mgmt-system.md

</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 18:28:57 GMT):<br/>
One of the things we could contemplate in British Columbia regarding private key loss (and I definitely don't understand the specific mechanics of this) is that our citizens have been issues a "Services Card" that has an embedded EMV chip which is unique. I wonder if a citizen remains in possession of that card if they could use that as a means to recover a lost key on their phone app. 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 19:09:47 GMT):<br/>
Another item that I did not cite from Dr Hoepman's blog is the problem of credential binding...Maybe there are well known solutions to this as well.

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 19:13:13 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanLevi Will read the nist paper and comment
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 19:14:28 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB Yes, I believe the DKMS work will answer that requirement.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 19:14:54 GMT):<br/>
So looks like @drummondreed could talk about the reception in regulatory terms to DiDs in Estonia and Finland as well as DKMS for meeting.
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 19:15:20 GMT):<br/>
Yes, happy to do both

We need to be looking at the Identity aspect of the Luxembourg initiatives through FundChain and LuxTrust and I was hoping that Marco Houwen of Infrachain may speak about that and about Cambridge Blockchain- we may need to tee this up for a later occasion. We need to look at the jurisdictional heterogeny in Identity requirements and how this view can be supported as well. The Canadians through securekey etc as well as MAS through some of their initiatives may provide the backdrop for this. As we need concrete ways in which this heterogeny can be handled (either in a single Blockchain that have nodes in all these localities or interoperating with chains based in these localities)

@here Dublin hackathon needs topics in digital Identity since it is one their main themes. I have given them a tentative list. quoted below. Any other suggestions welcome. Hackathon is in Dublin Sept 30-Oct 1

1.	Interoperability with Legacy systems.  Extend the trust envelope to encompass Legacy systems used in the Enterprise
2.	Unlinkability- how does this operate in the Enterprise space, does it even matter? What about transactions and the visibility to participants.
3.	Integrate ZPK or other methods to prove certain statements revealing as little as possible about the identity of the participants
4.	Selective Disclosure:  How can an Identity disclose the minimum (even to legitimate counterparties) to get our transaction done?
5.	Interoperability between chains and its effect on Identity.
6.	Revocation/Key loss, theft or removal of privileges and continuity of transactions. This can involve people getting assigned different roles.
7.	Interaction between public Identities (available on a self sovereign solution, like SOVRIN/Indy) and Identity on one of the Enterprise chains under Hyperledger.

I would add
-ID2020 - can it be implemented under Indy or some such DLT- create a small PoC to implement
-How to make schemes like Aadhar more self-sovereign following the new legal rulings from Supreme court of India
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 14:47:39 GMT):<br/>
Great list. My only additional suggested topics might be the DID spec (https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) and verifiable claims (https://www.w3.org/2017/vc/charter.html).

Hi everyone. Two things: @here we just cross signed with DIF, so now both organizations are associate members of each other. Thats a great step of bringing various pieces of the puzzle together.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 16:14:40 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 02:54:51 GMT):<br/>
@mpiekarska Yes, very good news on DIF, I think it will be a real benefit for both. And I can't wait to get time to go through the GDPR white paper.

@mpiekarska  How will DiF collaborate with us? I also know of other cross signing deals like with the Accord Project. Just want to know concrete ways in which this collaboration can be leveraged (by both parties)
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 14:21:54 GMT):<br/>
I suppose I should ask @bbehlendorf as well...

Im the Hyperledger's delegate to DiF and through me we are contributing ideas and concepts. 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 14:28:52 GMT):<br/>
How can we bring back some of the ideas from DiF into the Identity WG and our own standards? Will you assist with that @mpiekarska 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 14:29:24 GMT):<br/>
Should we have Daniel Buchner speak at one of our calls?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 14:29:55 GMT):<br/>
We can also link some of the DiF work into our own docs/calls etc.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 14:30:09 GMT):<br/>
Marta will be a great bridge for this but we also expect other Hyperledger members to be involved in both and also act as bridges.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Mon, 16 Oct 2017 14:30:22 GMT):<br/>
e.g. view Marta as a bridge, not a gateway
</p>

as mentioned in the ID WG call this morning: https://decentralize.today/a-new-attack-vector-to-deanonymize-bitcoin-users-9c6dc433d4b6 , there is some FUD but in light of the GDPR discussion, worth a look.overall.

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 19:17:59 GMT):<br/>
Seems like this leakage is happening on the edges (i.e. the user's own browsers)-This is quite interesting as we can infer that the weakest link (even with all the privacy built into the infrastructure systems) will be on the edges, anytime websites are used in browsers that do not provide adequate protection you can be compromised; including web wallets or websites you buy merchandise from paying for it using crypto. This is why there needs to be a good wallet software or a crypto aware browser, currently I know of none (Bravo/BATS is for other purposes)..

Hi guys, not sure if this is the right chat for this question, but I’m following the indy install process, as documented here (https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-environments/blob/master/vagrant/training/vb-multi-vm/TestIndyClusterSetup.md).  When I come to “Setting Up a CLI Client and Configuring the Agents in the Indy Cluster” and use vagrant to ssh into the cli01 host, and run “indy”, the “indy” binary is not found.  Infact, the “indy” binary itself doesn’t seem to be installed on cli01 or any of the validator nodes.  Other indy related artifacts are though.  Perhaps I’m missing something or the guide is out of date (although it was updated 11 days ago).  Can anyone point me in the right direction?

Vipin, I have a conflict today due to this week being the Evernym bi-annual summit meeting in Utah. This pains me as I'd like to join both the GDPR and white paper discussions. But I'm hard stuck in the summit meeting this morning. Sorry.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 19:45:17 GMT):<br/>
Thanks Drummond for the heads up. I would like to know more about what happened in Singapore w.r.t. banks interest in Indy- Susan was on the call
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 19:55:49 GMT):<br/>
I was not in Singapore; that was Phil Windley, chair of the Sovrin Foundation. I think he'd be happy to attend a call as a guest if you'd like. He'd just need tenough notice.

Hi guys,

I am relatively new to Hyperledger and currently looking into access management on Fabric. 
To my understanding, access to channels is granted through the scope of organizations, where each organization represents one company.

User access is than granted by a single peer run by the company.
Therefore, user access is handled on the peer and off-chain.
Did I get this right?
Is it possible to run multiple peers within one company and have them store access information on the chain to further decentralize my network?

I hope this is the right place for this kind of question.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 15:05:38 GMT):<br/>
Use the fabric-ca channel to ask fabric specific questions, this will yield quicker and truer answers @C0rnelius

There are folks that are part of the Hyperledger Identity WG that work closely with the Digital Identity Foundation. From the charter, this is what this WG is focused on: 
>The purpose of the Identity Working Group is to discuss, research, and document ways to capture, store, transmit and use Identities on the DLT, specifically for the projects under the Hyperledger umbrella. The Identities can be of nodes that participate in the running of the DLT or entities that transact on the DLT.
>The scope is limited to the various lifecycle events and use of Identity needed to securely participate in the Hyperledger Project DLT implementations.  The group will focus on the functional details first, and subsequently work towards a reference implementation.

Thanks, @VipinB , for hosting the call yesterday.  Quite a bit of knowledge represented!  I was on and off so didn't jump in, but I heard the message loud and clear that there's a desire to get some more momentum going on the white paper.  I'd love to help if I can, and it would be helpful to me if one of the group veterans could provide the elevator pitch/newbie orientation for the white paper including:   1) a list of the intended audience(s) 2) the background that those audiences would be presumed to have and 3) A summary of what we hope those audiences would take away from reading the paper.  That introduction would make it quite a bit easier for us new people to contribute effectively.

@VipinB et al, my apologies for not being able to attend today—am in a Hyperledger Indy summit that is taking my full attention (but well worth it). I'll try to be on in 2 weeks.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:06:51 GMT):<br/>
@here todays call agenda quickly converged on the European and PSD II, GDPR, MiFID etc. There was some serious discussion on eIDas Some correlation for interoperability among sovereign IDs across the EU.

I'm messing around with storing users as DIDs in my software... since DIDs have dropped authorization and suggest to use capabilities... is there anyway to attach additional fields to a DID? I see "metadata" is in progress... what I would like to do is set "initialCapability" - so that maybe a DID couldn't edit itself, etc
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Mon, 29 Jan 2018 06:13:16 GMT):<br/>
Yes, you can extend a DID document to include other properties by adding your own JSON-LD context.

</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 17:45:47 GMT):<br/>
this working group could focus on how to apply all of the cool identity on the blockchain technology that's coalescing
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 17:47:33 GMT):<br/>
I guess you guys can't hear me
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 17:47:46 GMT):<br/>
I don't think this WG needs to cover everything
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 17:48:05 GMT):<br/>
why not pick one reasonable integration/solution and work through the issues and report on it
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 17:48:19 GMT):<br/>
e.g. using Indy for identity in conjunction with Sawtooth
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 17:48:22 GMT):<br/>
or something like that
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 17:48:26 GMT):<br/>
I have had to leave the audio but I agree with Dave's suggestion that the WG focus on how to apply the cool blockchain identity tech being developed in Hyperledger projects
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 17:49:26 GMT):<br/>
or even just something like "verifiable claims in practice"
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 17:49:58 GMT):<br/>
how would an enterprise deploy one of our blockchains to do a tangible identity application
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 17:50:25 GMT):<br/>
of course it's not just about writing a paper, it would be about doing a demonstration project and then writing about it
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 17:50:45 GMT):<br/>
a series of blog posts or something like that
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 18:01:04 GMT):<br/>
https://www.bcdevexchange.org/projects/prj-verifiable-organizations-network---theorgbook
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 18:01:21 GMT):<br/>
I love the idea of a demonstration project. Evernym is currently working on several pilots, some of which could potentially serve as demo projects. Note that several of them are with governmental agencies like the one that Sean just listed.

FYI, if healthcare in your area of interest, and/or you are attending HIMSS, the #healthcare-wg is also planning on having representatives present. There may be some synergy between the workgroups as issues of identity are omnipresent in healthcare, and some of the participants in the group like my form YouBase, contend with issues of identity, data, trust, consent, etc. Would be great if we can find a way to cross-pollenate.

Cheers,

@NateDiNiro Saw your note re: collaboration with Identity WG. That would be good. This week we are breaking the sections of the paper for work into sections. We will post on ID WG email list as well as this channel. As far as HIMSS is concerned, it was brought up on our call as a call to volunteer and as an opportunity for our members. There are some people from the healthcare industry who participate in the bi-weekly calls. I do not know whether they are members of healthcare-wg.

@here 
What has been accomplished !
1.	Create sections 
What needs to be accomplished!
1.	Cleanup of the Paper (move out comments and unfinished segments into a separate doc)
2.	Volunteers and due dates for the sections.
3.	Suggestions from community- before next meeting and ongoing- how to monitor status etc.
4.	Sections – Put in some meat and a rough status 
5.	Further breakdown of sections 
6.	Created a comprehensive Reference section

Some of the Dimensions of Identity to be filled out in the sections below 
•	Threat Surfaces & Threat Models
•	Lifecycle of Identity in the Blockchain-Portability, Recoverability, Reissuance, Revocability 
•	Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and provability
•	Anonymity and Privacy including unlinkability.
•	Reputation, Personas, Delegation to proxies 
•	Multi-Factor-Biometrics, other methods
•	Regulations and Identity (European regulations/others)- eIDAs, PSD II, GDPR, MiFID, MAS etc.
•	Legal implications (Digital Signatures)

Feedback so far:
•	Looks too comprehensive, so need to boil it down and address details in sub-documents or documents that are linked
•	Use more of a use case approach to discuss how threat models or scenarios can be dealt with in lifecycle, regulations etc. This might provide more of an intro to non-technical people.
•	
Each Section to be approximately 200-500 words
Sections of the Identity WG document:
1.	Introduction- pretty complete
2.	Use Cases
3.	PKI
4.	Central authority –Or Federated Identity
5.	X.500 & LDAP Systems
6.	Self-Sovereignty
7.	DiDs
8.	Standards: OAuth, UMA, OpenID
9.	Interoperability
10.	Identity Models in Hyperledger DLTs
a.	Indy
b.	Sawtooth
c.	Fabric
d.	Burrow
e.	Quilt
f.	Iroha
11.	Interface for an Identity Utility:
12.	Proposal & Project Plan for an implementation:
13.	References:
14.	Contributors:

Ram wants to talk.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 18:23:35 GMT):<br/>
Good call today.
Items we talked about: Sections of the paper
There were views on two broad sections from Nitin as well as from Hart- Nitin focused on the divide between the use cases and the models-implementation Whereas Hart said that there is a divide between the technical aspects (i.e. Identity of the nodes vs. Identity of Transactors in use cases). Also we know that there would be linkage between the two sorts of identity (nodes vs transactors) as the bootstrapping process would verify the nodes first and through that the Transactors. Vipin & James to collaborate on creating a skeleton of the paper before the meeting.

We also discussed two other items: ID2020 - technical direction and as a general use case- we will talk to Marta who will be the HL representative in the ID2020 workshop and get her feedback on this.
Also  project plan for intern (mentored by Indy people and Identity WG)
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 18:26:32 GMT):<br/>
Sean will make the project proposal for intern public. Of course in time for comments before Friday the 23rd.

Sections/Sub-Sections of the Identity WG document (We will create a doc for just this part): We just have the following suggestions with the number of words- we may rework this later. Phase 2 will be evaluated later. We have not put anything in for methods (like biometrics/two factor/HSM etc.), nor threat models. About 5000 words accounted for so far. Maybe this projection is too much.
1.	Introduction (500-max)
General Intro to the paper, basic definitions, what are we attempting to do, general narrative arc. Status-almost complete – Volunteer- Vipin Bharathan- need people to proof and suggest
2.	Use Cases & Scenarios  (1000)
At least four use cases from different areas in the Enterprise- should cover boot strapping, on-boarding, changes, revocation, roles, expiry- each to cover about 100 words
Suggestions:
Cash on Ledger (public use case), Pure Identity (Indy), RTGS (Real Time Gross settlement), Payment, Health Records
Community can suggest other use cases:
Status-There is nothing here –volunteers needed

3.	Standards & Regulations: One is existing standards in Identity, two are regulations Volunteers needed- (1200)
        a.	OAuth,  UMA, OpenID (600)
        b.	Regulations  eIDAs, PSD II, GDPR, MiFID, MAS etc. (600)
4.	Identity Warriors Brief writeup on each with relevance to our work- about 100 words each- volunteers needed(500)
         a.	Verifiable Claims Working Group
         b.	RWOT
         c.	ID2020
         d. IIW
         e.	DiF

5.	Implementing  Identity Schemes-  Each needs a volunteer- except for ones noted explicitly(1000)
         a.	PKI- Describe PKI 100 words max
         b.	Central authority – Federated authority- Describe CAs 100 words max
         c.	X.500 & LDAP Systems- Describe standards 200 words
         d.	Self-Sovereignty – Concept 100 words- 
               i.	DiDs &	Verifiable Claims  Describe current  standards 200 words
          e.	Interoperability – How would DiD->DDO->verifiable claim interact with Legacy, Blockchains with Legacy- How would chains interact-DiD TLS 200 words- Status- Vipin Bharathan volunteer
6.	Identity Models in Hyperledger DLTs- Each will need a write-up of about 200 words, focus on lifecycle.- and mapping to common standard- ( 1200)
          a.	Indy
          b.	Sawtooth-We have something here-needs review
          c.	Fabric We have something here-needs review
          d.	Burrow-We need a writeup
          e.	Quilt -We need a writeup
          f.	Iroha We have something here-needs review
7.	Interface for an Identity Utility – Extract Core functions- This is Phase 2- after most of the above sections have been written.
8.	Proposal & Project Plan for an implementation: Map to efforts in Indy- How can we implement 7. Above and what benefits will be bring-Intern work coming up etc. Also Phase 2

From Giedre to Everyone:  11:18 AM
What is the due date to write a paper volunteered?
 
From Bill to Everyone:  11:19 AM
which sections are filled with volunteers?  Note: the googledoc was very active with attendees volunteering and filling in by section where they want to contribute.
 
From Mike Brown (ATB) to Everyone:  11:35 AM
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zDPVDer9G-IjqicB65G9Uo2RhzpYLY4mGpVpEPu_Wt4/edit#
 
From Bill to Everyone:  11:38 AM
The link below is a reliability/complexity vs. use case initially drafted for TSC use 1-1/2 years ago.  Bill and Jeremy jointly presented this document and a pptx link found at the base of the link.  
 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XRthcv04nVQC6D0qe6TvYrTO1o5TeVKOqwLLltulkV0/edit
just dropped the use case vs. reliability link above.  Needs some updating but still relevant.

@here Meeting minutes captured by Bill S
Notes and chat capture from today's ID WG call.  Not the greatest but certainly a reasonable capture.
 
Discussion of Vision vs. Introduction- Vipin + Hart
     Sean was inserted as a place holder for the vision section pending his approval / agreement
 
Identity blockchain vs. outside blockchain- understanding of what identity is- Vipin, Hart, Hugo discussed
 
Hart volunteers for crypto descriptions in section 6
 
See the google doc https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zDPVDer9G-IjqicB65G9Uo2RhzpYLY4mGpVpEPu_Wt4/edit?usp=drivesdk for the more complete volunteer list by section. 
 
Vipin- indicates word length not cast in stone.  Can be less or more.  Objective is to be able to complete in an afternoon.
 
Vipin will contact folks from Indy, QLT, etc. that were not on the call today.
 
Vipin suggested that all chat should also be dropped into RocketChat.  He will drop these notes in.
 
Note:  I did not see where attendees were adding themselves to this weeks call list for capture purposes.  I failed to screen capture the list from the call.  Bill

</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 18:18:11 GMT):<br/>
We will add these to the minutes later
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 18:21:42 GMT):<br/>
I also captured notes in the meeting minutes doc. Combination with those from Bill S would be great!

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 14:38:08 GMT):<br/>
@here About the paper-sections-
Try doing with the suggested number of words, it is very important to keep references to what you have researched or read for future insertion into the references section. If the number of words is too restrictive, my suggestion would be to write it like you feel and then slim down while preserving the sense with other people's help. The main idea is to survey(briefly) what the idea/regulation/section means, then how is it significant for Blockchain implementation and how it will affect the interface(s) and implementation of an Identity Utility
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:54:17 GMT):<br/>
@ashutosh_kumar not able to post directly to you for some strange reason
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:54:37 GMT):<br/>
Hmm.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:55:03 GMT):<br/>
So I cannot continue my chat with you since I am not able to answer your questions directly
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:55:21 GMT):<br/>
Does section/subsection need to tie back to Blockchain somehow ? 
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:55:42 GMT):<br/>
e.g pros/cons etc.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:55:43 GMT):<br/>
So the section above is also directed to your question about the depth
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:56:06 GMT):<br/>
Yes that is what I suggest "The main idea is to survey(briefly) what the idea/regulation/section means, then how is it significant for Blockchain implementation and how it will affect the interface(s) and implementation of an Identity Utility "
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:56:40 GMT):<br/>
Yes if there are any contra indications we should say it too
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:56:51 GMT):<br/>
Like "The right to be forgotten"
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:57:08 GMT):<br/>
OK. Will try.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:57:36 GMT):<br/>
Just give it a shot, then we can reconnect on the actual wording
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 15:57:56 GMT):<br/>
Do as many as you can? Or just one? Whatever you are able.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 16:00:27 GMT):<br/>
The tough thing will be to condense

Another reminder that we have a discount code for The Internet Identity Workshop in Mountain View in April, if you’re interested in discussing blockchain identity with other folks who like to think about identity systems and issues, please join us https://iiw26.eventbrite.com?discount=HL_XXVI_20. (There will be a big contingent of Indy users and contributors there, in addition to folks from the W3C credentials community and many other decentralized and centralized identity systems).

@here
Call Tomorrow 03/21/2018 12 noon EST will happen on Zoom...(details below)

This is an open call, all are welcome.

Agenda:
Work on paper. We have arrived at the following working method collectively:
 
Document for volunteering: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zDPVDer9G-IjqicB65G9Uo2RhzpYLY4mGpVpEPu_Wt4/edit?usp=drivesdk 

includes the sections and brief descriptions to work on the Identity WG Paper. We also have an estimate of the length (in words).   Please take a look and volunteer to do a section.   References are important and please keep track of the works you reference as you go along. 

Once you feel your section is complete, please insert it into the paper (we can always refine this further).  Current Volunteers (you know who you are), please insert your contributions. 
The paper is:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ExFNRx-yYoS8FnDIUX1_0UBMha9TvQkfts2kVnDc4KE/edit#
We will review progress.

I have finished and inserted section on PKI with references. I have also organised most of the sections with appropriate styles in the paper itself.
Project proposal for Intern- Indy folks have put together for Identity work. Discuss if the mentors are on the call

@VipinB I am heads down on two end-of-March deadlines (our DHS DKMS project and the second Sovrin white paper), so I won't be able to attend tomorrow. @nage should be able to fill in for me to report on Rebooting the Web of Trust. And the DID spec is coming along nicely and feeling pretty stable, though I won't be able to complete my action items on a few sections until early April.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 12:51:37 GMT):<br/>
I actually currently have a recurring conflict with the Identity WG meeting time and won’t be able to attend today on short notice.  @kdenhartog could you give this report today?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 15:29:51 GMT):<br/>

@Jayamine This is something that we haven't nailed down in any capacity yet. There's been great work in this area and we have some ideas around how it might work, but we want to make sure that many different solutions can emerge while remaining interoperable. Some examples to check out would be work done by Markus Sabadello and sponsored by the British Colombia government found here. https://github.com/bcgov/did-auth-extension There's also been other work created by Manu Sporny and the guys at OpenBazaar which can be found here https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 17:08:14 GMT):<br/>

@here I will be travelling on April 4th and will not be able to run the ID WG call. I will need a volunteer to run the call. Otherwise we can cancel the call, which will give us time to keep working on the paper. What is the sentiment among the people?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 20:17:03 GMT):<br/>
A good number of us will be at the Internet Identity Workshop at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View that day.  We are having a meeting co-located at IIW starting 30 minutes after the Identity WG call normally starts (9:30-10:30 Pacific Time), we would love to have anyone from the Identity WG call join as well.  Could that be an alternative to the normal call that day?  @windley or @drummondreed may have more information on the Sovrin discussion that is being planned.

As I'm not part of the wg (yet?), I'll post my comments here. :) Thank you for tackling this crucial subject. For me the most delicate point is how to handle the erasure. While there's an outline in the whitepaper about the possible blockchain-based process of a erasure request, the topic of how to implement an erasure within the current hyperledger space seems to be left out (on purpose?). Maybe I just missunderstood something?

Another tought: If Alice requests all her data to be deleted, the request itself should be deleted as well and can not be permanently stored in a blockchain for anyone (even an auditor) to be seen, shouldn't it?

Hi all, I believe your next meeting is on Wednesday 30th so I will join per @VipinB 's invitation. 

However, I would like to comment my problem in advance.
I'm trying to integrate main ETH with Fabric in a similar way as Parity is doing using Bridge smart contract between Main and Private ethereum. 
In Parity, when an account wants to send back to main ethereum a token, the private nodes that form the blockchain sign a message and submits 
the collection of signatures with the message to a smart contract in main ETH. 

If the signatures are from predefined ETH address (or their public keys), then frozen tokens in main Ethereum are recovered back.

I'm following a similar approach, in which I'm sending the signature of endorsing peers and using the payload of a predefined transaction as the message.
The problem is that each time the endorsing peers sign the payload, they are generating a different signature from a different private key.
This makes it impossible to validate in main ethereum if the signatures is from a predefined address. 

I believe this is because of the Identity Mixer imlementation in fabric, as per documentation I see:
”Signing Transactions (Presentation). 
When a client (or possibly a peer) needs to sign a transaction, it generates a fresh unlinkable presentation token, which: 
1) signs the transaction content, 
2) proves a possession of a valid ECert issued by the CA, 
3) discloses the attributes that are required by the access control policy for the transaction.  “

Does anybody can help me figure out if this is possible to do?
</p>
<p><strong>manu</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 19:25:02 GMT):<br/>
pretty sure its unrelated to idemix, the default way of signing is with ecdsa and fixed public keys, and idemix isn't even in the release yet. 
</p>
<p><strong>RodrigoAcosta</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 20:34:31 GMT):<br/>
mm, any idea why I'm getting different signatures of the same message then? I'm using JAVA sdk.
But from a successful response of a chaincode invocation, I do 
byte[] message = response.getProposalResponse().getResponse().getPayload().toByteArray();
byte[] signature = response.getProposalResponse().getEndorsement().getSignature().toByteArray();
and get different signatures each time for the same message.

Let us also post this on #fabric-ca  @RodrigoAcosta. As far as the #identity-wg goes we have a broader interest in your project as it concerns interoperability in the HL space (Fabric to Ethereum can be thought of as that) and how Identity plays an important role in this space.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/identity-wg?msg=hqSkNEr3X7kdetiFk) @VipinB Yes DeSoto is the defacto leader in this space. I believe within a couple decades, all land titles will be managed in blockchain. While government sponsored projects have been the standard way for pushing title registration, I believe blockchain has the power to create a bottom-up approach. Thereby allowing poorer countries to leapfrog ahead.  
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sun, 17 Jun 2018 22:14:41 GMT):<br/>
@szewong DeSoto is a polarizing figure, since analysis of informal title in certain economies may not be straightforward, due to hijacking of legal and enforcement structures, so just granting land rights may not be enough...since many of that will end up with people who do not use or occupy the land.
</p>
<p><strong>szewong</strong> (Sun, 17 Jun 2018 23:43:27 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/identity-wg?msg=vpySuwfF8BJdQXqzg) @VipinB Our approach is based on detailed on-the-ground survey and bottom-up approach. Just like bitcoin created a currency without the backing of any authority, we are trying to organize land-right village-by-village.
</p>
<p><strong>szewong</strong> (Sun, 17 Jun 2018 23:44:31 GMT):<br/>

@VipinB My name is Marissa and I'm leading the patient subgroup for the Healthcare WG. We are starting to think about a build that would connect patient data across silos, but we've had a lot of questions come up regarding the identity aspects of the use case. Once we have our case built out, would you be willing to join one of our calls to discuss the identity aspects of the work?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Mon, 16 Jul 2018 12:26:08 GMT):<br/>
Sure @Mari499 ! We also have a section of paper regarding use cases, and the healthcare use case is prominent among them. Could you collaborate and review this. When are your meetings? There are others in the Identity WG who are experts in the Healthcare field; Iwill be sure to point them in your direction. Do you have any description of how the Patient subgroup differs from the Healthcare WG?
</p>
<p><strong>Mari499</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 13:56:51 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/identity-wg?msg=vT7gntQJtKLH6BsC3) @VipinB @VipinB - Thanks for your response. I would be happy to send your use case section out to the subgroup for review. The patient subgroup meets every 2 weeks on Fridays at 9am PST. Our next meeting is this Friday, 7/20. Regarding how we are defining the HCWG patient subgroup - our primary focus right now is to build out a demo for a patient-centered blockchain solution. The way that I see it is that the subgroups are more focused on the tactical implementation vs larger thought leadership, but that is just my view. I don't think we'd be ready for you to join our call this week, but what about August 3rd?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 16:01:51 GMT):<br/>
@Mari499 will do. should I mark my calendar for Aug 3rd- send me your burning questions re Identity so that I can prepare. What Blockchain will you build your HC use case on? HL Fabric? HL Iroha? HL Sawtooth?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 16:02:22 GMT):<br/>

@here It has been noticed that the IDWG document was changed in the recent days. Please do not edit this document directly with irrelevant material, in the last few days (July 29, 30, 31 2018 ) the document has been edited and sections replaced with personal data. The same effect can be achieved by creating a separate document and sharing with others. The same person had closed several resolved comments as well as reopened others. This may be an inadvertent action. We want people to collaborate openly; not delete material that has been created with much effort. So until we resolve these issues we will keep the content protected. I am reverting the content back to before these changes. You can still contribute by emailing content to the mailing list. I will ensure that this with correct attribution still gets into the document. People with links can comment, but not edit the document.

@VipinB I again have to offer regrets for today's meeting as I'm attending the CULedger Advisory Council meeting in Chicago today. But please pass this on to the Identity WG: *This entire meeting is about a global digital credential (MyCUID) based on Hyperledger Indy and Sovrin*. So it is HAPPENING.

I think this all relates to a recent question in the sovrin forum as well: https://forum.sovrin.org/t/how-to-guarantee-a-seed-document-is-associated-with-single-identity/893

Thanks @canadaduane

As an aside: The way I encountered this is through a request to our community members to tell us about decentralized identity solutions that should be on our radar (at Mainframe). So it's interesting to me that there is a perception out there that eKYC and reputation and credit ratings is what people think are "identity" solutions, rather than SSI like Sovrin and uPort.

<p><strong>canadaduane</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 17:04:30 GMT):<br/>
There is even some discussion in the ERC-725 (ethereum on-chain identity proposal) about claims and how to attach negative claims to people if they can just create their own, new identities all of the time.
</p>
<p><strong>canadaduane</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 17:04:54 GMT):<br/>
It seems there is a natural tension between SSI and more centralized reputation systems.

Questions:

Hi, We, the Hyperledger Identity working group, is putting together a white-paper about the Digital Identity on blockchains. The target audience of this white paper are people who are just getting into the Identity world. I would like to ask the following question with regard to <Project Name>:

Identity based solutions such as Indy and uPort:
1. What is the key differentiator of your Did/DDO solution?
2. How is privacy handled? Where does PII reside in your solution and how is it protected? From correlation attacks?
3. How do you address the “Username/Password” issue? Meaning people have to maintain too many passwords and the fact that passwords are not secure.
4. How do you address interoperability with existing identity systems (LDAP and Active Directory)?
5. What are the special features that make your solution fit well within a blockchain context?

Other DLTs: Fabric, Sawtooth, Iroha, Quilt, Burrow
1. How does your solution handle identity?
2. How do you address the “Username/Password” issue? Meaning people have to maintain too many passwords and the fact that passwords are not secure.
3. Does your solution address Self Sovereign Identity? If so, how?
4. Does your solution address Distributed Identity? If so, how?


</p>
<p><strong>szewong</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 17:07:05 GMT):<br/>
Hi all, just want to post the questions here. Please help get answers from different groups. I am willing to do the work if you will tell me where to go. Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>szewong</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 17:07:56 GMT):<br/>
@canadaduane Can you explain a little bit about what you are looking from in terms of Identity?
</p>
<p><strong>szewong</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 17:08:03 GMT):<br/>
From the perspective of Mainframe?
</p>
<p><strong>canadaduane</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 17:12:00 GMT):<br/>
Yes, so we're building decentralized identity into our desktop app, which is a "launcher" for decentralized apps custom-built to our platform's specs. The goal is to make it much easier for developers to create decentralized apps than it is today; if we bundle several services together, like decentralized identity, decentralized file storage, decentralized (anonymous) communications, etc. then it will draw more companies and developers to make their apps decentralized. So imagine a decentralized Facebook, or a decentralized Reddit, or decentralized Telegram--each of these are potential "dApps" on the Mainframe platform.
</p>
<p><strong>canadaduane</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 17:14:43 GMT):<br/>
The goal of identity in this Launcher would be several: 1. to create a "single-sign on" experience (so you don't have to log in to each dApp separately), 2. to create an environment where you can keep your community affiliations & credentials no matter what dApp you're using (even outside our platform), and 3. to make it easy to interact across many different blockchains, networks, services, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>canadaduane</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 17:19:27 GMT):<br/>
Lately we've been discussing another interesting "wish-list" item which is to make it so dApp developers never have to create a CAPTCHA again--i.e. wouldn't it be nice if there were a "Certified Human" credential that people could take with them. This is certainly possible within the SSI & verifiable credentials capabilities. But then there is a little trouble for the verifier--how do we know someone isn't creating multiple identities and then certifying each of them as Human? The verifier would need to create some kind of centralized list to make sure that John Doe hasn't signed up multiple times. Otherwise, "Certified Human" would mean nothing, because a single person could create multiple identities, get them each certified, and then hand them over to bots.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 17:24:49 GMT):<br/>
@canadaduane what is the DLT you are building on? Looks like Ethereum with talk of   dApps. Does it even involve Blockchain... Interesting parallel with Indy/Sovrin as they have a concept of Agents that sit higher on the stack.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 17:25:35 GMT):<br/>
And canadian govt app for wallets. I am guessing you know about this already

<p><strong>canadaduane</strong> (Fri, 21 Sep 2018 20:31:15 GMT):<br/>
I know there's been some difficulty finding the right terminology for "verifiable claims". We had an interesting internal discussion and have found "character claims" to be an interesting middle ground. "character" can mean both "the essence of who you are" as well as "a character in a play" or a costume that you put on. It spans both self-claims as well as claims made by others about you. It also moves the word "claim" away from the "insurance" connotation and safely toward the "he-says-she-says" meaning.

We've found "credentials" to be too constraining an English word for our use-case, where self-claims are the primary initial capability of our browser (within the context of identity). For instance, the answer to "what is your name?" is not safely within the normal use of "credential".

Yes, that makes the most sense when SSI is implemented at scale.

Vipin, the stars have aligned (for probably the last time this year) so I should be able to make the first 30 mins of tomorrow's call. Fingers crossed!
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 14:01:32 GMT):<br/>
Heard about your talk in Madrid.
</p>
<p><strong>jmason900</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 15:07:59 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB  I have another call today I have to attend so I'll miss today's meeting. I did propose some changes on the common use case requirements on the WP.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 15:10:33 GMT):<br/>
Saw that @jmason900 
</p>
<p><strong>jmason900</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 15:13:29 GMT):<br/>
also nothing happening in the next release on Fabric related to Indy integration... any of that work is for 2019
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 15:16:19 GMT):<br/>
We will try to incorporate mention of that Roadmap in the paper; since the example of Fabric will be used to illustrate the evolution or at least desire for Enterprise Blockchain Platforms to support existing Legacy infrastructure as well as support for developing standards like DiDs. 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 15:17:10 GMT):<br/>
Also I will tee up a discussion on standards in DiDs. Since @drummondreed  will be attending.

At this time, over 133,000 learners have participated in the edX courses. If you, or someone you know (university student, freelance developer, researcher, etc) is interested in contributing, please see the worksheet: 2019 Team and Individual/Small Group Objectives, Key Results, Participants and Tasks - https://goo.gl/1HzKaD  The worksheet has two tabs, one for contributions to the group's 2019 OKRs, and a second that notes individual contributions.  Feel free to message or reply with any questions. Thank you, Kelly

@nage thanks for the wallet proposal. I believe this could be one of the key initiatives under the Identity WG as we had discussed before. I will leave comments on the google docs, I would like to sponsor this proposal as it would be a key initiative for adoption for all dlt projects.

Vipin, sorry I can't make it today; just landed in London on way to Frankfurt for a meeting with a global consortium that wants to adopt DIDs and verifiable credentials (using Indy of course). With luck I'll report next week.

@VipinB Shows how far behind I am—I didn't even know @danielhardman was working on that. I just read the whole thing and I completely agree—AFAIC, Daniel is one of the best writers not just about Indy, but about any identity, security, or privacy technology—that I know. (And he's not just a technology writer either—he's a published novelist. See his books on Amazon.)

<p><strong>stanliberman</strong> (Wed, 06 Feb 2019 18:05:05 GMT):<br/>
@nage I have a question about the new project proposal. Firstly, I think it's a great idea to separate the ledger from the tools and libraries used to manage and varify the credentials.
</p>
<p><strong>stanliberman</strong> (Wed, 06 Feb 2019 18:05:43 GMT):<br/>
The question is (a little tongue in cheek): what is the value of HP Indy without everything that will be separated into the new project?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 06 Feb 2019 18:06:06 GMT):<br/>
:) Indy has some very unique properties to make it a verifiable data registry
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 06 Feb 2019 18:06:53 GMT):<br/>
but one of our goals here is to make the protocol more flexible for other chains.  I am hoping it means that other chains can adopt and use the protocol immediately and will pick up the Indy resolver and start anchoring things to Sovrin because of the practical benefits
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 06 Feb 2019 18:07:32 GMT):<br/>
(meaning state proofs, fully BFT consensus, immutability of objects related to the protocol like semantics support)

@here The Identity WG call set to take place this Wednesday(March 6) 12 noon EST is cancelled. We will have the call on March 20 as scheduled. We are searching for a time slot on alternate Wednesdays (March 13th etc.) so that it is convenient for APAC and Europe. I would think that 6 am EDT would be that time. We will try it on March 13th at 6am EDT.
Please let me know if you think that this will help the APAC and European participants. It will be at UTC-4 (since daylight savings start this coming Sunday(March 10) in the US).

Hello all,

Trying an experiment tomorrow by running multiple calls at different times with the same Agenda. This is an attempt to escape the time zone limitations of our calls.

4 pm UTC is good for The whole of North and South America as well as Europe and possibly parts of the near East.

12 midnight UTC the whole of East Asia, Australia etc.

We might fiddle with these dates and times. What is unknown at this point is the level of interest we might get

Two calls tomorrow:
4 pm UTC and 12 midnight UTC

@here 

A brief recap of the experiment conducted on the 20th which was to have two calls with roughly the same Agenda at different times to spur participation across the globe. Also, evangelized on other SIGs and working groups to have cross pollination.

The Identity WG calls had a lot of discussion and two compelling presentations on DiDs and related technologies (SSI). Please look at the meeting notes and recordings to get a sense of the depth of the analysis, questions, connections drawn. We conclude that having two calls has increased participation. We will continue the two call format.

We invite Identity experts from all of the DLTs in Hyperledger and elsewhere to give their views and guide us in what Enterprises are expecting today as far as Identity Management systems go and their pain-points and their solutions. Also useful would be insight into actual use cases and their plans to integrate divided Identity systems.  

We will continue the two call format going forward; the next call(s) on the 3rd of April.
- There will be a presentation on the India Community Group on April 1(sic) on the ID WG; 
- Updated paper is being driven towards a draft version.

Suggested Agenda for the next call :

1. Demo of universal resolver by DiF
2. Convergence of solutions (DiF, Solid and others), how they affect us 
3. Layer 2 Identity protocols (for privacy of data and meta-data)- common effects
4. Roadmap towards an Agent 2 Agent protocol
5. Digital Wallets and their importance for Identity Management

<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Sat, 23 Mar 2019 21:14:48 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman Yes, I gave that same advice to Vipin when I showed the SSI stack diagram on last week's call. I think the Hyperledger Identity WG should start engaging the Indy Agent WG in an active dialog, since that's where all the action is right now. 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sun, 24 Mar 2019 01:40:11 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman @drummondreed welcome that. 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sun, 24 Mar 2019 01:48:04 GMT):<br/>
Are there other A2A protocols being developed?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sun, 24 Mar 2019 16:00:45 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman will you be willing to talk about A2A or should I be showing up at the Indy Agent WG and get some learnings from that to talk to the people in Identity WG?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sun, 24 Mar 2019 16:01:55 GMT):<br/>
Since Identity WG is cross DLT and also needs to look at the A2A landscape in general. We must generalize.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sun, 24 Mar 2019 16:45:18 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 25 Mar 2019 15:32:54 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB I would be happy to come and talk.
There are numerous HIPEs that relate to this topic. Some of the key ones include:

<p><strong>silviu</strong> (Tue, 26 Mar 2019 14:28:20 GMT):<br/>
Hi everyone. I'm trying to build a concept for federated identity on blockchain. would Hyperledger Indy be the right one to do that or should I use another Hyperledger framework ? Any suggestions?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 26 Mar 2019 15:12:56 GMT):<br/>
@silviu  Indy would be the right choice...The channels are #indy #indy-node and #indy-agent, it would be worthwhile to look at the stack and the current state of development through the presentations on this channel to get a general overview before embarking on this. Where is this federated Identity being built? Can you share the thought process and the use case (if you can).

The Indy community is looking to name the new project proposal to split off the agent protocol (wallet, messaging and credentials exchange) project that has been incubated within Indy into its own project to help support standards compliance and protocol interoperability more broadly than just Indy (formerly known as Egalite and Envoy, which both had name issues). If you would like to help decide on the name, please respond to this survey sometime within the next 30 hours. https://forms.gle/5s879DB2Kp37DZYe7
I expect we will start discussing results over in #indy and in #indy-maintainers sometime Friday afternoon (US time) once most folks have had a chance to respond.

<p><strong>szewong</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 00:00:12 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB David won’t be joining. He feels he is not an “expert” on the subject. I will work on finding someone who can present in a future meeting.

@VipinB The Hyperledger Aries project proposal is now up on the wiki here https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Hyperledger+Aries+Proposal

I am a bit over-eager to get it in front of the TSC so that we can try and recruit contributors from Ethereum and other traditional identity systems at the Internet Identity Workshop and DIF meetings next week in Mountain View, CA
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 20:28:27 GMT):<br/>
@nage You are presenting this tomorrow, right? The name Aries stands then.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 20:37:40 GMT):<br/>
Yes.  I have a discussion scheduled with the Marketing folks after the TSC meeting to get their feedback

@drummondreed  will you be able to present May 1st, since it seems like it is the middle of IIW...
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Mon, 29 Apr 2019 20:02:06 GMT):<br/>
Vipin, good point, no, I thought you were referring the following week. Trying to dial in during IIW is nearly impossible. Better to report on it the following week.

<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Mon, 29 Apr 2019 21:40:53 GMT):<br/>
Ok, that sounds good. I wasn't planning on being at Consensus, but now it looks like I will be there at least one day.
</p>

Let us interact on email or chat about the Identity events and the paper.
We are canceling the ID WG call tomorrow.

</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Sun, 05 May 2019 23:30:31 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB I will be at Consensus (technically I will be a Construct) on Wed the 15th. Happy to attend an in-person meeting of the Identity WG there that day. I believe the talk I'm giving on Indy (and now Aries) is that afternoon.

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:26:30 GMT):<br/>
@drummondreed  we will have at least one call on the 15th (the noon call) will be delighted if you can participate.
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Fri, 10 May 2019 05:02:21 GMT):<br/>
Vipin, that will be right after the talk that Dan Gisolfi and I are giving on HL Indy—it runs from 10:30 to noon (the first 45 mins are another IBM person covering Fabric, then Dan and I are doing Indy).
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Fri, 10 May 2019 05:03:22 GMT):<br/>
So if we can get from that stage straight to a quiet place, we can do the call. Are you coming to our session? Do you have a place lined up where we can all do the call?

@drummondreed  I have to scope out the venue when I get there to find a quiet place. Since I will be on and off there from Monday we will find a spot. I will try to get to get to your session.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 00:23:32 GMT):<br/>
There will be no call on May 15th... Since I am at Construct 2019 and we cannot find a quiet place  to make the call. We will have the call on May 29th.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 00:23:32 GMT):<br/>

Roger that, Vipin. If you are available, let's have lunch at noon ET on Wednesday after the Hyperledger Indy session that I'm giving with Dan Gisolfi at 11:15AM ET (the session starts at 10:30 with a Fabric walk-through; the second half is an Indy walk-through).

@VipinB , the URI that you pasted appears to have an extra char in it (the trailing -) that breaks it. If you remove the -, it works.

I added a couple hyperlinks to the text. Looks great! I hadn't known about the CHAOSS effort to formalize metrics. That's cool.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 14:26:45 GMT):<br/>

The implementation work for identity inside of Hyperledger has gotten to a point where there is a significant amount of cross-project collaboration.  In particular we have a lot of Indy+Aries+Ursa discussions about API surfaces, release planning and use cases that has always been going on in the Thursday Indy WG call.  Since the nature of that collaboration now spans multiple projects with the three we mentioned, we are moving that call underneath the Identity WG's management and officially opening it up to all Identity Implementation work (we didn't want it to distract from the higher-level whitepaper or use case work already going on in the bi-weekly call we have now).   So if you're writing identity code for a Hyperledger project, or anything that intends to be interoperable with a Hyperledger project, please join us for the first Identity Implementers call next Thursday at 9 AM mountain time.  We will be discussing whether to have the call every week or every other week, and looking for any other working groups from the projects that would like to report status or discuss progress.

@here If you remember, we had Daniel Hardman present on this paper at an Identity WG call.
Created jointly by Daniel Hardman, Sam Curren & Daniel Buchner, the paper was well received during the call by the members of the Identity WG community. We also made several suggestions for improvement many of which were accepted by the authors. In addition Luca Boldrin contributed a diagram to this effort.

Please note that this is now jointly published on the Hyperledger website as well as the DIF site as a tech explainer.

https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2019/07/23/rhythm-and-melody-how-hubs-and-agents-rock-together 

This demonstrates our commitment to collaborate with DIF and speaks to the aim of the Identity WG to be a platform for open source practitioners in Digital identity. 

Congratulations to all who participated in this effort!.

Hi Fellow Community Members!

We, the folks from the BC gov VON (https://vonx.io) team, would like to share an opportunity with members of open communities to work with us to do some focused collaboration around mobile agent, Aries agents and aries-cloudagent-python interoperability. We have a pilot production service planned for a significant professional accreditation organization within our province coming up in the fall. This pilot has a requirement for mobile agents to be able to hold and offer verifiable credentials issued and verified by services operating instances of aries-cloudagent-python. Details are in this Open Collaboration MOU: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GPZ4p4zM36AN3DcHJ13s_IisSrT4F3S0 

More details around the use case and how we intend to work with the community are in the document.

Our offer is to work closely, in the open, with groups that we believe are close to having a releasable mobile agent such that their agent could be one of the listed compatible agents when this new service goes live. Our expectation is for the production pilot to occur this fall.

If you are interested and think you have a mobile agent that is close to release, please review this Open Collaboration MOU, and contact us via Hyperledger Rocket.Chat or via my email available in the MOU.

We would expect to have all participates identified with signed MOUs by Aug 6th 2019.

Progress of Identity Working Group paper. sticking points = rather than sticking points, might be good to identify completed sections, to narrow down and identify where to move on. Same thing; however, with identified completed sections I can do a final copyedit for readability and for appearance (spacing, headings, etc).

@here Notes have been updated see  https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/IWG/2019-10-16 for details

Notes:
Jan Lundqvist gave a teaser on the RFC Consent in Hyperledger Aries .

The paper consists of : 

An ontology - terms that are relevant and objects that are built up from these terms

Legal compliance standards
How can DID based systems implement a consent lifecyle
A reference implementation of a lifecycle
Consent certificate + proof
Process Flow
Jan says the paper should be properly called the enforcement of a Privacy Agreement
We spoke briefly of the following hard problems

Hierarchy of sharing (what if the original relying party (RP) sells or shares the information to another party) and so on?
Selective disclosure, granularity and quality of information shared (derived information like age boundary-i.e. older than x, younger than y from birthday)
Meta data harvesting (IP addresses, location) and creating correlations
Bankruptcy and delegation of control of privacy proof 
Forgetting: what sort of regulation should control this
Common themes and ideas around sovereign or multi-state regulations (like GDPR, India Consent Layer, CCA, New York state privacy, Chinese regulation on consent) and how to implement them, are there patterns code snippets libraries
Some techniques proposed on the Semantics call

Adding masking layers for psuedonimisation
Metadata turns up as machine readable quasi-identifiers- what to do about this
Jan agreed to do a demo of the reference lifecycle in a future meeting- we will publicize this and hopefully we will have greater participation.

Regarding the Identity white paper. We discussed looking at sections to consider 'complete' until final whole paper review. We discussed moving the Google Doc into Confluence. Shall I move it over or ? Due to a rapidly changing environment, rather than call it a white paper, is it more a snapshot of current interpretation. To be reworked once per year?

<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 20:52:37 GMT):<br/>
Hyperledger has a new process for managing calendars. Administators of the mailing list group have the right to create calendar appointments. I requested to become an admin so that I could migrate the Identity WG Implementers call to the new calendar. I also cleaned up the HTML in the main Identity WG calendar appointment. Hopefully that helps you out @VipinB .
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 22:02:31 GMT):<br/>
Also, we had a problem with the Zoom recording for the Identity WG Implementors call this morning, so while I moved the appointment between calendars I updated the Zoom room to one that Steve and I have host for.

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 10 Dec 2019 21:25:05 GMT):<br/>
Yes @drummondreed there is a call; I had followed the procedure that @esplinr outlined above; but about two weeks ago- Looks like it may not have worked . Have to check again
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 10 Dec 2019 21:26:11 GMT):<br/>

@here,

Please be aware of time change due to Daylight Savings time in the US (it becomes UTC - 4), an hour earlier for those that did not switch to DST.
The zoom channel is https://zoom.us/my/hyperledger.community
Time: 12 noon EDT (16:00 UTC) tomorrow the 18th of March
https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/IWG/2020-03-18

Events are always recorded: Audio and Video links always updated in notes.
Main event:
A talk by Daniel Bachenheimer (from Accenture) on KTDI (known traveler digital identity) from WEF (he will also give us a view of what went on at the WEF) and ISO TC 307 (Blockchain & Smart Contracts) (these standards are not freely available- you have to buy them).

You have to attend and listen to Dan, also ask him questions.
In light of the developing story on the Corona virus, a zoom call is the best way to keep in touch and be involved without compromising yourself.

Thanks,
</p>

Brajesh, I apologize for being so slow—the COVID-19 Credential Initiative has resulted in a wave of new work that has me behind on many messaging channels. The persons to contact to connect with the CCI are Jamie Smith (jamie.smith@evernym.com) and Alex Andrade-Walz (alex.walz@evernym.com). 
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 15 Apr 2020 14:50:43 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 15 Apr 2020 17:23:50 GMT):<br/>
@here Thanks @drummondreed @KellyCooper and others for a great discussion.
We had Drummond present on Covid Credentialing Initiative (CCI) and my presentation on contact tracing apps and their rapid evolution.
As noted it is not evident that DLT and Identity have any links to Contact Tracing, except for healthcare credentials. Remaining anonymous and contributing in a decentralized way has some relation to Identity. As we start seeing the rapid evolution of these apps, we need to see whether there will be touchpoints introduced to DLT and credentials.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 15 Apr 2020 17:26:29 GMT):<br/>
As noted we will be back to our regularly scheduled programming as well as more focus on CCI and deployment as we move forward into loosening the restrictions on total lockdown and awaiting to soften the second wave that is sure to come.

@here Call in an hour, as mentioned in email The main event will be a discussion on eIDAS legal framework.
Which will be run as follows.


Luca Boldrin on the background of this publication (the legal framework for eIDAS)

followed by Stephane Mouy outlining main points,

then Roland Faure gives one particular vision of this subject based on a  use case related to IAM for Dangerous goods transportation.



All of this brings us to EBSI, which we will present in the future. EBSI is the public blockchain framework for pan-European collaboration in the government sector.

There has to be interaction between EBSI and eIDAS.


We may also explore integration between startup architecture and EBSI.


All in all, promises to be an exciting call.


This will tee us up for future discussions on Identity as seen by the state vs across regions and internationally and how that helps stitch together the blockchain infrastructures, in terms of trust, KYC etc..

> The main event: Peter Somogyvari talks about the Identity solution in Cactus

@VipinB 
Very optimistic to call it the main event, thank you :-D
My usual disclaimer to manage expectations: nothing I'll say/show is a finalized design or any sort of commitment that it once will be (fellow Cactus maintainers need to reach consensus first but we haven't even started discussing it yet in detail). With that said, I'll be happy to talk about the things I've been working on recently. If anybody would like to check out the code or the relevant section of the whitepaper here are the links:
Branch: https://github.com/petermetz/blockchain-integration-framework/tree/feature/open-id-connect-web-service-plugin

The recordings and minutes are available at
https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/IWG/2020-06-24
Please correct or expand on the minutes. My apologies for my garbled zoom audio, although I could hear everyone just fine. Thanks again and we will continue to have great presentations on the IDWG.
Minutes

Christoph Schneider & Karla McKenna from GLEIF presented their project which went all the way from LEI registrars to an organization wallet that holds individual roles. In turn, to be presented in a limited way in GLEIF's public data.

Some of the questions

    the balance between privacy of the individuals in the corporations to the publishing of their  names in a public data source like the GLEIF
    the distance between the organizational wallets and the personal wallets to assert a claim on either salary or a position.
    the use of these org wallets as generic identification documents

Most of these questions were related to the scope and function of the org wallets vs VCs held by personal wallets.
Next steps: What is the roadmap for this PoC? Will it progress to a later version of Aries? What are the future plans for implementation?

Please check out our Agenda
https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/IWG/2020-07-08

The main event:

    Orie Steele from Transmute talks about his proposal for a universal wallet. Another exciting session brought to you by the Identity working group.
    From Orie's original email about the proposal:
    Repo: https://github.com/transmute-industries/universal-wallet
    Spec: https://transmute-industries.github.io/universal-wallet/

    The proposed specification will define a data model and abstract interfaces for digital wallets that store currency, credentials, key material or references to key material, meta data, and cards... The goal being to help unify DIDs, VCs,  and cryptocurrency wallet data models, by defining missing vocabulary or defining relationships between existing vocabulary, reusing existing specifications as much as possible without modification.... Including DIDs, DID Key, VCs, VC HTTP APIs, WebKMS, VP Request Spec, Presentation Exchange, etc...

Attend, ask questions and get answers from Orie.

Deepak Maram presents CanDID: a platform for practical, user-friendly realization of decentralized identity, the idea of empowering end users with management of their own credentials. While decentralized identity promises to give users greater control over their private data, it burdens users with management of private keys, creating a significant risk of key loss. Existing and proposed approaches also presume the spontaneous availability of a credential-issuance ecosystem, creating a bootstrapping problem. They also omit essential functionality, like resistance to Sybil attacks and the ability to detect misbehaving or sanctioned users while preserving user privacy.

CanDID addresses these challenges by issuing credentials in a user-friendly way that draws securely and privately on data from existing, unmodified web service providers. Such legacy compatibility similarly enables CanDID users to leverage their existing online accounts for recovery of lost keys. Using a decentralized committee of nodes, CanDID provides strong confidentiality for user's keys, real-world identities, and data, yet prevents users from spawning multiple identities and allows identification (and blacklisting) of sanctioned users. We present the CanDID architecture and its technical innovations and report on experiments demonstrating its practical performance.

Deepak is a PhD student at Cornell University and he is the principal author of this paper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/934 which describes CanDID in detail.

Zoom Channel = https://zoom.us/j/4034983298?pwd=STZQd0xMZU9xRVVOVnpQM3JNQ2dqZz09

The call is at 12 noon EDT (16:00 UTC) on Wednesday the 30th of September.
Minutes and Agenda at:
https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/IWG/2020-09-30

The main event:  a presentation on GADI (Global Architecture for Digital Identity) by Ramesh Kesanupalli, the CEO of Digital Trust Networks.
Please attend, collaborate, question, contribute!
We expect some members who are into pure SSI to show up and engage...

The mission of GADI is to establish a new trustable identity framework by providing a unique digital address to everyone.
The initial implementation uses Indy et. al.
We will have an extensive demo of GADI on a later call.

After the presentation we may have some questions:
How can GADI be used in Hyperledger Blockchain based applications? Provenance, Digital Finance, Healthcare, Digital Government?
What about correlation risk in the provision of a universal identity?
How useful is it for non-persons or Enterprises? What about IOT devices? Are there links to LEI?
Such identifiers are already part of many national infrastructures: SSN in the US, Aadhaar in India and so on. How will GADI interact with them?

@here The Hyperledger Identity Working Group announces a presentation on its bi-weekly zoom call: MyData Operators: a Nordic perspective.

By Lal Chandran, CTO, iGrant.io & Jan Lindquist Data Privacy Expert

Where : https://zoom.us/j/4034983298?pwd=STZQd0xMZU9xRVVOVnpQM3JNQ2dqZz09
When: *Oct 14, 12:00 noon EDT (16:00 UTC)*
Details:https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/IWG/2020-10-14

MyData operators are actors that provide infrastructure for human-centric personal data management and governance. There were 16 organisations awarded the inaugural status of a MyData operator, including iGrant.io. The MyData Operator 2020 Award recognises operators of human-centric infrastructure for personal data management and sharing. It acknowledges organisations that place the individual at the centre of personal data about them, ensuring that they are the prime beneficiary of the use of this data and providing tools to help them manage personal data.

Please participate, question, comment and engage!
Thanks,
Vipin

hi, I'm not really sure where to ask this question but I think this room is the most appropriate as far as I'm aware.  Are there any generalized taxonomies or papers on the types of workflows that have so far occurred with identities and VCs?

We had a great call with 65 people in attendance.
Drummond Reed gave an excellent presentation on "The State of SSI".
The presentation slides as well as the full video recording is available at:
https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/IWG/2020-11-25
Thanks to Drummond and all those who attended.

As part of the year end retrospective, it would be great to hear feedback from the members.
A retrospective is a guide to future activities.
To encourage more activities that people found useful, to abandon blind alleys, to embark on new projects.

Main Event
Darrell O'Donnell presents the latest advances in Digital Wallets.

Darrell is the thought leader everyone turns to for perspectives on Digital Wallets. Darrell wrote a white paper on Digital Wallets and now chapters on Digital Wallets in the SSI book edited by Drummond et. al. He will focus on how thought has advanced on digital wallets since his presentation to the group in December 2019. This is what happens in the IDWG, a tracking of iterative advances.
