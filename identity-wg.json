{"msg":"Message from @dselman  regarding identity implementation in fabric composer \"Composer manages participants and identities. Participants represent the people/orgs that are members of a business network. They are modelled and can be complex data structures, with relationships to other assets or participants. An identity is issued/revoked for a participant, and the identity <--> participant mapping is stored in world state by Composer. A single participant may have multiple identities. An identity is related to a single participant. The identity is stored in an ECert as an encrypted attribute, so that when a transaction is submitted Composer can retrieve the identity and through the identity-participant mapping table retrieve the associated participant. Docs: https://fabric-composer.github.io/tasks/identity-issue.html https://fabric-composer.github.io/tasks/identity-revoke.html .

The global installed base of trusted computing is where the keys can be made safe for a blockchain based attribute store and assure the quality of registered devices and the users they represent. Some of the hard problems like interpreted attributes with privacy can finally be addressed with the addition of strong device identity and verification of capabilities using attestation.

The document contains the following requirements\nRequirement 1: A user (“anchor”) shall be able to sign over its authorization over a smart contract to another user (“guardian”) after the fact. \n1a: The original user (“anchor”) loses its authorization over the smart contract.\n1b: The original user (“anchor”) maintains its authorization over the smart contract.\nRequirement 2: A blockchain consortium shall be able to sign over the authorization over a smart contract from one user (“anchor”) to another user (“guardian”).\nRequirement 3: It should be possible to re-assign the authorization over multiple or all a smart contracts for a user (“anchor”) to another user (“guardian”) in a single action.\nRequirement 4: It should be possible to re-assign the authorization over a smart contract back to the original (“anchor”) user.\nRequirement 5: The solution to requirements 1-4 shall not require the handing over of private keys.\nRequirement 6: The solution to requirements 1-4 shall not require mutability of the blockchain.\nRequirement 7: The introduction of a solution to requirements 1-4 should be backward compatible, such that they also apply to smart contracts that predate this introduction.\nRequirement 8: The solution to requirements 1-4 may be programmable.\n\nThe document has been developed in the Hyperledger RequirementsWG for a month now, and it is close to getting finalized. So this would be a good time to ask for your review.\n\nLooking forward to your reviews, comments and suggestions. Thank you!\n\nBest regards,\n\nOskar\n","username":"Oskar_van_Deventer","ts":"2017-07-05T09:03:17.655Z"}

{"msg":"This is indeed an important topic, and there is active work going on around this topic in Sovrin's community (AFAIK we don't have a WG around it yet, so ping @drummondreed if you're interested in getting involved).  The DID specification accounts for this through the use of additional keys in the control block.  You may have additional keys in that block that are allowed to do a key rotation under the right circumstances, and various different approaches are possible.  For a private ledger this process could be defined as some type of recovery transaction where the rest of the ledger agrees to update your key, but inside of Sovrin, we expect that identity service providers will compete for business based on what services they provide--including secure key recovery services.  We've talked about having identity escrow services, shamir's secret sharing schemes and many other approaches for having group consensus around rotating a key for someone who has lost their identity entirely.","username":"nage","ts":"2017-07-06T15:58:49.211Z"}

The solution it presents is ABC (Attribute Based Credentials)\n\nThese are rebutted to a great extent in the responses in the link posted by @jljordan_bcgov\n\nOne item that is missing from Blockcerts implementation, uPort etc. are the fact that public blockchains that were intended to be for crypto currency (in the case of Bitcoin) or World computer (in the case of Ethereum) both with underlying currencies that are highly volatile are used for the storage of Blockcerts and to ensure longevity. This is why a system like what Sovrin uses which is purpose built for Identity and supported by an Independent foundation could have a better chance of solving this particular concern. Of course they are also solving all of the other items mentioned like \"unlinkability\", \"Selective Disclosure\" etc. Hopefully we can also solve the Achilles heel of most of these systems which is private key loss or theft that can lead to total loss of ownership of your identity.

Hackathon is in Dublin Sept 30-Oct 1\n\n1.\tInteroperability with Legacy systems.  Extend the trust envelope to encompass Legacy systems used in the Enterprise\n2.\tUnlinkability- how does this operate in the Enterprise space, does it even matter? What about transactions and the visibility to participants.\n3.\tIntegrate ZPK or other methods to prove certain statements revealing as little as possible about the identity of the participants\n4.\tSelective Disclosure:  How can an Identity disclose the minimum (even to legitimate counterparties) to get our transaction done?\n5.\tInteroperability between chains and its effect on Identity.\n6.\tRevocation/Key loss, theft or removal of privileges and continuity of transactions. This can involve people getting assigned different roles.\n7.\tInteraction between public Identities (available on a self sovereign solution, like SOVRIN/Indy) and Identity on one of the Enterprise chains under Hyperledger.\n\nI would add\n-ID2020 - can it be implemented under Indy or some such DLT- create a small PoC to implement\n-How to make schemes like Aadhar more self-sovereign following the new legal rulings from Supreme court of India","username":"VipinB","ts":"2017-09-13T13:10:12.579Z"}

When I come to “Setting Up a CLI Client and Configuring the Agents in the Indy Cluster” and use vagrant to ssh into the cli01 host, and run “indy”, the “indy” binary is not found.  Infact, the “indy” binary itself doesn’t seem to be installed on cli01 or any of the validator nodes.  Other indy related artifacts are though.  Perhaps I’m missing something or the guide is out of date (although it was updated 11 days ago).

{"msg":"Hi all, I believe your next meeting is on Wednesday 30th so I will join per @VipinB 's invitation. \n\nHowever, I would like to comment my problem in advance.\nI'm trying to integrate main ETH with Fabric in a similar way as Parity is doing using Bridge smart contract between Main and Private ethereum. \nIn Parity, when an account wants to send back to main ethereum a token, the private nodes that form the blockchain sign a message and submits \nthe collection of signatures with the message to a smart contract in main ETH. \n\nIf the signatures are from predefined ETH address (or their public keys), then frozen tokens in main Ethereum are recovered back.\n\nI'm following a similar approach, in which I'm sending the signature of endorsing peers and using the payload of a predefined transaction as the message.\nThe problem is that each time the endorsing peers sign the payload, they are generating a different signature from a different private key.\nThis makes it impossible to validate in main ethereum if the signatures is from a predefined address. \n\nI believe this is because of the Identity Mixer imlementation in fabric, as per documentation I see:\n”Signing Transactions (Presentation). \nWhen a client (or possibly a peer) needs to sign a transaction, it generates a fresh unlinkable presentation token, which: \n1) signs the transaction content, \n2) proves a possession of a valid ECert issued by the CA, \n3) discloses the attributes that are required by the access control policy for the transaction.  “\n\nDoes anybody can help me figure out if this is possible to do?","username":"RodrigoAcosta","ts":"2018-05-23T19:20:36.191Z"}

The same effect can be achieved by creating a separate document and sharing with others. The same person had closed several resolved comments as well as reopened others.

{"msg":"Questions:\n\nHi, We, the Hyperledger Identity working group, is putting together a white-paper about the Digital Identity on blockchains. The target audience of this white paper are people who are just getting into the Identity world. I would like to ask the following question with regard to <Project Name>:\n\nIdentity based solutions such as Indy and uPort:\n1. What is the key differentiator of your Did/DDO solution?\n2. How is privacy handled? Where does PII reside in your solution and how is it protected? From correlation attacks?\n3. How do you address the “Username/Password” issue? Meaning people have to maintain too many passwords and the fact that passwords are not secure.\n4. How do you address interoperability with existing identity systems (LDAP and Active Directory)?\n5. What are the special features that make your solution fit well within a blockchain context?\n\nOther DLTs: Fabric, Sawtooth, Iroha, Quilt, Burrow\n1. How does your solution handle identity?\n2. How do you address the “Username/Password” issue? Meaning people have to maintain too many passwords and the fact that passwords are not secure.\n3. Does your solution address Self Sovereign Identity? If so, how?\n4. Does your solution address Distributed Identity? If so, how?\n\n","username":"szewong","ts":"2018-09-19T17:06:23.268Z"}

{"msg":"From the perspective of Mainframe?","username":"szewong","ts":"2018-09-19T17:08:03.703Z"}
{"msg":"Yes, so we're building decentralized identity into our desktop app, which is a \"launcher\" for decentralized apps custom-built to our platform's specs. The goal is to make it much easier for developers to create decentralized apps than it is today; if we bundle several services together, like decentralized identity, decentralized file storage, decentralized (anonymous) communications, etc. then it will draw more companies and developers to make their apps decentralized. So imagine a decentralized Facebook, or a decentralized Reddit, or decentralized Telegram--each of these are potential \"dApps\" on the Mainframe platform.","username":"canadaduane","ts":"2018-09-19T17:12:00.969Z"}
{"msg":"The goal of identity in this Launcher would be several: 1. to create a \"single-sign on\" experience (so you don't have to log in to each dApp separately), 2. to create an environment where you can keep your community affiliations & credentials no matter what dApp you're using (even outside our platform), and 3. to make it easy to interact across many different blockchains, networks, services, etc.","username":"canadaduane","ts":"2018-09-19T17:14:43.178Z"}
{"msg":"Lately we've been discussing another interesting \"wish-list\" item which is to make it so dApp developers never have to create a CAPTCHA again--i.e. wouldn't it be nice if there were a \"Certified Human\" credential that people could take with them. This is certainly possible within the SSI & verifiable credentials capabilities. But then there is a little trouble for the verifier--how do we know someone isn't creating multiple identities and then certifying each of them as Human? The verifier would need to create some kind of centralized list to make sure that John Doe hasn't signed up multiple times. Otherwise, \"Certified Human\" would mean nothing, because a single person could create multiple identities, get them each certified, and then hand them over to bots.","username":"canadaduane","ts":"2018-09-19T17:19:27.263Z"}

Also, evangelized on other SIGs and working groups to have cross pollination.\n\nThe Identity WG calls had a lot of discussion and two compelling presentations on DiDs and related technologies (SSI). Please look at the meeting notes and recordings to get a sense of the depth of the analysis, questions, connections drawn. We conclude that having two calls has increased participation. We will continue the two call format.\n\nWe invite Identity experts from all of the DLTs in Hyperledger and elsewhere to give their views and guide us in what Enterprises are expecting today as far as Identity Management systems go and their pain-points and their solutions. Also useful would be insight into actual use cases and their plans to integrate divided Identity systems.  \n\nWe will continue the two call format going forward; the next call(s) on the 3rd of April.\n- There will be a presentation on the India Community Group on April 1(sic) on the ID WG; \n- Updated paper is being driven towards a draft version.\n\nSuggested Agenda for the next call :\n\n1. Demo of universal resolver by DiF\n2. Convergence of solutions (DiF, Solid and others), how they affect us \n3. Layer 2 Identity protocols (for privacy of data and meta-data)- common effects\n4. Roadmap towards an Agent 2 Agent protocol\n5. Digital Wallets and their importance for Identity Management\n\n","username":"VipinB","ts":"2019-03-23T15:50:14.505Z"}

{"msg":"The implementation work for identity inside of Hyperledger has gotten to a point where there is a significant amount of cross-project collaboration.  In particular we have a lot of Indy+Aries+Ursa discussions about API surfaces, release planning and use cases that has always been going on in the Thursday Indy WG call.  Since the nature of that collaboration now spans multiple projects with the three we mentioned, we are moving that call underneath the Identity WG's management and officially opening it up to all Identity Implementation work (we didn't want it to distract from the higher-level whitepaper or use case work already going on in the bi-weekly call we have now).   So if you're writing identity code for a Hyperledger project, or anything that intends to be interoperable with a Hyperledger project, please join us for the first Identity Implementers call next Thursday at 9 AM mountain time.  We will be discussing whether to have the call every week or every other week, and looking for any other working groups from the projects that would like to report status or discuss progress.","username":"nage","ts":"2019-07-18T18:42:40.223Z"}

We have a pilot production service planned for a significant professional accreditation organization within our province coming up in the fall. This pilot has a requirement for mobile agents to be able to hold and offer verifiable credentials issued and verified by services operating instances of aries-cloudagent-python. Details are in this Open Collaboration MOU: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GPZ4p4zM36AN3DcHJ13s_IisSrT4F3S0 \n\nMore details around the use case and how we intend to work with the community are in the document.\n\nOur offer is to work closely, in the open, with groups that we believe are close to having a releasable mobile agent such that their agent could be one of the listed compatible agents when this new service goes live. Our expectation is for the production pilot to occur this fall.\n\nIf you are interested and think you have a mobile agent that is close to release, please review this Open Collaboration MOU, and contact us via Hyperledger Rocket.Chat or via my email available in the MOU.\n\nWe would expect to have all participates identified with signed MOUs by Aug 6th 2019.\n","username":"jljordan_bcgov","ts":"2019-07-23T23:20:02.610Z"}

The goal being to help unify DIDs, VCs,  and cryptocurrency wallet data models, by defining missing vocabulary or defining relationships between existing vocabulary, reusing existing specifications as much as possible without modification.... Including DIDs, DID Key, VCs, VC HTTP APIs, WebKMS, VP Request Spec, Presentation Exchange, etc...\n\nAttend, ask questions and get answers from Orie.","username":"VipinB","ts":"2020-07-06T18:00:49.861Z"}

{"msg":"@here Next call of IDWG Where: https://zoom.us/my/hyperledger.community\n\nWhen: Sept 16, 12:00 noon EDT (16:00 UTC)\n\nDetails: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/IWG/2020-09-16\n\nMain event is:\n\nDeepak Maram presents CanDID: a platform for practical, user-friendly realization of decentralized identity, the idea of empowering end users with management of their own credentials. While decentralized identity promises to give users greater control over their private data, it burdens users with management of private keys, creating a significant risk of key loss. Existing and proposed approaches also presume the spontaneous availability of a credential-issuance ecosystem, creating a bootstrapping problem. They also omit essential functionality, like resistance to Sybil attacks and the ability to detect misbehaving or sanctioned users while preserving user privacy.\n\nCanDID addresses these challenges by issuing credentials in a user-friendly way that draws securely and privately on data from existing, unmodified web service providers. Such legacy compatibility similarly enables CanDID users to leverage their existing online accounts for recovery of lost keys. Using a decentralized committee of nodes, CanDID provides strong confidentiality for user's keys, real-world identities, and data, yet prevents users from spawning multiple identities and allows identification (and blacklisting) of sanctioned users. We present the CanDID architecture and its technical innovations and report on experiments demonstrating its practical performance.\n\nDeepak is a PhD student at Cornell University and he is the principal author of this paper: https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/934 which describes CanDID in detail.\nPlease join the call and collaborate- ask questions, provide answers etc.","username":"VipinB","ts":"2020-09-14T19:01:19.908Z"}
