Hi everyone ! Im Ben (working Hyperledger Burrow) but very interested to keep the conversation we had at the Hackfest about a unified user story from Indy, Composer and Burrow permissions going. @nage suggested to do it here initially cc @sstone1

<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 27 Apr 2017 17:17:45 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam there are a bunch of common issues with Indy Agents, especially around the mechanisms for authorizations we have discussed (I think the binary formats being used by Burrow and Composer may be farther along here), and the idea of Swagger+EventedAPI specifications (where I think you're work may be helpful to inform where we are all trying to get to)
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Sat, 29 Apr 2017 19:00:46 GMT):<br/>
@benjaminbollen I just got back to Seattle from a long two weeks on the road, but +1 to working together here to develop a unified user identity story across all the projects. (Note that in Sovrin land we call it an *identity owner* since a person is only a "user" from the perspective of a particular system.)
</p>
<p><strong>cbruguera</strong> (Sun, 30 Apr 2017 00:29:05 GMT):<br/>
Sometimes when running an agent, a message such as the following is displayed in the logs:

Where are these keys being stored?

I've been having a discussion with @devin-fisher about how to check ATTRIB transactions. We're bringing it here so other community members can contribute as well..
</p>
<p><strong>cbruguera</strong> (Thu, 04 May 2017 22:45:07 GMT):<br/>
Basically, I have this agent method defined:
</p>
<p><strong>cbruguera</strong> (Thu, 04 May 2017 22:45:39 GMT):<br/>
```
def make_attrib_request(self, attrib):

    self.wallet.addAttribute(attrib)

    reqs = self.wallet.preparePending()

    return self.client.submitReqs(*reqs)
```
</p>
<p><strong>cbruguera</strong> (Thu, 04 May 2017 22:45:39 GMT):<br/>
```
def make_attrib_request(self, attrib):
    self.wallet.addAttribute(attrib)
    reqs = self.wallet.preparePending()
    return self.client.submitReqs(*reqs)
```
</p>
<p><strong>cbruguera</strong> (Thu, 04 May 2017 22:47:23 GMT):<br/>
(it's a method defined in my agent class)

The question, basically, is how to know this is actually working or not.

I've been checking a file named `test_nym_attrib.py` on sovrin_client/test, to guide myself..

In some places it looks like the way to check would be to invoke the agent's wallet `getAttribute` method, and then check if `attr.seqNo is not None`...

However, I just can't see where in the whole workflow is this `seqNo` being updated.

Of course the agent attribute is visible if I look into `agent.wallet._attributes` but seqNo is None, and I just don't know how to verify the attribute has been effectively recorded on the ledger or not.

I'm using `sovrin-client-dev=0.3.76` by the way, which is what I got from installing directly from sovrin-client master branch.
</p>
<p><strong>cbruguera</strong> (Thu, 04 May 2017 22:49:05 GMT):<br/>
I'm now checking a function in sovrin_common/util.py called `ensureReqCompleted`... If there are any other suggestions regarding this matter, or pointers on how is this utility function to be used, I'd highly appreciate it.
</p>
<p><strong>cbruguera</strong> (Thu, 04 May 2017 22:50:24 GMT):<br/>
By the way, this is an agent I'm just instantiating on the run in a test function. Does this agent need to have a "nym" registered on the ledger or something like that in order to be able to perform these transactions?
</p>
<p><strong>devin-fisher</strong> (Thu, 04 May 2017 22:50:35 GMT):<br/>
I don't know much about the client but this might help.
in sovrin_client/agent/walleted.py there is a function _sendToSovrinAndDo
which calls a utility function in sovrin_common/util.py called ensureReqCompleted
which I believe will check for a completed request.  Also, allows for a callback when it is complete.

But this is an example of mixing coding style between async and callbacks that I think makes the code confusing. I'm hopeful that we will improve this.

I don't know what permissions are needed to issue an attrib transaction.

also, this type of conversion would be better on rocket chat but I don't get notifications nearly as well on rocket chat for hyperledger.
</p>
<p><strong>devin-fisher</strong> (Fri, 05 May 2017 03:22:58 GMT):<br/>
We discussed on the working group meeting about setting up test environments. Couple of developers at Evernym have been working to make launching an Indy (Sovrin) network easier through docker.  We also have files for vagrant and AWS.  Anyway, they are contained in this github repo: https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-environments#sovrin-environments

I have not personally tried it but any feed back you can give (maybe through github issues) would help to make this work smoothly on as many environments as possible.

*Question:*

I know there's an ongoing development on http-based agent communication, as well as agent "extensions" over http (I more or less understand this is also related to Sovrin TLS somehow)... However, does it make any sense (or is it feasible) to work on ZMQ-based agent extensions?

I'm completely ignorant about how does ZMQ work, but I was just asking myself if that'd be too complicated since agent-to-node and node-to-node communication is already supported by this protocol.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 03:00:00 GMT):<br/>
@cbruguera There can be, but the advantages of using HTTP with DID TLS are pretty huge. If we can't pass by some of the technical hurdles, we'll have to focus on extension support within a messaging protocol like ZMQ.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 03:00:22 GMT):<br/>
Extensions will be supported in some way, as they are key to future platform development.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Fri, 19 May 2017 14:14:44 GMT):<br/>
Yes, @farooq_m_khan is investigating ZMQ based extensions now, but we are still hoping that DID TLS is close enough that we can leapfrog straight to the more universal approach

Hey @nage, @TelegramSam et, al. Sorry, I've been out of sync for almost couple months. Though that hasn't put down my Sovrin-enthusiasm! A question for you guys: so far we've been talking individual <-> organisation pairwise connections. Is there any reason why Sovrin couldn't be used for direct organisation<->organisation pairwise connections? IIRC Agents are agnostic to their "owner". Verifiable information and trusted communication interfaces are needed between B2B as well.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 12:19:08 GMT):<br/>
You are correct.  There is a lot of goodness to be had with all kinds of interactions between all combinations of people, organizations and things.

We expect exactly what you describe. Some agents will be very autonomous, and some will be mostly under direct control by their human(s). Our focus in designing agent communication is to allow any level of automation so that we don't inhibit future innovation and unnecessarily restrict what they are capable of.

Thanks @TelegramSam. The Sovrin whitepapers chiefly describes agents as something that you should not trust, but an agent built and deployed within an organization could perfectly well be trusted, right? And so such trusted agent could have access to the master key and hence the keyrings and encrypted containers? If so, is there any documents that describes the minimal set of required features / characteristics of such a trusted agent?

Agents can be trusted if their owners choose to do so--but we don't want the design to require such trust. Instead of having agents with master keys, we want agents that have delegated keys and limited authority. Have you seen this conceptual overview of agents? https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/wiki/Perspectives-on-Agent-Design

`docker-compose run sovrin-client-rust-test` but the `ledger_demo_works` test is failing.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=BxQaHH7W7Mh6JkjM8) Can you move this question to indy-sdk chat? Execution through docker-compose doesn't support tests that work with ledger now. You need to execute dedicated pool. It can be done with docker too.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=WJvLdjjMJ83jvEA8t) @danielhardman By the way, does the framework support delegated keys directly, or are those something that needs to be developed case by case?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 21:13:12 GMT):<br/>
The framework *allows* delegated keys. There is an academic paper about how delegated keys might work; it builds on BIP32 (used in BitCoin). See https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByMtMw2hul0EMFJuNnZORDR2NDA/view and https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/cfrg/current/msg09130.html
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 21:13:36 GMT):<br/>
However, there is not pre-built support for this featureset in the framework, only space for it.
</p>
<p><strong>peacekeeper</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 21:16:49 GMT):<br/>

Regarding @TelegramSam's report on using RSA keys in DID TLS for now, I wonder if there's some voodoo crypto that can seed an RSA keypair from an Ed25519 keypair, so that you wouldn't have to store a separate RSA key in your DDO and instead compute one in a deterministic way. Well nevermind, probably a really stupid idea.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 29 Jun 2017 22:09:10 GMT):<br/>
@peacekeeper That is a great idea, if we can get it to work. Better yet, just put the seed method into the DDO resolver for the method, so that the chain storage stays low.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 29 Jun 2017 22:11:36 GMT):<br/>
However it gets into the DDO, I want DID TLS to work with any key in the DDO, given library support for key type.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 29 Jun 2017 22:11:48 GMT):<br/>

We have implemented Agent API in indy-sdk. It is more less stable and available for wrappers developers.

@mhailstone: We had a meeting with @nage and @TelegramSam last week to go over what the conceptual diagram at BYU looks like
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:34:58 GMT):<br/>
... for us, we have organizations that are sister institutions of BYU that are owned and operated by the LDS church that we refer to as "CES" or "Church Educational System"
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:35:31 GMT):<br/>
... there is an organization called BYU Pathways Worldwide that acts as a broker of educational information
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:36:20 GMT):<br/>
... which leads to a concept of a student agent where a student can manage all of their educational content, credentials, and information about the student.  Then they can use this information about their educational experiences to interact with institutions and organizations outside of the scope of CES.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:36:45 GMT):<br/>
... this is a diagram about the scope of what we believe a student agent could be.  I have updated it relative to my conversations with folks here last week
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:37:16 GMT):<br/>
... you can see how we're thinking of storing various types of profile data, learning resources and claims so that we can manage access to the APIs and the data.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:37:45 GMT):<br/>
... we are hoping to incorporate these agent services into Sovrin and the hub with the indy-sdk, so we need to get more information on how the Agent-to-Agent communications and things work technically
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:41:24 GMT):<br/>
DIF Update: The Storage and Compute working group of the DIF is working on their spec for Hubs, which aligns with what we call Agents. They are working on permissions and profiles. We are involved and working towards common standards. Please ask if you have questions or want additional information.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:41:24 GMT):<br/>
DID TLS Update: (DID TLS is a project to use the existing TLS standards, but replacing CA verified certificates with certificates anchored to a chain. I have the server's (think agent's) chain cert being presented and verified correctly, and I'm working on having the client's (think calling agent) certificate verified against the chain as well.

@rajesh.kalaria showed a story that he is working on about agent versioning for API REST versioning
</p>
<p><strong>rajesh.kalaria</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:44:18 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:48:16 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam updated us on the DID TLS status
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:48:47 GMT):<br/>
@mhailstone mentioned a technology that they use for API versioning.  He mentioned that he's not sure how the first one affects his resources, but likes it up higher in the path
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:48:55 GMT):<br/>
... so that it doesn't affect your API resource design
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:49:28 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam would normally agree, but in the case of Agents if it goes higher than the DID in the path it forces version upgrades to revision the ledger's service pointer.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:49:56 GMT):<br/>
... which means it needs to go after the id, so that you don't require a DID update, and allows an agent to support multiple versions simultaneously
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:50:16 GMT):<br/>
... so perhaps agency.evernym.com/agent/id/12345/v2/auth
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:50:43 GMT):<br/>
@mhailstone so where would the DID point to in this case?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:51:17 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam so it would point to the base uri of the specific agent, but it depends on what you're versioning the entire agent or a particular extensible API
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:51:41 GMT):<br/>
... my inclination is that it would be better to version them seperately, so you could rev the Auth API without having to revision the unrelated APIs
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:52:11 GMT):<br/>
@mhailstone so in my mind auth would be a context or a base path of a service, and you'd be able to version them independently, rather than having to do them at the agent root.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:52:50 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam yes, it is useful to think of the agent as a collection of services rather than one complete system.  Which means you can have auth v1 and auth v2 running at the same time, while consuming clients are moving from one to the other
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:53:19 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman I was an advocate for the first of the three versions of these for a lot of the same reasons Sam articulated, but I've realized something that makes me question that:
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:53:31 GMT):<br/>
... which is you might actually need a solution for versioning that is broader than just HTTP
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:53:57 GMT):<br/>
... so if you want to talk to the same agent over HTTP and it also exposed some services over websockets or QUIC or another protocol, you're going to have the same issue showing up in other protocols
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:54:13 GMT):<br/>
... so I'm wondering if it is smarter to say that the version is expressed in the messages that get sent and not in the URL?
</p>
<p><strong>mark.hadley</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:54:23 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:54:35 GMT):<br/>
... There are some problems with that, because exposing versioning for the routing infrastructure is useful
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:55:31 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam any encapsulation where we provide a bridge with HTTP and message will have to account for the "PATH" or "URI" portion of the system, so having the versioning in the path should translate using whatever mechanism you use to translate that to the non-path based protocol
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:56:02 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman so your saying there is always some construct that maps to the path, and the version can always be expressed using that mechanism
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:56:17 GMT):<br/>
there was general agreement on the call for this approach
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:56:23 GMT):<br/>
(please speak up if you disagree)
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:56:42 GMT):<br/>
(or just have general feedback or comments you'd like to add)
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:59:12 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam inclusion of additional data shouldn't constitute breaking things, and it is good to be as lazy as possible in updating these versions (only change it if it actually breaks the message processing)
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 15:59:57 GMT):<br/>
... adding some additional information in the header or response about minor versions might be helpful, but if you're parsing things regular expressions or other bad processing techniques it might hurt you, but we wouldn't expect to have to protect you from yourself in those cases
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 16:00:28 GMT):<br/>
@rajesh.kalaria If we increment any version, that means it just affects that one resource, or do we increment the API generally?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 16:00:49 GMT):<br/>
... based on this discussion it seems like we can do the version of the affected resource and not the others...that is what I'm understanding
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 16:01:24 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam I'm a fan of revving the extension as a whole, rather than the individual resource
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 16:01:52 GMT):<br/>
... that being said we want each extension to be as small and modular as possible, so if they are dealing with multiple resources we could consider whether they are one extension or multiple ones
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 16:02:07 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman Every extension certainly needs to be versioned independently
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 16:02:30 GMT):<br/>
... because we cannot guarantee that extensions will comply with version statements you make about them
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 16:03:05 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam  I think versioning independently is the right answer and if sub-resources change it would trigger version changes at the extension level
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 16:10:52 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam and @rajesh.kalaria could you summarize the conclusions that come out of the bonus period of the meeting?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 17:02:50 GMT):<br/>
Sure
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 17:03:30 GMT):<br/>
An agent extension must be versioned if it includes any breaking changes to either it's arguments (expected input) or output.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 17:04:50 GMT):<br/>
A minor version can be used to record support for non-breaking changes, like optional attributes or extra information in either the input or output. This minor version should be present in the agent capability discovery to allow clients to understand availability for use.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 17:06:09 GMT):<br/>
@rajesh.kalaria did I miss anything?

telegramsam: it has been a good week and a half for DID TLS
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 15:06:43 GMT):<br/>
... we're trying to figure out what to do to make this work right away and into the future
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 15:07:04 GMT):<br/>
... I have some demos on how to make end-to-end DID TLS work, but there are some more decisions that have to be made
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 15:07:27 GMT):<br/>
... the server side of the DID TLS connection is fairly easy, by using the SNI hint for the DID you are connecting to
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 15:07:52 GMT):<br/>
... the slightly harder piece is for the client to respond to a certificate request and return a chain-anchored certificate, as the pattern is a little farther away from normal
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 15:08:14 GMT):<br/>
... in openssl's case if you request a client certificate there isn't a "self-signed" option (it hangs up if it isn't signed)
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 15:08:28 GMT):<br/>
... the goal is to make this work now so there are a handful of options for the workaround
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 15:08:47 GMT):<br/>
... the simplest is to just sign them with a CA, which is undesirable in the long term, but might be the quickest way to get started
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 15:09:13 GMT):<br/>
... other options include various forms of signing certificates that could be presented, but there isn't an asynchronous way to do that
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 15:09:24 GMT):<br/>
... so there may be a connection dance that is possible there
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 15:09:49 GMT):<br/>
... we're working through that to see how we can make it work in the short term with an outline of what fixes/changes would be needed in the long-term
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 15:10:06 GMT):<br/>
... this will allow us to have a mutually authenticated connection at the transport layer
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 27 Jul 2017 15:10:25 GMT):<br/>
... which should allow all sorts of peer-to-peer authenticated communication based on a blockchain

I have a few questions about the Getting Started scenario with Alice and Faber College.   Am I correct in assuming that the identifier from the invitation Alice downloads has been pre-assigned to represent Alice's "account" at Faber on Sovrin?  How does Faber know that Alice is who she says she is - would she have already authenticated with Faber through some non-Sovrin mechanism?  The guide mentions Alice's Sovrin app - would I be correct in assuming that this would be a Faber College specific application that supports Sovrin and that Alice would authenticate through that in order to obtain an invitation that is effectively tied to her Faber account?
</p>
<p><strong>jamesmonaghan</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 08:48:44 GMT):<br/>
the assumption is that Alice has authenticated out-of-band with Faber
</p>
<p><strong>jamesmonaghan</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 08:49:10 GMT):<br/>
maybe she has clicked a link in the Internet Banking application, and the invitation has been dynamically generated for her, for example
</p>
<p><strong>jamesmonaghan</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 08:51:57 GMT):<br/>
her "sovrin app" would likely be separate to the Faber app, and she could use it to manage all her sovrin connections
</p>
<p><strong>jamesmonaghan</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 08:52:34 GMT):<br/>
so she'd log in to her banking app like normal, see an option to connect using sovrin, and on clicking that link the invitation file is opened by her sovrin app
</p>
<p><strong>srottem</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 09:09:08 GMT):<br/>
Gotcha.  Thanks for the clarification.  So the identifier in the link request is the Sovrin identifier that Faber would link to their internal systems, yes?
</p>
<p><strong>jamesmonaghan</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 10:00:15 GMT):<br/>
alice responds to a specific invitation saying "here's the identifier i'd like you to use for me", and faber stores that against the account the invitation was generated for
</p>
<p><strong>jamesmonaghan</strong> (Mon, 31 Jul 2017 10:00:46 GMT):<br/>
in the GST these examples are pretty hard-coded, but in a real-world scenario it would all be dynamically generated

Slava aka @gudkov works on  the Indy SDK and will talk to us about what has been going on there
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:07:54 GMT):<br/>
gudkov: the python wrapper has matured and is now ready to start using.   Look at the wrappers folder for python and you can get started with it
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:08:01 GMT):<br/>
... we have plans to use it more in the python code base
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:08:25 GMT):<br/>
... we are also working on build pipelines to build libindy on Windows and the associated wrappers (for example the .NET wrapper, python and java)
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:09:05 GMT):<br/>
... in the previous weeks we've created pipelines to produce builds for the various wrappers.  We're going to continue adding Windows and Mac OSX and iOS platform support to the build system
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:09:24 GMT):<br/>
... we are also working on the creation of some installers to help do quick installs of libindy and wrappers on supported platforms
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:10:04 GMT):<br/>
... binary builds are published in the deb and rpm files in evernym's repo (@gudkov, please give a link)
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:11:02 GMT):<br/>
... for now we are doing this on the master branch, which can have some stability issues.  We will be making a stable release branch in the future where we will avoid anything that causes stability issues
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:11:30 GMT):<br/>
... it looks like we need pointers to these repos on our github documentation, I'll be adding those
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:11:40 GMT):<br/>
gudkov: also we started work on integration of DID TLS to our Agent API
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:12:01 GMT):<br/>
... we are also targeting getting that in over the next couple of weeks
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:12:21 GMT):<br/>
... so we should have automation of releases and a release branch and some release of libindy
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:12:59 GMT):<br/>
... there are few new features we want to provide: DID TLS, some changes in the way the node API works (serialization approach) and other fixes to keep things integrated with the changes happening on the indy-node side
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:14:00 GMT):<br/>
markus: there are improvements going on with the Java and .NET wrappers and they are in good shape
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:14:20 GMT):<br/>
... looking forward to getting everything to a release and keeping it all in sync with libindy
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:15:14 GMT):<br/>
doug: over the last week or so Sam has been building out a DID TLS specification doc
</p>
<p><strong>wightman</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:15:19 GMT):<br/>
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-aPY1eeHdR_TnF7_WpEs58RZ_jNdDeptVrNEu3groFc/edit?usp=sharing
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:15:33 GMT):<br/>
... it gives a good background on the spec itself and the effort to use DIDs for TLS authentication and encryption
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:15:58 GMT):<br/>
... the idea here is that in libindy we will be able to use TLS in addition to the CurveZMQ pairwise authentication
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:16:39 GMT):<br/>
... this work would happen in the Agent-to-Agent communication so that they can use certificates that are found on the ledger (basically self-signed certs) that can be traced back to the ledger for validation instead of root CA authorities
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:17:40 GMT):<br/>
... the doc goes into detail about using SNI hints and how we use that to transfer the DID information during the initial handshake
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:18:04 GMT):<br/>
... grab certificate information and resolve getting the needed information from the ledger DDO
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:18:44 GMT):<br/>
... going forward this enables simple REST interfaces and so many other systems that use TLS to plug into agents more easily
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:19:28 GMT):<br/>
... we have also been investigating the next steps for supporting this in the Agent API of indy-sdk
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:19:47 GMT):<br/>
... and there will be some changes to that API to support both protocols (DID TLS and Pairwise Curve ZMQ)
</p>
<p><strong>wightman</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:20:34 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/TelegramSam/DID-TLS
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:20:39 GMT):<br/>
... right now there are two experimental/reference implementations of how to do this on Sam's github
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:20:58 GMT):<br/>
... if you look there you'll see a python and a C example with a client reaching out to a server and specifying a DID in the SNI hint
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:21:28 GMT):<br/>
... the server resolves that cert if it has it cached, or looks it up and adds it to its local chain off the ledger if it does not have it
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:21:51 GMT):<br/>
... on the second try it should have loaded the cert into its cache and will correctly resolve the cert for the server and client side
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:23:06 GMT):<br/>
... some further work that needs to be done is to get the system to look for the certs from the ledger instead of just stubbing in the files
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:23:31 GMT):<br/>
gudkov: if I have an existing service where I want to just add an ssl layer over did tls, how could I integrate this into an existing service?
</p>
<p><strong>lohan.spies</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:24:12 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:24:39 GMT):<br/>
doug: short term the answer is probably no.  Short term we're looking at how to use sni hints to facilitate this.   The servers accepting the connections right now (if they are just using openssl) aren't going to be able to find the cert when they look it up (they have to chain it back to a root CA).   Long term we hope the library level could do that resolution (in something like openssl)
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:29:43 GMT):<br/>
nage: we would like DID TLS to be interoperable at the DID level so it can be used with others at DIF
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:30:17 GMT):<br/>
... also we expect that systems trying to integrate will need some agent smarts to handle the authentication and profile information associated with that connection
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:30:34 GMT):<br/>
mhailstone: why does it do the double-connect?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:30:50 GMT):<br/>
doug: when the system first gets a certificate from the client it doesn't know about that certificate
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:31:13 GMT):<br/>
... and the current libraries don't provide an opportunity to retrieve those certs during the handshake, but when it hangs up it can go look up the cert
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:31:27 GMT):<br/>
... so when you ask a second time it can know about the certificate
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:33:27 GMT):<br/>
nage: we aren't sure if it is a protocol layer issue or a library implementation issue, but doing this work around lets us support it immediately and then we hope to ask for the needed enhancements as it gets more adoption
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:33:56 GMT):<br/>
markus: would this work also for SSH?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:34:19 GMT):<br/>
... I have mentioned MonkeySphere, a project with a similar approach before.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:35:47 GMT):<br/>
nage: I think that would make a great project, and because SSH already does ed25519, it could make a really interesting enhancement.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:39:05 GMT):<br/>
... the common ssh client even has some type of integration layer that might work for this
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:39:05 GMT):<br/>
markus: the common ssh client even has some type of integration layer that might work for this
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:41:33 GMT):<br/>
mikebailey: if I attach to a pool with the CLI and the pool object, does it actually download the stats from the ledger I can data mine about (like verkeys and stuff) from that ledger object?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:42:12 GMT):<br/>
nage: this question might need to be directed to the indy-node working group as the developers of that part of the system hang out there
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:49:22 GMT):<br/>
nage: how do we help facilitate developers getting started
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:49:41 GMT):<br/>
_talked and folks asked very good questions and had good comments, which nage did not effectively capture for the notes_
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:51:57 GMT):<br/>
mhailstone: right now there aren't many markers pointing to jira, I need to go look there.  I look for good example tests and getting started info, so having that should help, and I'll look at jira to try to have more of an opinion on what we might need there
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:55:36 GMT):<br/>
lohan: which indy-sdk wrapper(s) are most mature or the best examples?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:55:51 GMT):<br/>
gudkov: most of them are equally mature, and there is good test coverage for all of them
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:56:09 GMT):<br/>
... the C-callable library is actually the target of the sdk itself, so rust isn't a good target
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:56:19 GMT):<br/>
... but the various sdk wrappers should all be pretty good
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:56:30 GMT):<br/>

</p>

lohan: is there any current implementation under development for node.js?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:57:35 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 10 Aug 2017 15:57:49 GMT):<br/>

i'm just scanning the mailing list and I see some overlap with something I have been working on - ethereum TLS integration using caddy + coredns + geth - the need is for a GraphQL and websocket wrapper bound to a contract.

</p>
<p><strong>ewelton</strong> (Fri, 11 Aug 2017 10:47:26 GMT):<br/>
@lohan.spies hi - plz use eric@korsimoro.com - is there any interest in a go wrapper as well?  That might be fun to plug into the caddy project - and a step towards broader adoption of DID TLS.

</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 24 Aug 2017 15:24:20 GMT):<br/>
... we ask the server to maintain an array of long term public/private keys, where each one is for a particular client
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 24 Aug 2017 15:24:31 GMT):<br/>
... when a new client arrives they tell the server which key they intend to use
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 24 Aug 2017 15:24:45 GMT):<br/>
... then the server can set the context and continue using the correct key to negotiate the channel
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 24 Aug 2017 15:28:02 GMT):<br/>
TelegramSam: the idea with DID TLS is to have a TLS based connection that provides encryption as well as mutual authentication
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 24 Aug 2017 15:28:21 GMT):<br/>
... the difficulties we have run into is that the implementations of the TLS spec make some things easy, but other things are quite difficult
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 24 Aug 2017 15:29:08 GMT):<br/>
... for example in server connections it is common to allow connections to self-signed server certificates, but no flags to do the same for client certificates (you cannot request one and not validate it in most deployed implementations)

TelegramSam: we are hoping to hide most of the cognitive load of these specs behind library code and methods that support developers integrating things into their own languages
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 24 Aug 2017 15:34:55 GMT):<br/>
... DID TLS hopes to be functional for agent-to-agent communication but also allow other TLS wrapped specifications to work
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 24 Aug 2017 15:35:28 GMT):<br/>
... right now the most successful peer-to-peer secure protocols are actually centralized, and the hope is that DID TLS would help us decentralize these types of systems
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 24 Aug 2017 15:35:55 GMT):<br/>
... it is a bit grand an ambitious in this sense, over time we hope we can make it much simplier

... I would love feedback about what is reasonable and not reasonable
</p>

Oh goodness - I missed this agent WG call.  I've been working on a node.js typescript wrapper and am working on writing tests now - following the lead from the other wrappers.  I understand we're still have a call this evening (my time) to discuss the formal status.
</p>
<p><strong>ewelton</strong> (Fri, 25 Aug 2017 02:08:05 GMT):<br/>
in addition, some of us here in Chiangmai are working on implementing something very similar to DID-TLS in the caddy stack with some pluggable CAs.  not exactly the DID-TLS spec (the rest of the team is uPort oriented), but similar.  I hope to bring that into the DID-TLS fold once we have a functional node.js wrapper

<p><strong>ewelton</strong> (Fri, 25 Aug 2017 17:58:09 GMT):<br/>

General Question: 
https://github.com/decentralized-identity/hubs/blob/master/explainer.md

would the API Routes proposed in the above draft be something that Indy-Agents would implement to be "DIF Standards" compliant?

Am I correct in putting Agents and Identity Hubs at the same level of abstraction?

<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 30 Aug 2017 09:00:25 GMT):<br/>
@jljordan_bcgov Yes, you are exactly right. In fact there's been a lot of discussion between the Sovrin and DIF communities about the two terms. "Identity Hubs" is more data-centric and static than "Agents", which does more to emphasis dynamic relationships and context. But yes, both terms basically describe the same thing: the endpoint that the DDO for a specific DID points to so you can interact with that identity owner.

<p><strong>srottem</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 14:06:10 GMT):<br/>
I've become passingly familiar with the Anoncreds part of the SDK but I'm still completely unclear on how credential attributes are constructed (e.g. 'sex': ['male', '5944657099558967239210949258394887428692050081607692519917050011144233115103']).  I'm told that the construction of the hex part of this value falls out of scope of the API but would like to get a handle on how construction of these values this would normally be approached since I assume I would need to know this in order to create an agent.  Is this an appropriate subject for discussion?
</p>
<p><strong>gudkov</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 15:39:28 GMT):<br/>
For example In python:

```
'male'.to_hex()
```
</p>
<p><strong>gudkov</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 15:41:05 GMT):<br/>
For java something like:

```
import org.apache.commons.codec.binary.Hex;
String hexString = Hex.encodeHexString(myString.getBytes('utf-8'));
```
</p>
<p><strong>gudkov</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 15:41:55 GMT):<br/>
The only restriction is that all parties must be agreed on this hex encoding.

@Sean_Bohan  - re: your request for Indy Agent topics.  Would this work?

We've been working on the "Verified Organization" concept, and the delegation of authority around identity from an organization to the people that act on it's behalf. We're trying to wrap our heads around it with varying levels of success :-).  Attached is a link to a use case that we've fleshed out that we would love to talk about.

@TelegramSam I'd like to address the role discovery scenario you were speaking to. Instead of introducing role definitions, could we discover/read Agent services in terms of Swagger paths for what is possible to perform on the agent service and then the managing agent (the food truck) could verify that the individual has authorization to perform certain services on the Health Authority? Basically, use REST service definitions instead of roles.
</p>

A Proof request on the Taco Agent could determine whether Bob is authorized to perform some action.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 16:08:14 GMT):<br/>
@mhailstone even more generically, each agent extension could designate it's own paths/permissions, and the permission slip claim can specify those specifially.

Quick question, yes-or-no, before I pull the trigger. I have a sovrin client node running (with some modifications I want to keep for testing), and a node pool where at least one node did not come up. If I shut down and restart the (docker containers of the) node pool, am I going to lose the client container as well (as far as connectivity to the node pool is concerned)? Or are will the client node reset connections to the nodes on the pool?

Hello,
I notice that in the Alice Garcia story, agents (faber, acme, thrift) have public (encryption) keys ('5hmMA64DDQz5NzGJNVtRzNwpkZxktNQds21q3Wxxa62z', 'C5eqjU7NMVMGGfGfx2ubvX5H9X346bQt5qeziVAo3naQ', 'AGBjYvyM3SFnoiDGAEzkSLHvqyzVkXeMZfKDvdpEsC2x'). If I create a new agent, from a design point of view, are these public (encryption) keys attributes of the wallet or the agent itself? How do I query my new agent's public key?

Or are the public (encryption) key and the verification key actually the same key?

Question: To initiate an interaction between two identities (e.g. Alice and Faber), a user might click a link on the web site of the other (or scan a QR code).  What are the expected attributes of the that link?  I'm assuming it is a URL of a type that will invoke the (Alice's) Client. For establishing a connection, I assume it’s the DID of the identity (e.g. Faber), but is there any documentation about other ways it might be used - e.g. to trigger a proof request/response interaction? Is that documented anywhere?

<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Fri, 08 Sep 2017 23:16:01 GMT):<br/>
@sklump , to send the ATTRIB you must be the trust anchor associated with the agent.  So, in the CLI, you should first establish your identity: "use DID xxxxx", where xxxxx is the DID of the trust anchor.  Then you can send ATTRIB
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Fri, 08 Sep 2017 23:25:01 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran , typically an invitation to connect will contain at least an identifier of an agent and a nonce.  Using the identifier, the client will be able to get the public key, the IP address, and the port that the agent communicates on, so it will be able to connect to the agent and establish secure communications.  It can then pass the nonce that was provided in the invitation to the agent.  The agent could use this nonce for context, and begin communications with the client, providing a claim, requesting a proof, etc.

<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 14:56:15 GMT):<br/>
Hello - I'm trying to build an agent to work into the Alice story. Is anyone familiar enough with the agent code to know how to query an agent for its public (encryption) key -- the one that gets written to {name}/public_keys/{name}.key, z85-encoded?
</p>
<p><strong>srottem</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 15:45:32 GMT):<br/>
I think the idea is that when calling the indy_agent_connect method the 'receiver_did' parameter will be used to look up the values from the open wallet specified by the 'wallet_handle' parameter.  If the keys aren't there then they will automatically be looked up from the ledger in the open node pool specified by the 'pool_handle' parameter and the obtained information will be stored in the wallet.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 15:47:47 GMT):<br/>
Sure, great, but the endpoint has to end up on the distributed ledger in the first place, with address (known) and public key (magic value). Without the public key, I don't see how it is possible to bootstrap the agent in the first place.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 15:50:02 GMT):<br/>
At present I'm in the guts of the code that deploys to the docker sovrin environment. Ultimately I suppose I will be using the python wrapper.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 15:50:41 GMT):<br/>
I haven't got that to pass its anoncreds unit tests since v1.0.0 dropped, and am punting on that for the moment
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 15:50:52 GMT):<br/>
(it's probably something I did)
</p>
<p><strong>srottem</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 15:56:03 GMT):<br/>
I've got no expertise on the python side, but in the Java and .NET wrappers there are some demo tests that do a pretty good job of explaining the steps - see AgentDemoTest in the test project of the Java project.  In the meantime I can probably outline it; indy_create_and_store_my_did can be used to create a new DID into a wallet.  The DID then needs to be recorded to the ledger using a NYM request  - the request can be constructed using the indy_build_nym_request function and then submitted to the ledger using the indy_sign_and_submit_request.  After that the DDO needs to be recorded tot he ledger which can be done using an ATTRIB request which can be built using the indy_build_attrib_request and then is also submitted to the ledger indy_sign_and_submit_request.
</p>
<p><strong>srottem</strong> (Tue, 12 Sep 2017 15:56:30 GMT):<br/>
Hopefully I've got this right - I'm a contributor, not one of the core team so I could be off base. :)

PS - I've found my immediate error -- I had been using the `verkey` instead of the `full_verkey` attribute of `DidSigner`. A five-liner to get the public key from the seed follows:
```
from sovrin_client.agent.helper import friendlyVerkeyToPubkey
seed = b'seed0000000000000000000000000000'
signer = DidSigner(seed=seed)
full_verkey = signer.full_verkey
print("Derived public base58-encoded key is [{}]".format(friendlyVerkeyToPubkey(full_verkey)))
```

Indy Team Priorities Doc
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:04:45 GMT):<br/>
Prerequisites - graduating from Incubation
bootstrapping secondary agent protocols
Ledger monitoring work (NodeWG)
Verifiable claims DID support and revocation
Item - showing up - token work
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:04:55 GMT):<br/>
will discuss Token work at end of call
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:05:06 GMT):<br/>

Questions? Pls post in rocketchat channel #indy-agent 
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:06:23 GMT):<br/>
Alex:
Last 2 weeks, next two weeks
finished implement of state proofs and bls sig support

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:06:30 GMT):<br/>
code in Master and Indy SDK and Py CLI
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:07:23 GMT):<br/>
work in testing (QA)
also 1 more thing related to this - going to introduce a concept of prootocol version for Indy Node and for client to Node communication
required for backwards compatibility
expect changes / evolution in how we send data requests, structure - need to have a way to support quite old clients with new nodes

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:07:57 GMT):<br/>
some kind of backwards compatibility
if client is old, and sends outdated format, latest pool should understand and reply with JSON
protocol version
work in progress, supported in INDY SDK
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:09:40 GMT):<br/>
Why? new state proof feature
to be back-compatible with old clients that dont support state proof, so old clients can get replies from pool and new clients can use power of state proofs and mutli-sig
as for other things on node side - working on incubation task
finished rebranding, all code use correct INDY branding instead of SOvrin
CI and CD parts of pipelines are split, what is left, is to integrate CI into Hyperledger infrastructure
so any PR someone sends are public for all
another task - related to incubation
file folder refactoring
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:10:05 GMT):<br/>
write data (ledger, state) not in Home but in LibIndy (better for services running on ubuntu)
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:11:01 GMT):<br/>
related tasks, factoring of config files, as of now config can be messy, would like to make correspondent changes
in this sprint will be able to finish bug fixing related tasks, main goal, release candidate have a portion of incubation tasks and state proofs for next stable release
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:11:06 GMT):<br/>
Nathan - any questions for Alex?
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:11:38 GMT):<br/>
differences in how the nodes work, if you dont und the context, please ask
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:13:07 GMT):<br/>
Darrell - verbal with no visual issue
Nathan
when we have demos, we do somethign with a visual or slide with how the new change works
status updates - haven't gone that far
Darrel - amazing memories, without looking at notes
Nathan - Jira.hyperledger.org, Active Sprint, tickets in there, more context

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:14:33 GMT):<br/>
SteveT - maybe during status updates, if issues are in a sprint, share a screen and highlight tickets?
Nathan - seems like a good idea
Alex - demos for ledger workig group at end of sprint - chance to show some demos

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:16:05 GMT):<br/>
Slava:
Goals - state proofs in Indy SDK
done and merged to Master
versions of node protocol in a couple of days, finish until the end of the sprint
implemented bug fixes in anon creds
for now - better crypto and performance also bette
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:16:45 GMT):<br/>
easier to perform key rotation
improved pipeline
implemented few helpers in Indy SDK with workflow
storing wallet info for Pairwise connections
set meta data to pairwise connections
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:18:03 GMT):<br/>
daemon related to funct. at end of Sprint
New approach to Agent-to-Agent comms
can't shaare details right now as active dev and design, final vision in discussion
approach in SKD, most probably in the next sprint
also working on incubation tasks, plan to move outside pipelines to HL infrastructure and hope to finish end of sprint
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:18:32 GMT):<br/>
Questions?

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:19:37 GMT):<br/>
Nathan:
All items discusse dwere in active sprint for LibIndy
Alex talked about things in active sprint that are in the core of Indy
please take a look, a lot of tickets could use your help
Commit some code to INDY!

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:20:34 GMT):<br/>
More interesting developments in the standards space and future work
Slava mentioned Agent-Agent communication design work 
Answe questions about that - chance for Slava or Devin to discuss motivation or goals
what or why adding API for agent-to-agent comms

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:22:04 GMT):<br/>
Devin:
For us at Evernym looking to standing up actual agents, Agent WG implementing them, looking and wanting to make sure control remains with the identity owner and keys need to stay on devices they control and agents act on the users behalf
looking at how we could have keys remain out on the edge and not an agents-side, the design and discussion to modify design so agent worked on behalf of ID owner without holding the keys

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:23:56 GMT):<br/>
want to make sure the self sovereignty of an ID on Sovrin remains, but provide funct. on surface they get value from it
Alice needs  to own and control the keys, Bob has a similar need, have keys to know agents are authorized by their owners, auth continues to be up to date and valid (Alice revokes access by agent use case) - needs to be some auth of that agent
Accomplished thorugh intermediate or signed key (TLS world) also working on a channel where agent can act on behalf of owner without sacrificing exclusive control over keys
 
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:25:39 GMT):<br/>
CURVEZMQ not providing additional features or credential handshaek
moving forward - ideas around how it might be better with some advanced use of TLS and stuff, building it into the actual message
CurveZMQ becomes transport
HTTP is a more common  transport
Not sure we have a good diagram for showing that message wrap-protocol

Nathan - we dont, in 2 weeks with next Agent WG call, Slava can be on the call and describe the over the wire protocol and describe how it works

Matthew H
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:26:51 GMT):<br/>
looking at diagram was helpful
wallet or client, interaction of agent services, inside client is wallet
agent then, must use some other service and interaction to say "yup, valid agent of ID owner, interaction of protocol" - client has own interaction with the ledger, agent also has the ledger client - thats the other the interaction th agent has with ledger as well

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:28:50 GMT):<br/>
Nathan - both client and agent can interact with ledger to prove claims and proofs of the parties hasnt been revoked (owned by Alice, her Agent, associated by those keys)
Agent doesnt have to gain access to keys in all cases, if Alice has signed a proof that says "trust my agent" then bobs agent should rely on that proof that came from Alice

DanielH - similar to UMA2.0 in a diff way - auth check in the form of a claim rather than a token, claim still valid, etc. Dont have to have direct interaction with ID owners client in all cases if claim is still valid and claim is checked on the ledger
</p>

<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:28:56 GMT):<br/>
Nathan - correct
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:31:16 GMT):<br/>
SamC - understand presenting proof across the wire
What mechanism are in play to prevent replays of those creds? what types of binding or other things in play? fall back to same handshake a la nonce-signing?

Nathan - way anoncreds is built, create nonces for protocol, use them for blinding of secrets involved, prevent replay attack
in particular, need ot be careful - not a strong binding to comms channel, protocol could be across multiple, some things you might consider (cookie hijacking, packacge injection)
if anyone wants to help with investigating shape of that protocol please let us know

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:32:47 GMT):<br/>
not using transport player to bind credentials

Nathan - indy anoncreds doc folder, 3-4 papers describe it, details are in there but not easy to parse or understand, Nathan can connect anyone with questions with someone who can get up to speed
no API-level description of documentation

SamC - running into similar issues making DID Auth a thing
not just Agent-Agent - but generic auth

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:33:20 GMT):<br/>
Nathan - may be additions with token binding, binding transport layer to token, b/c you have strong binding with identifier or DID itself, we need to know the shape of that
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:34:27 GMT):<br/>
will put the link here Matthew

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:36:05 GMT):<br/>
<Stephen Surren brought up a use case and I didn't get it recorded)
Nathan - good use case for why agents need auth by identity owners
exactly the kind of creds to give to the agent to auth
not only agent, big co, govt agency has been authorized to talk to you on the govt' behalf

Darren - acting on behalf of the Org Book hiddent behind the scenes agent other registries talk to
auth agents 
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:37:18 GMT):<br/>
Stephen - small company wants to delegate roles, permissions, claims around employees of the company
got to be perceived by the person they are talking to as an organization
org needs to control how to do things
5 accounts, 5 govt orgs, roles and permissions - "we fired dave" - Agent should remove Dave from having access claims company agent has and you are done

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:38:14 GMT):<br/>
Nathan - whatever the root ID of the org can revoke any creds it has access to
can give Dave access in any context where they trust that cred, go back and say " revoking now" and strong assurance
any checking endpoint to endpoint can validate that has been removed from the ledger

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:38:45 GMT):<br/>

Any other Questions?
Stephan Curran - grappling with Wallets, have a claims store in their use case, entitit that will hold claims about many subjects
not like a person having their own wallet
is the wallet part of the SDK and abstracted away or can they access claoims to persist in their own way and use SDK to exchange claims as necessary, where does the wallet come into play
Nathan - SDK provides wallet API - inteface - any implementation of an agent can provide its own implementation of a wallet in place
different enterprises, want to keep data where it is already being managed and correctly as opposed to making a diff wallet it is more secure to use what you currently have and business processes have been thought through

Symon - some wrapper implmentations have incorporated wallets

Nathan - default is simple (Sql Lite) moving to  Sql Cypher

Nathan
Token work, merge requests, make new implmentations possible in agent space
Lot of relevant standards work on DIDs, etc.

Token work - to prevent spam in the system, helpful if there is cost to posting transactions to the ledger

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:45:17 GMT):<br/>
investigating idea of spam protection, tokens can be solution to lots of interesting things
Need to make sure the token doenst undermine privacy
one time use of token - same types of tech that backs anoncreds does 1-time transfer of secrets, you can mint value on a ledger, declare it exists and what it represents, can have token owned without revealing owner
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:48:44 GMT):<br/>
credit card network with access to info and data flows, selectively disclose info if somone is willing to pay for it, may charge $.001 if a transaction is risky, willing to sign info 
simple as university transcript, Uni charges money for , value transfer occurs on the ledger in privacy preserving way
value transfer between parties, issue can give data to a holder an dpresent proof to relying party and relying party can exchange tokens to get access to the data, gives issue incentives to issue to share in order to get paid (by users sharing creds)
in the process of vetting out the crypto required to do that and add right hooks into system to ask for tokens to pay for validator nodes, prevent spam, allow hooks to make claims and proofs exchange can require token exchange for premium claims or proofs
other piece - new project proposing to be included in HL called INTERLEDGER - atomic value exchange between ledgers
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:49:40 GMT):<br/>
reviewing code from Lovesh or Dmitry, see new code reorgs to make these constructs possible, work coming in the next few months
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:50:51 GMT):<br/>
Questions?
Matthew - discounts for Stewards for tokens?

Nathan - not privy to how we are minting tokens, or distributing - right people to get in touch would be timothy, or trustees on Sovrin foundation

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:51:50 GMT):<br/>
MatthewH - sugggesting is to protect against spam, stewards are resp players on ledger, not create bad claims and dirty up, they are reliable, give them a discount, proven to be responsibel


Nathan - we want stewards who run validator nodes to be rewarded for doing work as part of their effort

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:54:23 GMT):<br/>
Darrel - overall incentives for all players - goal is to be fair and make sense (refugees who can't pay, to groups who are paying )
themes discussed - if you look at bitcoin or ethereum, cost of transactions so high, want to have incentives so it doesn't happen

<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 15:56:58 GMT):<br/>
Nathan - DID Support
Changes to DID spec
housed in W3C community group, github repo for that spec, different ledgers using that spec
folks locked in a room, hashing out difference for how each can use and leverage to make things work well
held off on implementing DIDs in JSON format
DID Spec as written, using DID support to help move anoncreds move to something compliant with the W3C WG initiatives
suggesting changes so our anoncreds can meet that spec
plug into either effort (W3C Credentials Community Group) or following W3C Ver Claims WG mailing list
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 05 Oct 2017 16:00:20 GMT):<br/>
Darrel - how radical will changes be at SDK level?
Nathan - mostly on the wire serialization
some blocks of JSON we pass to those calls, we may change a little bit, will ask for feedback from this group to see how much they are depending on old formats and see if we can drop old and move to new
push all to more standards compliant versions without dealing with the old stuff
other format - speak up -
Darrel - on our side - planning on churn in data format
more consistent more easy

Folks, I just read the notes above (sorry I couldn't make it - have been helping put on the DHS Blockchain Workshop in DC) and the good news is that, while the DID spec will be changing a little, most of it will be to make the underlying RDF graph model consistent and extensible everywhere in the same way. The net effect will be relatively small - as Nathan says, it will be mostly in the JSON-LD serialization.

</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:25:31 GMT):<br/>
Sovrin and Hyperledger are both members of DIF, and the group has made a lot of progress on this Universal Resolver
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:25:54 GMT):<br/>
Markus created a blog post with a preview of the universal resolver.  The idea is to have a tool that resolves DID
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:26:21 GMT):<br/>
DIDs are a fundamental building block for self-sovereign identity used to refer to individuals, organizations and things
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:26:30 GMT):<br/>
and they can be resolved to a particular thing
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:26:56 GMT):<br/>
they contain cryptographic information, service endpoints, or basically the data you need to talk to the entity that owns this identifier
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:27:11 GMT):<br/>
each method that supports DIDs has different advantages and disadvantages
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:28:11 GMT):<br/>
this means you can have verifiable claims or agents that communicate between identifiers that are on different chains
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:33:12 GMT):<br/>
peacekeeper: the universal resolver will do all the hard work to resolve the did according to the method specification
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:34:27 GMT):<br/>
... in some ways it is very easy to do if the ledger supports the format natively.  In others, like btcr, when the document isn't on the ledger or anywhere else really, the did document exists in a way that has to be deterministically constructed from the information on the ledger and elsewhere.  In this case btcr puts the essential key information on ledger, and the driver follows standard references to retrieve the rest of the information, verify integrity and then return the constructed document.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:34:48 GMT):<br/>
... in some cases the driver might run a full ledger node to get all the information, in other setups the driver may just call another remote web service
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:34:57 GMT):<br/>
... there are different options with different trust implications
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:35:11 GMT):<br/>
... this is an "early preview" if we can call it that
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:35:23 GMT):<br/>
... there are drivers for six different did methods
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:35:46 GMT):<br/>
... I can't do a demo without my screenshare, but it isn't working from the linux box right now
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:36:13 GMT):<br/>
... we have a docker compose file that builds the java implementation of the universal resolver and assembles and orchestrates the individual drivers and launches everything locally
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:36:29 GMT):<br/>
... using the curl commands you see here you can resolve different DIDs 
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:36:42 GMT):<br/>
... whatever did you pass in, you get the corresponding did document
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:37:07 GMT):<br/>
... there are a lot of changes going on in the did specification right now, and they all implement different formats of did documents right now, and we're working on resolving those differences now
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:37:31 GMT):<br/>
... we are working to figure out what kind of process and versioning we'll need here to ensure the returned values meet the right format
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:37:41 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for the overview Markus!
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:37:57 GMT):<br/>
Sean: any questions about what this is, or where it is going in the future?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:39:50 GMT):<br/>
peacekeeper: the idea is to build a counterpart to the resolver called a registrar that would add an identifier to a ledger
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:40:07 GMT):<br/>
... there are more parameters and possibly manual steps by the identity owner to prepare these types of calls
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:40:20 GMT):<br/>
... for example agreeing to an identity owner agreement and finding a trust anchor on sovrin
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:40:39 GMT):<br/>
... or registering on bitcoin's chain costs bitcoin that needs to come from a wallet
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:40:57 GMT):<br/>
... there is some text and design materials starting to come together here, but it will take more time
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:41:33 GMT):<br/>
johnjordan42: we are going to try to use this resolver, and we now have a working early agent and successfully done agent to agent communication and verified and issued claims
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:41:49 GMT):<br/>
... we had to write our own did resolver, which we are now talking to DIF about
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:42:01 GMT):<br/>
... we want to use this resolver for the proof of concept we're working on
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:42:14 GMT):<br/>
Sean: any updates in Rocket.Chat are very welcome
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:42:22 GMT):<br/>
... any more comments or questions for Markus?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:42:29 GMT):<br/>
... The next item is the roadmap for Indy
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 02 Nov 2017 15:43:13 GMT):<br/>
@here please add what you want to work on to this roadmap and jump into the sprint process if you're working on any core functionality for Indy or Sovrin

The third slide says "Indy Universal Resolver".. Is this the DIF Universal Resolver we talked about today, or something else?

<p><strong>nage</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 18:09:22 GMT):<br/>
I think the answer there is we're not entirely certain.  It is likely the DIF resolver for now, but should we consider adding some sort of universal resolver functionality into indy-sdk?  It might be worth considering, though we'd likely want to do it in a more native c-callable way.

Thanks @mgbailey ! I will check the docker option today, thanks for the alternative.
</p>
<p><strong>sreekanthn</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 00:28:04 GMT):<br/>
The docker based setup worked fine for me on Macbook Pro; this one was really smooth to get up and running. @mgbailey  Thanks a lot for the help !

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:19:49 GMT):<br/>
TPAC Update
Member confidentiality but here is what we can say
F2F meetings on VerClaims very productive
JSON linked Data model doesnt work for selective disclosure
in person meetings able to describe how pieces work, get buy-in from community supporting data model for selective disclosure
open invite to make PRs to W3C community to make changes
Lot of interest and broad support for privacy preservation in DIDs in respect to community group
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:20:23 GMT):<br/>
more momentum there to take pieces and put into standards track items
lot of interesting things going on, support for things so far
aware of community group for HTTPS- Local
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:21:13 GMT):<br/>
participants from electronics manufactrers
similar needs to what we need for DID TLS
IETF task group working on STAR PRotocol - will 
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:22:57 GMT):<br/>
lot of support for fixing dns
layer or mech to own layer via DID would be valuable
not a real strong pref if that piece of the ecosystem needs to be TCP
might move into IETF area, how standardization might proceed
DIDs and identity based interactions at W3C is very web centric

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:23:18 GMT):<br/>
name might resolve to DID and then IP address
Standards more web-like, or webby is being thought about

good group, fun to put faces to names 
overall a lot of interest in Indy - people referencing it
known in hyperledger community
talking about

<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:25:44 GMT):<br/>
opportunity to spend time with ChrisF and original contribs of FABRIC (HL's first?)
talked about how he was doing experiments with indy on top of fabric, provide identity solutions inside fabric
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:26:12 GMT):<br/>
avoid having every ledger in HL build their own ID - why they approached Indy
first day - use cases
second day - tech issues

<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:27:26 GMT):<br/>
uses - Fintech still dominates a lot of the discussions
Interesting panels on asset security, using it for regtech, logisitics
using in china for small and medium enterprise loans to connect processors in fin sector and regulators
panel on privacy 
Dave Huseby was moderator
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:28:34 GMT):<br/>
SSI implies control, cant have control without privacy
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:28:39 GMT):<br/>
key part of what makes indy special
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:29:29 GMT):<br/>
breakout on SSI later in the afternoon, 15 people from various devs and contributors
grt questions, grt opportunity to discuss indy priv features in more detail, good questions on how it works, how DIDs work, why Indy does things the way it does
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:33:37 GMT):<br/>
Privacy and control connection
Technology AND regulation issues

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:34:03 GMT):<br/>
problem of priv is not when voluntarily consented, but when tech doesnt give you proper tools to manage what you do and dont reveal
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:35:09 GMT):<br/>
ROUVEN: priv can be solved on social and legal level, even tech side, needs to be built into the ledger, others think not
can do parts off-chain completely
can put things into one layer and solve in a different one
can solve priv by sharing and selectively disclose in other ways

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:35:24 GMT):<br/>
NATHAN - agree, data not on the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:36:56 GMT):<br/>
@Rouven we would love to talk about these techniques.  Bring all good ideas and approaches!
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:37:12 GMT):<br/>
easy for parties to collude to triangulate data
pairwise ID limit context that you bound the attributes to, from crypto protocol perspective, you can limit
PHIL - agree - lot of layers and approaches to each

ROUVEN - there are good solutions in Indy, but there might be diff solutions addressing same problem
one of the reqs
can solve with pairwise
good reasons why usefule
some reasons TO correlate things

</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:37:21 GMT):<br/>
and yes, there are legal trust framework tools that are critical
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:38:02 GMT):<br/>
flip side - everything with pairwise, need to maintain good accounting system of who has seen what, revealed what - complexity
if someone needs to manage complexity it could be a user or third party - who is managing
not one answer, why do we try to force this is the solution
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:38:27 GMT):<br/>
always a trade-off, no absolutes
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:38:33 GMT):<br/>
@Rouven++ these discussions are a major purpose for these calls, thanks for the discussion
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:38:48 GMT):<br/>
PHIL - Indy is a grand experiment to seeing how well that complexity can be managed
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:40:56 GMT):<br/>
JohnBC - arent we able to be issuers of our own consent, if someone has my data illegal or otherwise w/o consetn, without my consent receipt for the use of that data - they are wrong
Rouven - especially in the EU
JohnBC - may have it, sold it
Rouven - like certain data gained via illegal means
also downsides for this approach
what is your attack vector? what optimizing for?
Every one has potential to correlate
move problem somewhere else

NATHAN - complexity trade-off - agree

<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:43:40 GMT):<br/>
Fuzzing and American Fuzzy Lop
Proposal - Fuzzing in detail for Lisbon
findings and code for fuzzing the Indy Crypto library
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:44:04 GMT):<br/>
Lib written in Rust

<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:45:25 GMT):<br/>
American Fuzzy Lop homepage - 
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:45:56 GMT):<br/>
uses learning algo and code coverage to compromise 
sends "buncha junk", measures how code responded, mutates junk to measure how the code reacts
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:47:59 GMT):<br/>
coming up with instrumentation and code to run fuzzing against
Big enough to matter but small enough to complete
teach at hackfest, aall of the code in HL and building corpusces to test that software
hardest part of fuzzing, get an initial set of garbage data and write the code that wraps the lib you are fuzzing
havent gotten to point to run fuzzer against the lib
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:48:36 GMT):<br/>
fuzzing meant to fill gap
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:49:03 GMT):<br/>
NATHAN - build pipeline or code repos?
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:49:58 GMT):<br/>
DaveH - popular, give it a random set of data, let it go runnign diff combinations, will find bugs, it optimizes corpus down to an executable set of code, make into unit tests
output is not a bunch of bugs, but repeatable tests
when it does find a bug and fix
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:50:30 GMT):<br/>
using AFL - capability to test C, C++, Py, Javascript
2018 - year to fuzz all our code and translate into repeatable tests
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:50:54 GMT):<br/>
AFL is a thing DaveH has come to as the last thing to do before you say "we are confident in the software)
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:52:30 GMT):<br/>

AFL deployed against REST APIs
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:53:44 GMT):<br/>
Get calls with garbage data and hung process - didnt crash but would be a DDoS vector, get server process to hang, resources exhausted, found wihtin a day
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 16:54:29 GMT):<br/>
handled in confidential security handling system
Presented at Lisbon hackfest
not a zero-day, but deemed to be a mediaum to low risk

<p><strong>turmewr3ck</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 11:27:13 GMT):<br/>
Is the forthcoming new agent2agent API (including listeners, connections, etc) currently best documented in wrappers/dotnet/indy-sdk-dotnet/AgentApi (branch feature/agent2agent_api_v2), or are there other (public) documents worth considering at this point?
</p>
<p><strong>srottem</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 23:17:32 GMT):<br/>
That documentation is also available in web-consumable form here for the moment: https://srottem.github.io/indy-sdk/wrappers/dotnet/docs/api/Hyperledger.Indy.AgentApi.html
</p>
<p><strong>srottem</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 23:18:07 GMT):<br/>
We're working on getting it hosted on the official hyperledger github at the moment.
</p>
<p><strong>turmewr3ck</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 09:14:43 GMT):<br/>
Interesting thanks. That documentation does not reflect what is on the "feature/agent2agent_api_v2" branch. Does the AgentApi on that branch in the official indy-sdk repository reflect the forthcoming Agent API, or will it be something else?
</p>
<p><strong>srottem</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 10:54:07 GMT):<br/>
Interesting.  The Java wrapper on the feature/agent2agent_api_v2 branch is up to date but for some reason the the .NET wrapper changes haven't been pulled it.  The documentation link I gave you accurately represents what's on master at the moment, which includes the new agent2agent API.  @gudkov - should I re-open the PR for the .NET changes to get them pulled into that branch?

On Mac OS, you need to modify the `client_for_pool_start.sh` script to use the `-E` option instead of the `-r` option on the `sed` command:
```if [ -z "$IP" ]; then
	IP_REGEXP="([0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+\\.)([0-9]+)"
	BASE_IP=$(echo "$LAST_NODE_IP" | sed -E "s/${IP_REGEXP}/\1/")
	LAST_GROUP=$(echo "$LAST_NODE_IP" | sed -E "s/${IP_REGEXP}/\2/")
	((LAST_GROUP++))
	IP="${BASE_IP}${LAST_GROUP}"
fi
```

I would like to run a local standalone indy-node in order to test a client/agent using the indy-sdk. Is that a good approach, or should I be testing against another running test ledger instance? If it's recommended to run a locally running ledger instance (probably with four nodes that are running locally), how would I set this up? Thanks in advance!
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 14:54:39 GMT):<br/>
HI @mhailstone . A local pool is a good way to do test & development.  If you have the RAM to support it, there are instructions and scripts to set up a 4 node pool locally using vagrant and virtualbox.  This is what I use.  Others use docker scripts that have been contributed by the community.  https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-environments/blob/stable/vagrant/training/vb-multi-vm/TestIndyClusterSetup.md
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 16:47:39 GMT):<br/>
@mgbailey Thank you for the response. Could you point me to the docker scripts as well?
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 16:49:46 GMT):<br/>
@mhailstone , @WadeBarnes just posted this in another channel: 
 You may also want to have a look at the work we've done here; https://github.com/bcgov/von-network
It's a 4 node pool and it adds a basic ledger explorer and a few other features.
Runs on Docker/Docker Compose
You can find a running instance here; http://138.197.170.136

I'm attempting to run the java samples in the `./hyperledger/indy-sdk/samples/java/src/main/java/Main.java` file. The `Agent.demo` works, but I'm failing in the `Anoncreds.demo` call with the error:
```ERROR|indy::errors::indy            |                 src/errors/indy.rs:63  | Casting error to ErrorCode: Pool ledger config already exists Pool ledger config file with name "default_pool" already exists

How can I delete the `default_pool`?

</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 17:35:56 GMT):<br/>
@mhailstone It is in ~/indy_sdk/sandbox/pools, or something similar.  I don't have a vm running right now to make sure this path is exactly right.  

</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 17:37:05 GMT):<br/>
Another approach would be to just do a try {} catch{} around that call.  Do nothing if this error occurs, and execution will proceed normally.
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 17:37:12 GMT):<br/>
This is what I do
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 17:38:02 GMT):<br/>
@mgbailey I don't see a sandbox/pools directory, but I will implement the try/catch.
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 17:41:38 GMT):<br/>
I implemented the try/catch, but now when the `Pool.openPoolLedger` call is invoked I get the following error:
```ERROR|indy::errors::indy            |                 src/errors/indy.rs:63  | Casting error to ErrorCode: Pool work terminated

<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 17:45:39 GMT):<br/>
I am working in python rather than java, but things should track pretty closely.  I assume your error is in the "create_wallet" call?
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 17:46:02 GMT):<br/>
excuese me, no
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 17:46:25 GMT):<br/>
In the create_pool_ledger_config call?
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 17:48:24 GMT):<br/>
If so, this is how I handle it: 
'''
   try:
      await pool.create_pool_ledger_config(pool_name, pool_config)
   except IndyError as err:
      if (err.error_code == 306):
         logger.warning("Pool %s already exists. Skipping create.", pool_name)
      else:
         raise
'''
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 17:53:37 GMT):<br/>
I put a try/catch around the `Pool.createPoolLedgerConfig(DEFAULT_POOL_NAME, createPoolLedgerConfigJSONParameter.toJson()).get();` in PoolUtils.java:48, but now the exception happens in Anoncreds.java:22 `Pool pool = Pool.openPoolLedger(poolName, "{}").get();`
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 17:56:05 GMT):<br/>
Strange. If the pool already exists, it should just be able to use the existing pool...  I'll spin up a VM and find that path for you.
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 18:15:51 GMT):<br/>
@mhailstone try deleting the directory ~/.indy_client/pool/default_pool
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 19:07:12 GMT):<br/>
I stopped the von-network, deleted both the `pool` and `wallet` directories in the `~/.indy_client` directory restarted the von-network (./manage start) and I still get the above error when running the samples.

Hey I'm looking for details about how the faber.py agent is initialised. Basically I'm trying to create my own one - but my understanding is that I need to tell it where to look for the network? 
My initialisation log looks like this:

You see that line - 'llistening for other nodes at 0.0.0.0:6001' I believe this is the line that I want to point else where? 
</p>
<p><strong>dwjohnston</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 03:15:29 GMT):<br/>
Ok, I see it's in agent.py - an agent creates a client? 
</p>
<p><strong>dwjohnston</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 03:20:13 GMT):<br/>
Arrh, what is a client. 
</p>
<p><strong>dwjohnston</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 04:11:52 GMT):<br/>
Ok,  I might have worked this out. 
</p>
<p><strong>dwjohnston</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 04:12:14 GMT):<br/>
I think the pool_transactions_genesis tells you the IP addresses of the nodes
</p>
<p><strong>dwjohnston</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 04:15:06 GMT):<br/>
I can post something when I've got this worked out. I can possibly submit a PR for the docker demo? 
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 15:01:53 GMT):<br/>
@dwjohnston You are on the right track with the genesis file.  Note that doing this is a good academic exercise, but is of limited long-term practical use since the agent made will be incompatible with the newer indy-sdk. Here is a document that will also help. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kQcdICAYmSqbk4d5lUtFhk2L55dKJMfyM0JbZPeG55s/edit?usp=sharing
</p>
<p><strong>wittrock</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 15:05:59 GMT):<br/>
@mgbailey how is the agent going to be made incompatible? is the protocol changing or just how we integrate it into larger applications?
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 15:06:49 GMT):<br/>
The inter-agent communications protocol will be different.
</p>
<p><strong>wittrock</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 15:07:35 GMT):<br/>
aha. is there a summary of the change somewhere?
</p>
<p><strong>wittrock</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 15:07:49 GMT):<br/>
or even what the current protocol is?
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 15:10:16 GMT):<br/>
Unfortunately, it is still evolving.  I don't have good information on it at this time.  I'll see if I can get one of the architects to chime in.
</p>
<p><strong>wittrock</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 15:10:29 GMT):<br/>
that would be great, thank you!

<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 15:31:29 GMT):<br/>
@dwjohnston @wittrock All agents (faber, acme, etc.) from indy-node repos will be deprecated soon. Existing Getting Started is also going to be replaced by a new one.
Please follow https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk for up-to-date approaches regarding any client and agent communication. 
Old agents (faber, acme from indy-node) assumed to use ZMQ.
new agent-to-agent communicaiton is transport-agnostic. It can be done via pure http. Indy-sdk provides necessary crypto calls to make it secure (such as `authcrypt`, `anoncrypt`)
</p>
<p><strong>wittrock</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 15:34:39 GMT):<br/>
@ashcherbakov thanks for answering! Do you have a timeline for their deprecation and timeline to non-functionality? I'm putting together a demo of agents but there isn't a good resource yet for creating an agent with the SDK. I'm thinking of using the indy-client agents to get a simple initial version working, which might be fine if they'll still work for three months, but won't be fine if they will only work for two weeks
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 15:35:58 GMT):<br/>
I suspect we may deprecate them sooner than 3 months, but not sure. Probably @Sean_Bohan has better answer.

Hi, I allways thought that claims are stored in the wallets. But when I run the Docker setup and inspect the wallet, there are no claims in there (when doing the "getting started" "Faber" example). So where are claims stored?

<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 12:51:33 GMT):<br/>
@wolili you may use old client implementation (in the current getting started). I belive it may have multiple wallets (one for claims, one for keys) located at ~/.indy-cli/wallets
BTW real clients (and hence wallets and claims implementation) should be based on indy-sdk.
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 12:51:49 GMT):<br/>
A new getting started will come soon which is based on indy-sdk

<p><strong>mawi</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 17:49:18 GMT):<br/>
Hello everyone. Quick question: should a consent receipt be stored and handled as a verifiable claim, or an attribute to both NYMs?
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 17:50:42 GMT):<br/>
I would vote for Verifiable claim which is off ledger
</p>
<p><strong>mawi</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 18:09:16 GMT):<br/>
My thought as well. Should a data subject (who provided consent) then manually inform a data controller (who acquired consent) when he revokes consent? In this example, the data subject can't manipulate the revocation registry, right?
</p>
<p><strong>mawi</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 18:11:28 GMT):<br/>
Maybe he could then inform the organization which created the claim_def on which consent was given that he wants to revoke consent. Then when the creator of the claim_def adds a revocation to the associated revoc_reg it could be seen as a confirmation of the revocation? I hope my question/thought process is clear...
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 18:51:57 GMT):<br/>
would be easier for me to understand this in terms of Verifiable Claims language rather than (i think) GDPR ...

So your question perhaps is:

A holder of a verifiable claim (issued to them by an issuer) is offering a claim as a proof to a verifier. Once this proof is proven by the verifier, the verifier and perhaps the holder, would store a consent receipt of that proof. Presumably some PII data of some sort has been given to the verifier in the course of this interaction. At some later point in time the holder wishes to remove their consent for the verifier to have their PII data.


</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 18:51:57 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 18:56:44 GMT):<br/>
I think you are also suggesting there is a claim definition on the ledger based on a consent receipt schema. As far as I know only issuers create claim definitions for claims they wish to issue. This is when the revocation register is created and is controlled by this issuer. So now the question is who is the issuer of the consent receipt.
</p>
<p><strong>mawi</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 18:59:20 GMT):<br/>
Yes, my bad. The scenario as you sketch it is what I meant as well. The last question is indeed the interesting part
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:00:25 GMT):<br/>
I want to say that the holder of the PII could become an issuer of consent receipts to a verifier that request PII data however I feel like that could end up leaking information about the holder
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:01:41 GMT):<br/>
If the holder was also the issuer of the concent reciept then perhaps they could then revoke consent and the verifier would no longer be able to prove they have consent to use the PII they are storing on behalf of the holder
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:01:41 GMT):<br/>
If the holder was also the issuer of the consent receipt (now a verifiable claim to the verifier) then perhaps they could then revoke consent and the verifier would no longer be able to prove they have consent to use the PII they are storing on behalf of the holder
</p>
<p><strong>mawi</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:02:06 GMT):<br/>
Exactly
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:02:55 GMT):<br/>
I like that conceptually .. I just don't know right now what this would mean in terms of public data on ledger connected to a person
</p>
<p><strong>mawi</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:02:58 GMT):<br/>
So for that to work the holder should maintain a claim definition and revocation registry, right?
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:03:20 GMT):<br/>
Yes that is my understanding of the current model
</p>
<p><strong>mawi</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:03:26 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I would have to research that 
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:04:28 GMT):<br/>
so the holder would have a DID, DID Doc, Claim Def based on a consent reciept schema (perhaps published by the verifier, or maybe there emerges a standard schema), and a revocation registry
</p>
<p><strong>mawi</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:04:38 GMT):<br/>
maybe if the claim definition for consent receipts would only contain the DID of the holder and the verifier + a hash of the (encrypted) consent receipt. That wouldn't reveal anything public i dont think
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:05:27 GMT):<br/>
the consent receipt issued by the holder in this scenario would still be off ledger 
</p>
<p><strong>mawi</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:05:44 GMT):<br/>
Exactly
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:06:30 GMT):<br/>
claim def is just the schema + magic crypto materials so that is "safe" except that everyone knows DID XYZ may have issued some consent receipts to unknown other DID(s)
</p>
<p><strong>mawi</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:07:12 GMT):<br/>
Yes, so the only thing public is that certain DIDs have shared some data with other DIDs 
</p>
<p><strong>mawi</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:07:19 GMT):<br/>
To my understanding at least
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:07:23 GMT):<br/>
if the schema is very widely used .. that seems not so terrible
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:08:01 GMT):<br/>
I don't think that there would be any public record of data having been shared nor between which DIDs
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:08:35 GMT):<br/>
In fact, if the relationship is pairwise .. those DIDs are not going to be on ledger 
</p>
<p><strong>mawi</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:08:41 GMT):<br/>
Oh no wait of course
</p>
<p><strong>mawi</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:08:53 GMT):<br/>
I had it mixed up with the claim definition
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:09:05 GMT):<br/>
they will only be stored in the pairwise relationships respective wallets
</p>
<p><strong>mawi</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:09:08 GMT):<br/>
The actual receipt is off-ledger ofc. 
</p>
<p><strong>mawi</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:09:18 GMT):<br/>
Yeah
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:09:41 GMT):<br/>
So .. could be quite safe and very cool
</p>
<p><strong>mawi</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:09:52 GMT):<br/>
:)
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:09:54 GMT):<br/>
but we need the guru's to weigh in I think
</p>
<p><strong>mawi</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:10:00 GMT):<br/>
Yeah I agree

@mawi, @jljordan_bcgov - listening in on your convo.   I'm not convinced that VCs are the way to go here (although they could work) - and they are the only thing we have, right now. Perhaps something different is needed.

My concerns are the heavyweight feel of the use of VCs for this (we need something lighter), and that a revocation is a unilateral act that means nothing until there is a verification of the VC. So if I revoke my Consent Receipt (CR) VC, the Holder (e.g. BigCorp) doesn't know it until I tell it.  Since I have to do that anyway, why not just use signed messages to implement the entire CR process?  For example:

* Before/After proving a CR, I send a message that says "I, DID 1234, agree to share PII with DID 9876 at time 9:00:00GMT" and I sign it with my private key.  BigCorp (DID 9876) adds "I, DID 9876, agree" and signs it with their private key.  I might also put a limit on how long I'm willing to share the data. We both retain a copy.

* I prove the claim.

* Later, I decide to revoke the CR. I send the message back to DID 9876 with a new addition - "I, DID 1234 revoke my consent" and again sign the message.  BigCorp acknowledges and sends a signed note back.

* Potential problem here - I have no proof that I actually sent the message to BigCorp, so they have some deniability.  However, since the outcome of a failed CR process is likely legal and offline, it might be sufficient to have a way to show I tried to send the message at a certain time. #morethoughtneeded

For this to work at scale, I think we need a pairwise protocol for CRs with structured data for the data elements - the DIDs, timestamps, consent/revocation and signatures.   As I say, VCs might be the answer, but to me they seem too heavy.

<p><strong>mawi</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 08:29:19 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran My initial feeling was the same, it seems a little weird to 'claim' consent. But as you've stated, at the moment there is no other way to record it on the ledger. My issue is that I think that not in every scenario where consent is provided, a claim must be proved. For example, if I agree that a fitness tracker may track my location, I don't share a VC about this event, right?

I feel a lightweight way of doing this might be to create a minimal Consent Receipt schema, which might look something like this:
consent_receipt_schema = {
    'name': 'Consent Receipt',
    'version': '0.1',
    'attr_names': ['consent_receiver', 'data', 'consent_duration']
}

Here, the issuer of consent specifies who receives consent (would just be a DID), the data (a hash of the consent receipt file), and maybe the duration of consent (e.g. 1 month). 

Now, everyone who gives consent can reference this standard schema, whereby the actual consent details are in the consent receipt data. If I'm not mistaken, revocation should be rather simple now, by using the revocation registry. Can a holder 'listen' to the ledger, so that they may be alerted when a claim they hold has been revoked?

I'm not sure if my line of thinking here is according to Indy's vision. I'm very curious about your feedback.

<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 17:30:59 GMT):<br/>
so @mawi and @swcurran 
in @mawi example above .. would still be a issue consent receipt as a claim as this is the only way to have a revocation registry that is on the ledger

I think this is not just a tech solution .. but a convention that over time verifiers will request consent receipts from holders, if they use data post revocation of the consent receipt well in EU they are breaking the law .. elsewhere perhaps they are liable
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 18:09:14 GMT):<br/>
@mawi - there is no "listener" capability right now, so only polling or a notification from the revoking party.  So what is available today is still insufficient.  Hence my suggesting the approach be covered by other than a Verifiable Credential.

Not sure of Indy's vision on this. They have examples in documents of CRs, but there is no code to specifically support it.

@jljordan_bcgov - agree this is a convention that will evolve over time. However, that convention could be facilitated by some tech to make it easier to achieve the convention - e.g. make CRs a first class entity like a verifiable credential.  Which comes first - convention or standard?  :-)

@swcurran @jljordan_bcgov I agree. I do feel a standard could be developed before a convention though. As you also stated, CR functionality is clearly mentioned in multiple Sovrin documents, but there is no code for it. @Team Sovrin, is CR functionality on the roadmap/agenda?

@danielhardman Hey Daniel, I just watched the recording of the meeting yesterday. You refer to a post/analysis Steven made on the scaling characteristics and how expensive a lookup currently is.
Do you (or someone else) has this post on hand and can share it with me? Thanks! 
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 14:19:38 GMT):<br/>
Hi @Skorpion7777 @danielhardman  there isn't a post, but I can share some data.  I ran a test with a modified version of the Alice/Faber getting started script, to add a loop and grant Alice multiple transcripts.  I found that the time required for the get_claims_for_proof_req() call increased linearly with the number of transcripts (as did the resulting message size).  With 200 transcripts the response time was ~200 msec (non-encrypted database).  With our solution we're storing millions of claims so obviously linear performance is a concern.
</p>
<p><strong>Skorpion7777</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 14:26:30 GMT):<br/>
@ianco If you can share that data that would be great! Thanks!
I need to think a bit more about Daniels proposal excluding claims from the ledger. Seems very ruff, but maybe with a good alternative storing solution it is better
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 14:29:24 GMT):<br/>
@Skorpion7777 there are 2 csv files here:  https://github.com/ianco/indy-sdk/tree/master/samples/python.  default.csv is a run with 100 transcripts with the response time for each get_claims_for_proof_req() call.   enterprise.csv is a run with a poc virtual wallet.
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 14:29:58 GMT):<br/>
each run adds a transcript so it shows the performance characteristic as the number of claims grows
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 14:30:20 GMT):<br/>
It's a small number of claims and not a realistic scenario but it shows the trends
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 17:54:16 GMT):<br/>
@Skorpion7777 - credentials (claims) are not stored on the ledger as they (may) contain private information which is generally a bad thing to put on a public ledger. Credentials are held in the wallets of the identities that hold them (to whom they have been issued).  @danielhardman was talking about redefining the term "wallet" to separate it into two parts from an API perspective - a part to hold the crypto elements (private keys, link secret, etc.) and the credentials.
</p>
<p><strong>Skorpion7777</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 21:30:45 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran Ahh, thanks for clarifying Stephen. Some time has passed since I've read the what goes on the ledger paper. probably will give it a re-read this weekend.
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Sun, 25 Feb 2018 02:07:47 GMT):<br/>
@Skorpion7777 you may want to look at a small project https://kumu.io/maher-bouidani/bc-govern#bc-govern/worksafe-bc we did which visualizes our "BCovrin" development ledger .. we also did a simple dashboard ... http://138.197.170.136 
We had many many discussions about "What's on the ledger" and this really helped us make it straightforward ... 
Now these are simple efforts and not meant for anything other than basic helpers right now

<p><strong>vinomaster</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 14:54:21 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman @swcurran Gents just trying to catch upon the Wallet design discussions. If storage of SSI metadata and claims will be separate where will the correlation between DID and Claims (per connection) be maintained?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 17:42:22 GMT):<br/>
@vinomaster @danielhardman Thinking the same thing from another angle. We noticed in the code that the "store_claim_in_wallet" call does not return a handle to the claim.  In order to (at least) revoke a claim, would an Agent not need to store the claim in the Enterprise "CRM" (or whatever) associated with the claim subject? 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 17:44:56 GMT):<br/>
That would also help us for our problem of filtering on claims.  If we could include in the proof request a list of credential IDs, then we would have a mechanism for the filtering needed for our TOB use case.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 19:41:49 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman - thinking if the wallet credential IDs are known to the issuer, we could extend the proof request section of JSON that current allows list-of-schema, list-of-issuer to also support a list-of-credentialIDs.  It's out of band for how the Verifier gets the list of credentialIDs and up to the Holder to provide that - if they want/it is appropriate.

Changes needed: Return credentialID when stored in wallet; extend Proof Request structure.

Would that work?

<p><strong>vinomaster</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 14:30:12 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman @nage We are trying gather an understanding of the protocol wire-formatted structure for a proof-response. We are tediously walking code (i.e.: agent.prover()) and modifying source to dump message structures being built in the indy-anoncreds source (primary_proof_builder.py). Is there someone we can talk to who can describe the data structure (sub-structures) for a proof-response? In particular, we are interested in the difference between what is being sent back between a self-attested attribute and a verifiable-attribute. I would imagine that for testcases to be written - someone had to write down these structures -- shamelessly hoping this source is not the only documentation of the wire-formats.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 14:41:01 GMT):<br/>
@vinomaster The best source of documentation is probably going to be @devin-fisher or @wightman or @KhageshSharma , since they have been actively involved in building a product that exchanges proof requests in the past 3 months. I don't know exactly what they have written, but they will know what's available. I do know that @jlaw 1 is busy writing docs on this very subject as well.

@swcurran @ianco I have been thinking really, really hard about how to fully address your TOB use case such that credentials become richly searchable but the wallet's simplicity, high bar for security, and pluggability are retained. What I've begun to like is a tagging mechanism where you could insert credentials with as much metadata as you like (issuer, schema, subject, etc--but also values of as many internal attributes as you care to make searchabe), and the wallet would allow efficient queries. See this slide deck: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1X6F9QVG8M4PqQQLLL_5I6aQ5z7CCpYyYHBNKYMlsqXc/edit?ts=5a9476ba
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 14:46:31 GMT):<br/>
I believe this would allow you to write a wallet impl for TOB that's backed by a searchable doc store like mongo, or by an industrial RDBMS, and it would still have exactly the same interface as the tiny one implemented with sqllite (sqlcypher) in indy-sdk.

@danielhardman thanks will give your doc a read.  FYI imho if we are going to make the wallet "searchable" then the best implementation choice is a document-oriented DB like MondoDB or CouchDB (whereas if the wallet is just a simple key/value store then a SQL database is probably best).  For TOB the current thought is to keep the wallet key/value storage and "searchable" content separate.  But in either case one of the important questions is how to tie this into a proof request.  (The main driver is the fact that anoncreds will fetch all claims from the wallet in get_claims_for_proof_req()" and we want to be able to filter this.

I guess I am assuming that anoncreds will stop fetching all credentials from the wallet, if we make the wallet searchable. Rather, it will fetch just those credentials that satisfy a few criteria.

@danielhardman Fun stuff!  I like what you have in the presentation.  I have some comments on different slides that I'd be interested in your response - perhaps turn on commenting on the presentation in Google?

Our immediate concern is how the information necessary to use the tags flows within libindy from anoncreds to a wallet implementation.  I'm assuming by your comment above that (b) is a given - filter data *must* be able to be passed from the wallet caller into the wallet.  It would be great to get agreement on a design for how that interface will change. The current implementation will not work at scale.

Regarding tags. I like that it means that the item itself can remain opaque, and it's up to the wallet owner (agent) to add tags necessary to retrieve items as needed for their implementation. However, for credentials arbitrary tags independent of the schema eliminates the use of a common language between the verifier and prover to negotiate the desired credential to be used for a Proof.  If we did use the a claim name/value pair, both parties would understand the filtering.



I think (a) is going to be a common use case - a prover could be holding several of a specific type of credential and the verifier wants to influence the one returned in an A2A scenario.  Do you think that will be done via out-of-band negotiation, or should that go into the Proof Request - the only current in-band place currently available.

@swcurran: From our work on Mobile identity our experience is that to remain truly self-sovereign the Verifier has a right to describe what they require in a proof request and in some cases based on the role/relationship of the Verifier with an Issuer (i.e.: Cop with DMV; Clerk with Pharmacy) the Verifier may not has a choice and the Issuer defines proof request requirements for various roles. Furthermore, the Owner/Holder must be allowed to respond as they deem comfortable in a proof-response. This means they may respond without meeting the criteria. How such incomplete or unsatisfied exchanges are handles is a policy decision at the verifier and out of scope for the tech IMHO. We do not want to insert ourselves into the job of the Verifier, we only seek to help simplify the experience. The Verifier is ultimately accountable/liable.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 02 Mar 2018 16:30:02 GMT):<br/>
Agreed for the most part - particularly  in the mobile context. The challenge I'm seeing is when the interaction is agent-to-agent (system-to-system) and their is no human in the middle to understand the request and respond appropriately to satisfy the intent of the request.  As soon as there is ambiguity, there needs to be some negotiation/rules to resolve the ambiguity, and I think that has to involve both the Verifier and the Prover.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=fqaM6tqFPvPACmCiM) @vinomaster Queries have a scope of one wallet only. Higher-level queries spanning a full domain are conceivable but would not be the job of the wallet interface.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=f7Qjeo2dcAKHoMKYc) @vinomaster This has only been whiteboarded at this point, but here's the thinking: two parties agree in advance that they will coordinate via a beacon on the public ledger, if they become disconnected. This beacon needs to have some identifier that both parties know but that is not correlating for either of them. When you write to a beacon, you basically submit a transaction to the ledger that says, "I want to activate a beacon with the following identifier. Here is a state proof that shows what I think about the state of the relationship." The other party eventually sees the beacon and compares its own knowledge of the relationship state to decide whether it will accept the remote party's view of where they should resume communications.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=LKwcw75725ESzms3P) @swcurran Verifiers express criteria in the proof request (in-band). The Prover must convert the criteria in the proof request into tags in their wallet. Imagine that the Prover says, "I need a proof from a credential that matches schema X or Y, where the issuer is Z, and the issue date is within the past month, and the subject of the credential is 'Acme Corp'". There are ways to say this in proof requests; if you haven't seen docs on that topic, let me know and I'll track them down and post them here for you.

So the prover gets this request and says, "Okay, I need to map these criteria into tags in my wallet." And comes up with something like this (here, I'm using SQL and imagining an RDBMS backing store for the wallet, but there could be an analog for MongoDB or similar tech as well):

SELECT i.item_id, i.value
FROM item i
  INNER JOIN text_tags t1 ON i.item_id=t1.item_id
  INNER JOIN int_tags t2 ON i.item_id = t2.item_id
  INNER JOIN text_tags t3 on i.item_id = t3.item_id
WHERE i.item_name like ‘cred:*’
  AND t1.tname=’subject’ AND t1.tval like ‘Acme%’
  AND t2.tname=’issue_date’ AND t2.tval > date_to_int(last week)
  AND t3.tname='schema_name' and t3.tval in (schema1, schema2)

<p><strong>vinomaster</strong> (Sat, 03 Mar 2018 18:51:28 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman: Related to this topic of identifying claims applicable to a proof-request, I have been conversing with @devin-fisher and after walking code in anocreds and mapping the code to the zkp math (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-anoncreds/blob/master/docs/dev/anoncred.pdf) the following seems to me to still be unclear --  When a proof request contains a series of verifiable attributes, it is assumed (maybe incorrectly) that the proof response will carry some extra crypto or metadata in the response payload for those tagged verifiable attributes so that the inspector can gain trust in the origin of the verifiable attributes. It is assumed that what is passed back to the Inspector for a self-attested attribute should be different for what is passed back for verifiable attributes. As such an understanding of the proof-response payload is of interest.
</p>
<p><strong>vinomaster</strong> (Sat, 03 Mar 2018 18:56:10 GMT):<br/>
My concern here is that I believe the zkp math is applicable under some business situation but not all. Under the notion of a Web of Trust based trust chain I can see where the zkp math applies. However, when an Inspector (Verifiers) needs to address certain business policies for verification a zkp may not be adequate. I refer to the notion of a "Policy Driven Trust" whereby the Verifier is assumed to have no knowledge, relationship or chain of trust with Issuers associated with the verifiable attributes presented in a proof-response. 
</p>
<p><strong>vinomaster</strong> (Sat, 03 Mar 2018 19:15:51 GMT):<br/>
In the physical world what I refer to here is the concept of a vetting process. What ins intriguing for us in the SSI community is that we have an opportunity to address digital vetting processes. Assume the Inspector has to have verifiable evidence that he/she can verify for each verifiable attribute that the origin of that attribute value came from the issuer the prover claims he/she claims to have received it from. So if we can agree that there may exist cases where the Verifier lacks a trust chain for Issuers associated with each of the  prover presented verifiable-attributes AND Verifier policy dictates that there must be recordable evidence in the Verifiable SOR that each verifiable attributes was issued a valid Issuer THEN we may need to have the option of processing proof-requests/responses in more than only one possible manner. Finally, on the requirement of correlation at the Inspector level -- there are well documented cases where a Verifier for policy reasons may require not just  proof of certain attributes but proof from specific types of Issuers (i.e.: Government). So again, sometimes the assumptions for the zkp arcocreds may not always hold. I am sure I have overlooked something and will try to write this up to improve the quality of the conversation. My question is who should the conversation be with? Do I just submit it as a JITA story to be debated?  BTW - just got power/water back after a long sleepless nite after Nor'Easter Riley so I am sure my articulation herein needs help. :-(
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 04 Mar 2018 19:45:55 GMT):<br/>
@vinomaster - I've written an article about the vetting process for a Verifier.  This (I think) answers some of your questions about what HL-Indy provides in a Proof.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nYq0iakgtyC21oUGWa5hLuJUoKeJFpURtGz6HcLIltY/edit?usp=sharing

In general - your questions/concerns are covered in the HL-Indy implementation - the verifier knows the issuer, the verifier can (in the Proof Request) require the issuer be a specific entity (by requiring a specific Issuer DID), or use a specific schema - or both.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=WiBFT4ovovPZBSGL9) @vinomaster We been talking with folks at IBM Research in Zurich (the creators of idemix and ABC4Trust) about a concept called ZKLang. This deals with expressing proof requirements to a crypto engine in a formal mathematical way, and can safely be ignored by most consumers of Indy. But it intersects with your observation about the response payload, because we've identified the need for something between a proof request and the mathematical computation that satisfies it, and we're calling this intermediate thing a "Proof Resolution". You can think of it like a query execution plan in an RDBMS; it shows how the criteria in a proof request are being mapped into a set of credentials and attributes. One of the possible uses of a Proof Resolution is as part of the payload of a proof presentation, allowing a verifier to know more about how the proving is being approached. I think this may help with the vetting you're thinking about.

In the Proof handling process (Offer, Request, Proof), is there any mechanism within the protocol to convey multiple proofs in response to a proof request?  Multiple proofs could be sent be the Prover, but since the process is async, the Verifier would not know when it had received all of the responses.  Example might be references for a job application, family members on an insurance application, etc.

Suggestions on how that might be handled?

<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 15:36:44 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @pimotte! Should we decide on a particular method and/or mime-type so the community is in conformity in how to exchange the data between agents?
</p>
<p><strong>pimotte</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 15:41:49 GMT):<br/>
I think that's something that will be up to implementations of agents that need to interact. But if you're looking for a recommendation, application/octet-stream seems like a good fit
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 15:45:56 GMT):<br/>
application/octet-stream sounds great to me as well. I am concerned about interoperability with any agent no matter what the implementation. We are defining an Open API 2.0 document that defines an Agent API that we hope to share soon. With an API definition, this would help interoperability from any Indy Agent to other Agents. We'll incorporate application/octet-stream for now unless others have other recommendations. Thanks for your input @pimotte.

<p><strong>nage</strong> (Mon, 26 Mar 2018 16:59:02 GMT):<br/>
It should.  As versions of the library roll out and compatible servers become more common, the hurdles for adoption and library availability should disappear.

Question about pairwise DIDs.. Does a new pairwise DID get generated for every interaction with two agents A and B? or is it the same DID for every pair A and B.  Another question: Do all DIDs get registered on the ledger and are public before the secure comm. channel is established?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Mon, 26 Mar 2018 20:36:19 GMT):<br/>
Pairwise IDs get reused whenever you want the unit of correlation to be reused
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Mon, 26 Mar 2018 20:38:01 GMT):<br/>
You can chose to register them before or after the interaction.  For some cases an agent might refuse to interact with an unregistered is because it needs guarantees provided by registration, but that will probably be a rare case.  Many of these ids could exist off-ledger provided the agents have a way to find each other again when agents move and keys are rotated (there are ways of doing that part on the ledger more cheaply and securely)
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Mon, 26 Mar 2018 20:39:33 GMT):<br/>
Registering identifiers well before an interaction or after an interaction also helps avoid timing correlation (look these two identifiers were created at almost the exact same time, I bet these two organizations connected!).

Does someone here have a clear view on the relationship between Sovrin's A2A protocols and the work by DIF on 'Hubs'? I'm not quite sure how the interaction between edge/cloud agents and hubs could/should look like.

<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 06:31:36 GMT):<br/>
@mawi Ironic you should ask that as that is one of the main topics of discussion here at Internet Identity Workshop #26 in Mountain View. Today was the first of three days and it was FILLED with discussion of your exact question. I've just returned to my AirBNB and have to crash to get enough sleep for tomorrow, but I'll summarize it this way: there are major discussions going on between the different groups working on the Sovrin A2A protocols, the uPort identity wallet protocols, and the DIF hub protocol discussions, and good progress is being made. Stayed tuned (one way is listening to the tweet stream on the #IIW tag).

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=FWBuMmebSNueWPedg) @mawi Sorry for the slow response; I've had this half written all week... 

The short answer is that your edge agents and cloud agent should cooperate to share knowledge of the connection. Each agent has its own keys, but no matter which device (agent) initiates the connection, keys from all agents should be authorized to represent you to a greater (edge) or lesser (cloud) degree. The list of keys that can represent you is stored in your DID Doc and thus known to your connection.

I have a major question, how can agents communicate ? for example in the demo, how can I make faber send a message to acme without going through the CLI ?

You use crypto.py to prepare a message to send to the endpoint of the message receiver

Hey everyone. Question regarding web-based agents. 
If I want to create a web application which uses indy functionality, how would I go about executing the libindy code client-side? The browser would then have to initiate the creation of a wallet and key materials locally on the machine on which the browser is accessed. Would the browser then execute indy commands locally on the machine via API calls or? For example in Evernym's VCX demo (https://vimeo.com/262596133), I'm not sure how the web app could work 'under the hood'.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 23:55:58 GMT):<br/>
@mawi Current web applications store the wallets for the users server-side, but that isn't necessary best practice. There is a Node wrapper that can be leveraged. Delegating browser usage to the user is also a challenge, because browser site storage isn't always reliably backed up. Perhaps you would need a browser plugin?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 23:56:22 GMT):<br/>
This topic is discussed occasionally, but I haven't seen any clear answers yet.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 23:56:57 GMT):<br/>
For ease of implementation, I'm leaning toward storing the wallet server side and giving users a way to download and upload wallets. But there are good arguments against that practice.
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 06:57:45 GMT):<br/>
@esplinr and @mawi The bottom line is that eventually you want the browser to act as an edge-agent, i.e., to have the wallet integrated. But realistically that's years away. So the only options are either browser plug-ins (awkward), web wallets (bad idea), or out-of-band communication to mobile wallets (current best practice).
</p>
<p><strong>mawi</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 07:07:15 GMT):<br/>
@esplinr & @drummondreed I want to prevent having to use a server to store user's wallets, as that highly conflicts with the SSI vision. I've thought about extensions, but as you've said, that doesn't seem very user-friendly. I'll keep it as a constraint to use mobile devices. Thanks for your replies

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 21:41:45 GMT):<br/>
@nage / @drummondreed or others - a question about a slightly different use case for key rotation/updating a DID Doc.

Suppose that I have a pairwise connection to a Gov't Service in my Personal Agent (PA), but I now want the connection to be with the company I own that has a brand spanking new "Enterprise Agent" (EA).  Could the Enterprise Agent include a feature to allow it's connections (e.g. my Personal Agent) to request it create and send a new DID Doc by creating a keypair and populating new the DID Doc with the new Public Key and the EA's endpoint(s).  Once I get that DID Doc, my PA could use key rotation functionality to replace the current DID Doc for the connection with the DID Doc from my Enterprise Agent, thereby transferring control of the connection from my PA to my Organization's EA?

We're seeing this as a possible way to bootstrap an EA for an organization, allowing it to receive and hold the Credentials for the Organization.

Is this a good pattern? Any pros and cons to it?  Does the Service have a need to know anything about this?  Any thoughts on this?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 12:45:01 GMT):<br/>
From a technical perspective this approach works, but you might want to use an introduction pattern instead so that the correlation between the PA DID and EA isn’t so obvious.  @TelegramSam thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 13:00:15 GMT):<br/>
In this case the DID would stay the same, but the keys and service endpoints would change. There isn't really a way to hide that history.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 13:03:09 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran Providing a 'relinquish' service on an Agent to facilitate control transfer isn't a terrible idea. DID Docs themselves have (or had...) a guardian feature that made that relationship (from a key perspective) obvious. Not sure if this is needed in all cases.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 15:21:31 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. Once the connections are off ledger, the correlation risk is less of a concern - particular in the places we are thinking.  What I like about it is that it is controlled by the Owner/Org independent of the Service.  The Service doesn't care.

Do you have a link or a quick summary of the introduction pattern?  I can sort of imagine it, but not certain.

hi folks, I'm stuck here. ```Note that before you can use python wrapper you must install c-callable SDK. See the section "How-to-install" in Indy SDK```

Try running it with Python3 instead of Python
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 05 May 2018 08:09:51 GMT):<br/>
Alternatively it may be an issue with your PATH and how your Python is being found. Try setting up a Python virtual environment and installing all dependencies in there. Then activate it and try running it again. This way your Python interpreter won't go looking for packages in other places because they're all in the virtualenv

Hi, are the concepts of agents and agencies (edge or cloud) used anywhere outside of Indy ecosystem? 
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sun, 06 May 2018 23:41:58 GMT):<br/>
DIF is working on a hub concept that is very similar to cloud agents. We've been working closely with them to get communication protocols aligned
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 00:22:27 GMT):<br/>
BTW, "DIF" is the Decentralized Identity Foundation, http://identity.foundation/ 
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 00:24:07 GMT):<br/>
As @kdenhartog suggests, the DIF concept of identity hubs is similar to cloud agents, but more data-centric. DIF does not currently have the concept of edge agents. The generalized view of both cloud and edge agents and their roles in decentralized key management is covered in the DKMS Design and Architecture document: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/dkms/DKMS%20Design%20and%20Architecture%20V3.md

@kdenhartog thanks - I was able to get that going.
i'm running this setup on openstack. currently, each node of my cluster is on its own VM and it appears the cluster is working fine.
now I'm trying to run through the indy-sdk how-tos. I found the file ~/indy-sdk/cli/docker_pool_transactions_genesis and saw that I need to modify some of this to connect to my pool, which it does now.

I think I need to modify it some more, but I'm not sure where to get various pieces of data.

new error output below

@drummondreed - any more details on how the Dead Drop mechanism would work for DKMS?  The link in the Design & Architecture document is a little short on SSI details :-)
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 23:38:11 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran I'm not the full crypto expert but the basic idea is that the two identity owners, after they exchange their pairwise pseudonymous DIDs, do something similar to a Diffie-Helman key exchange to agree on a key to use for a *future* dead drop DID if they ever get disconnected. Then, if it ever happens, one of them registers the dead drop DID on the agreed upon ledger, and it contains the service endpoint at which they will "rendezvous" to do another real Diffie-Helman exchange to re-establish their private channel. Then they will share their updated pairwise pseudonymous DID documents and be back in sync.
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 23:38:19 GMT):<br/>
That all make sense?

@samadsajanlal any luck with getting the nodes communicating with each other?

<p><strong>samadsajanlal</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 16:22:06 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog negative, i'm still looking into it. doesn't help that i'm fairly new to the sovrin/indy codebase :)
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 16:57:09 GMT):<br/>
@drummondreed - sort of.  So at the start of the relationship, they both store locally a not-published DID and shared public/private key pair (via Diffie-Helman), and if they lose contact, one puts the agreed to DID on a ledger with an endpoint. That endpoint is presumably built to handle a Dead Drop and does something - not quite sure what - to help them re-establish communications.

I would recommend getting someone to write that up so the reference to that in the DKMS document was better.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 17:02:34 GMT):<br/>
Is an alternative to this that if one side has a public DID, they issue a verifiable credential to the other, and on loss of contact, they use the public DID and the credential to kickstart reestablishing their relationship?
</p>

@kdenhartog found the issue - i had started the nodes with incorrect nodenames (node 1 was node4, etc)
so far the cluster works. however I get stuck on the how-to's, step 2's output is this:

```2. Open pool ledger and get handle from libindy

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 18:49:09 GMT):<br/>
Are you submitting the transaction from the wallet CLI? This looks like the transaction successfully completed and the sdk should be able to update the wallet accordingly.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 18:51:51 GMT):<br/>
I just checked with someone and it sounds like it is getting stuck. I'll have to take a look at this in more depth to see if I can get a better understanding of what's causing this problem. So it sounds like you made it to step 2 in the getting started guide in Indy-Node is that correct?
</p>
<p><strong>samadsajanlal</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 18:57:40 GMT):<br/>
hey - I just got it to run through all of them. I reconfigured everything from scratch and it appeared to work fine... zipped through the entire how to for write & query verkey. to sum it up, the issue was in the configuration. I ran this command before:
```generate_indy_pool_transactions --nodes 4 --clients 5 --nodeNum 4 --ips '191.177.76.26,22.185.194.102,247.81.153.79,93.125.199.45'
This node with name Node4 will use ports 9707 and 9708 for nodestack and clientstack respectively```
with my respective IPs... but I didn't take care to look at the order that I put them in. So... node 4 was actually node 1, node 2 was node 3, so on. once I redid this with the correct order, and edited the docker_pool_transactions_genesis file respectively.... it worked

@mboyd - no.  To this point, we've been communicating between Issuer/Verifier Agents and TheOrgBook - a specialized Holder, and not worrying much about more generalized messaging.  As such, the Issuer/Verifier Agents have been hitting HTTPS endpoints of TheOrgBook.  We've done some planning on messaging and even some consideration of Cloud Agents, but haven't worked on that yet.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 10 May 2018 22:20:30 GMT):<br/>
I think the plan is to make a single endpoint with a message payload, but the protocol hasn't been worked out yet.

<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Thu, 10 May 2018 22:20:48 GMT):<br/>
Using indy-sdk, how would we set the endpoint of a DID and retrieve it from the ledger. libindy seems to lookup the endpoint in the wallet before looking on the ledger, so if you are only running locally and not looking up another DID on the ledger, it works fine.

We build an attribute request and sent it to the ledger, but we aren't able to get it back out from another running process looking it up on the ledger. We're not sure if it's actually being set on the ledger, though.

@mboyd the standardization of message formats is currently being worked out in DIF I believe, so we can make them interoperable as well. @TelegramSam would know the latest state of where that's currently at.

@dbluhm - AFAIK no one has progressed to that point, at least publicly.  If there is something that has gone to that level, I'd love to see it :-).
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 11 May 2018 22:38:44 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran lol me, too, it seems... On just a theoretical level, though, there wouldn't be a way to know unless the encrypted message was wrapped with some kind of meta data, right?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 11 May 2018 22:46:19 GMT):<br/>
Yes - the message is basically an envelope with some meta data and a (likely) encrypted payload, with enough information to decrypt it and see what happens next.  There could be multiple layers of envelopes, encryption and routing in the message.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 11 May 2018 22:48:42 GMT):<br/>
I've seen a good presentation that @danielhardman did on this as the message is passed from person 1 to person 2 via their respective edge agents and cloud agencies and agents.  It turns out there are a lot of layers - many of which are just go-betweens that are not privy to the actual message being passed.

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 11 May 2018 22:56:05 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm We are using libsodium. I think it packages the encrypted bytes in a way that allows us to tell which is which. However, I don't know the details. @gudkov would know.

Slides for the presentation that @swcurran refers to are at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H7KKccqYB-2l8iknnSlGt7T_sBPLb9rfTkL-waSCux0/edit -- and on the title slide, there's a link to a recorded version of the presentation.

@danielhardman Oh, interesting. The current indy-sdk wrapper and getting started guide don't seem to reflect that, unfortunately (from what I could tell at least). Thanks for the reference; it was very informative -- especially the "mail clerk" idea which I hadn't grasped quite yet
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 11 May 2018 23:25:25 GMT):<br/>
Sorry, to be more specific, the getting started guide doesn't seem to make use of inferring the -cryption type

 hello ! I am working on the python wrappers, but I have some questions : when we create a ledger configuration, what does it exactly mean ? more like a copy of the ledger or a copy of all information about nodes .. ?, and when the prover receives a claim from the issuer and stores it with the functions anoncreds.prover_store_credential where is it stored ? I can't find any of the exchanges done through python wrappers stored somewhere ? can you please help me figure this out ?

<p><strong>aaronr</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 14:51:42 GMT):<br/>
Not sure if this is strictly an agent question or not.  Any guidance would be helpful.  But has anyone given any thought to disconnected/offline user agents running on mobile devices that connect to each other over Bluetooth?  No reason that a proof request and response couldn't be done this way.  But the verification is going to be a gotcha since the signature of the issuer on any of the attributes submitted for the proof can't be verified.  Has any thought been given to chaining like with certs?  So that I can still have some level of trust in the document assuming I know about one of the certs in the chain?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 15:03:44 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 16:19:30 GMT):<br/>
Yes, but I'm still probably a week away from having a fully coherent description. I'll be raising a PR into the indy-rfc repo about it... I'm breaking the tests into "core" and "extensions" (where extensions may not be relevant to all agents). I'm also distinguishing between "inbound" and "outbound" tests. Inbound tests are those where an agent has to listen and understand; outbound tests are those where an agent actively requests stuff from others. Some agents might be passive listeners, whereas others might be proactive talkers.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 16:33:33 GMT):<br/>
The first coherent thing you'll see is a list of test descriptions. Later, I'll write code that uses the python wrapper around libindy to talk to an agent and, in an implemented test suite, prove its behaviors.

Also, as @dbluhm and I build the ref agent, we are trying to understand how dids, verkeys, and endpoints are stored in an agent's wallet and also on the ledger. 
Here is our process for sending and handling a connection request. I think we've accidentally mixed some of the ledgerless did theory into our design, and I'd love for someone to set us on the right path. 

In our current design (which we've pulled mostly from @danielhardman's 'how dids, keys, and credentials work' doc), when a connection request is sent, the sender agent A
1. creates a new did and verkey for the transaction, and stores it in their wallet. 
2. sends their did, verkey, and endpoint in an out-of-band channel (or us, it's an http post request) to agent B. 

then agent B:
1. Accepts request
2. creates new did and verkey for the relationship ( did@B:A & vk@B:A), stores it in wallet as my_did.
3. stores agent A's did and verkey in wallet as  ( did@A:B & vk@A:B)
4. creates a pairwise connection with did@A:B & vk@A:B and did@B:A & vk@B:A, and stores that in wallet 
5. stores agent A's endpoint somewhere... (see below)
6. creates a connection response, anon_crypts the data with agent A's verkey that they sent over, then sends agent A --> did@B:A, vk@B:A, e[B] (endpoint of B) back to agent A. 

agent A handles the response by:
1. anon_decrypting message
2. creating pairwise connection and storing it in wallet.

This looks virtually identical to what Evernym has done, although I'm not sure about your use of anon(de)crypt versus auth(de)crypt in the flow.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 19:27:45 GMT):<br/>
Looks pretty good - nice to see written :-).   A couple of notes:

* I would suggest that a DID Doc be used for sending/storing DIDs.  So on 2 in Connection Request is "Send the DID and DID Document in an...".  That also solves the question in 5.
* Hadn't thought of where the pairwise relationship data goes, but I had assumed it would be outside the wallet, but maybe inside the wallet makes more sense.

</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 19:30:05 GMT):<br/>
I don't think we encrypt on the backchannel. But once we have have DIDs and verkeys, I think we may.

<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 19:32:18 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran looks like the indy api has a `set_did_metadata` signature. Would the Did Doc be stored in the wallet as the did's metadata? Also, I found this [did doc spec in the sovrin protocol](https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/blob/b3f2a6c0d29e9d581bffcc3e9dcf4a28e5df75ed/spec/did-method-spec-template.html#L182), but it's telling us to store it on the ledger wheres from what I understand, we're storing dids in the agent wallets

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 19:33:56 GMT):<br/>
I believe that would work.  While the DID doc is used for the ledger, I would think we want to use the same format for the pairwise relationships.
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 19:36:46 GMT):<br/>
honestly, I still don't understand at what points an agent should write a did/did doc to the ledger. Is there a reference to when that happens?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 19:37:58 GMT):<br/>
The Sovrin protocol repo is an embodiment of lots of thinking, and I hope we begin converging around it over time--but its coverage is uneven. I wouldn't attempt to implement anything there without talking about it more broadly to get a read on how complete and accepted the thinking is.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 19:38:14 GMT):<br/>
A public DID should update its DID doc on the ledger any time something in the DID Doc changes.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 19:38:56 GMT):<br/>
"metadata" in indy sdk doesn't refer to DID docs; it refers to application-specific data that some vendor/developer wants to associated with a DID in the wallet.

@mboyd - a DID is written to the ledger if they need a public endpoint - analogous to a public URL for website.  When creating a pairwise relationship - no need to write it to the ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 19:40:08 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman - but that metadata could be in the format of a DID Doc, couldn't it?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 19:41:06 GMT):<br/>
Yes, the metadata could contain a DID doc. But that would be a quirky path to take. Would work; would just be odd.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 19:42:45 GMT):<br/>
It's probably the best solution we have for the time being, *if* you want DID Docs to go into wallets. In a month, when Darko Kulic's work on searchable wallets with non-secret data is offered to master, there will be a better way. And a couple months after that, when we finally get around to microledgers, we'll have a good and permanent solution. Microledgers are just ledgers for pairwise--so the DID Docs would go there.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 19:43:08 GMT):<br/>
vs. what?  If I get a DID from another endpoint, I get a GUID (the DID), possibly one or more verkeys, possibly one or more endpoints.  All those would be in the DID Doc.  Wouldn't it best to just use the DID Spec to store the data?

what do you mean by "use the DID Spec"?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 19:43:56 GMT):<br/>
As in the format defined in the DID Spec.  The JSON/JSON-LD Document.
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 19:44:19 GMT):<br/>
So when an agent is created for the first time (let's say for someone like alice, not an org like faber),  it should write a public did to the ledger with a did doc, so that its endpoint is publicly reference-able, and then create pairwise dids/verkeys  for each connection it makes with other agents. When two agents want to connect, they reference each other's public did on the ledger, but sign and send messages using their pairwise dids and verkeys. Yes?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 19:44:36 GMT):<br/>
I'm not making any claim at all about doc format. Of course we'd use the format from the DID Spec. I'm only talking about *where* we store the data.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 19:46:29 GMT):<br/>
OK - I am making a claim about the format :-)  As in what would be stored in the wallet.  But, you're right, not crucial.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 19:48:54 GMT):<br/>
@mboyd - not necessarily. There may not be a reason for Alice to ever have a public DID.  She could "find" Faber using it's Public DID and attempt to connect by creating a pairwise DID for the relationship.  She wouldn't need a public DID in this case.  She proves her identity later, using Verifiable Credentials.  Initially, she is just creating a communication path with Faber.

I guess I've been wary of storing correlatable data outside of a wallet. Daniel and I have been making a more generic peer 2 peer use case - like if alice and bob want to send messages to each other using Sovrin. If alice and bob want to connect using to each other over the sovrin ecosystem, neither of them will have public dids on the ledger, and won't really have a need to use the ledger until something needs to be verified - like a credential - for a more formal transaction. 

In this case, if metadata for each DID in the wallet is application-specific data that some vendor wants associated with a DID,  then alice can just store bob's endpoint in her wallet with his did and verkey in the metadata, or I guess could also store it in some sort of other persistent data store like a traditional web app

The use of the wallet makes sense.  

One thing to consider is adding a Cloud Agent to the picture - as the DKMS document shows.  If the Cloud Agent is purely for transport of messages and the endpoint is generic and uses the destination DID for internal routing (Agency to Cloud Agent) and for routing to the Edge Agent, that can eliminate some further correlatability.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:10:01 GMT):<br/>
That brings me to something else I've been thinking for a bit. @danielhardman - would love to get your thoughts on this. 

What if a pairwise relationship always had two keypairs for side - one for the pairwise relationship between the two identities at the edge, and a second for encryption to the endpoint - e.g. for message transportation?  If the Agent was acting on it's own (no Cloud Agent), it would create both keypairs itself, and expect to receive the message encrypted with the transport keypair.  

However, this also works if the Identity has a Cloud Agent. In creating the DID, Alice's Edge Agent would request the Cloud Agent create, remember (associated with the DID) and return the verkey and endpoint to the Edge Agent who would put both into the DID Document to send to Bob.  Then, regardless of the routing between the Endpoint to the Edge Agent, the other Identity (e.g. Bob) knows how to encrpyt the message to the Alice's Endpoint and how to encrypt/sign, etc. messages only for Alice.

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:15:24 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran, I want to be really picky for just a minute about semantics. Technically, the keypairs per side are actually *per agent*. Alice herself doesn't have any keys; she's a human being who can't speak bytes-on-a-wire. Only the agent on her phone has keys. So when we use the shorthand phrase "Alice's keypair for the Alice~Bob relationship", we are really implying that Alice has a keypair for one particular agent that she uses in that relationship. If Alice has 3 agents that she uses in the Alice~Bob relationship (whether those 2 agents are both edges, both clouds, or a mix), then she has 3 keypairs.

With that on the table, I think what you're suggesting is that Alice share a key for endpoint encryption across all her agents. Am I right?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 20:29:33 GMT):<br/>
Agreed on the semantics.

No on the question.  The Cloud Agent has an endpoint and for Alice's A:B relationship, it creates a keypair, keeps the private key and sends the public key to Alice with the Agency endpoint.  Alice puts the endpoint and that public key (for transport encryption) into the DID Doc.  Her Edge Agent also generates a keypair that goes into the DID Doc for message encryption that her Cloud Agent doesn't know. Bob's Agent then has all it needs to communicate with Alice's Edge Agent and to encrypt the message to the endpoint.

We are assuming that Alice and Bob have a "public" DID that is associated with the endpoint, but that other DIDs can be private to encrypt other messages with underneath that public DID. Therefore, all messages sent to and endpoint are anon-crypted to the endpoint which wraps the message structure above. The outer message of the public DID would look like:
```{
  message: <base64 encoding of an encrypted message of the above message types>
}```

The public DID encryption would always be anon-crypted, but the inner message would depend on the message type. Depending on the message type, the `message` of the message types would also be a base64 encoding of encrypted data.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 15:07:49 GMT):<br/>
@mhailstone - so the public DIDs for Alice and Bob are for transport, and the private DIDs for P2P communications?  That's interesting.  I was thinking the transport DID would be within the pairwise relationship to reduce correlation.  The Cloud Agent would have a unique keypair per P2P relationship.  That may be overkill, but this is where my lack of experience with correlation threats comes in. Listening to Nathan has got me thinking about it everywhere.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 15:17:23 GMT):<br/>
In thinking through your sequence diagram, I thinking that the model for "finding" others needs to be thought through to humanize it.  As was stated at Rebooting Web of Trust - if a person in the public sees a DID, we've failed :-).   What current world and real world mechanisms can we use in bootstrapping a connection?  QR codes and anything that can embed a reasonably complex URL are obvious.  Introductions from one person to another using Agents would seem possible.  It seems there needs to be a way as easy as an email address to initiate the connection.
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 16:03:36 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran For sure, how the UI renders the connection request and other messages definitely needs to be humanized. :) For the demo we did with Microsoft, the logged in user clicked a button on the website page that generated a custom protocol request `did-auth://?jwt=<jwt>`. The JWT had the connection request in it, but the browser on the device understood the custom protocol and displayed the option to the user to choose to disclose their DID in response to the request. That generated the connection response that went back to the server. (in the connection request was contained the endpoint). We then linked the DIDs together and generated a digital diploma and then sent the digital diploma to their endpoint of their DID.

On the point above about correlation we definitely need to figure that out. I've been trying to wrap my head around it as well. You either have the correlation of the endpoint, or the agent (Cloud Agent, Agency, whatever kind of agent we want to call it) internally will know the correlation of DIDs that it's managing.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 16:10:19 GMT):<br/>
I think with an Agency, the endpoint correlation is less likely - the same message type with an encrypted payload goes in for all Agents of the Agency and there is internal mapping for the DID to Edge Agent relationship.  Important is to have enough users of an Agency.
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 17:13:17 GMT):<br/>
@mhailstone - I like the format for your types: `type: "urn:sovrin:agent:message_type:sovrin.org/connection_offer"` is this syntax defined anywhere? (probably in the did spec, which I still need to read)

we have not yet implemented the concept of a `connection offer` or a `connection acknowledgement`, but I think these messages make sense, and allow greater extensibility of ways in which two agents can connect. 

In regards to which DIDs are stored where, you are saying that when Alice and Bob create their agents for the first time (let's assume that they are not using any intermediary agents/agencies), They will both write a did to the ledger with a did doc that contains their endpoint, Their verkey, verkeyID, etc, and when Bob receives a connection offer from Alice, he will:
1. use her did to get her verkey and endpoint from the ledger
2. send a connection request with that information

If the connection is direct, the data on the ledger will be correlatable with their edge agents (the agent's direcly under their control), right? So are you assuming that their will always be cloud agent intermediaries when A and B want to communicate?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=dqYWdv8zb7u8db8AY) @swcurran Exactly. If you have an Agency, then the endpoint is obfuscated away, but I think the Agency needs to have a "public" DID on the ledger that has a known endpoint. All messages for the Agency need to be anon-crypted for the public DID, then the Agency can decrypt the message and see who the message is really for. The internal message is encrypted (whether anon or auth) for the intended DID. The Agency would know all the DIDs that it is managing and would therefore be a point of correlation.

On the other hand, if you have an Agent for one owner, then the endpoint of that Agent would be the correlation point because every DID pair would have the same endpoint configured with it.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=E5rHAhvcmXegxZEkg) @mboyd @mboyd I tried to follow the URN convention, but if the community likes this format, I am definitely open to changes that makes sense. I just wanted a message type convention that would protect against collisions.

Concerning the data configured with the DID, I would recommend that if the DID is not on the ledger, or if the DID doesn't have the DID document on the ledger or an endpoint attribute configured on the ledger, then the use of the connection offer is important. The connection offer actually provides that information. You could insert that information in the connection request as well, but the connection offer is a way to provide that independently and not put too much correlating information in the connection request. The connection offer may be unnecessary, though, and we can discard it if we want to put everything in the connection request.
</p>

The convention for the URN was that other organizations could create their own message types:
`urn:sovrin:agent:message_type:byu.edu/ces_transcript`or something like that. If we want to reverse the order of the domain name, we could do that as well:
`urn:sovrin:agent:message_type:edu.byu/ces_transcript`

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 18:30:55 GMT):<br/>
@mhailstone - re: urn - the DID Spec talks about service endpoints and I know that @drummondreed  was pushing on including examples of how they are to be dereferenced.  See: https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#service-endpoints.  That might be helpful in what you are doing.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 18:55:09 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman - regards my thought above about DID Docs and having the DID Doc include the Edge2Edge and Endpoint Keys.

I'm going through your Love Letters document, and the "Initial State" drawing - which is tricky to understand.  However, if we use that "convention" for the contents of a DIDDoc (and related private keys) then we just have to say that each of the four Agents possesses DIDDoc:AB and DIDDoc:BA, and we know who can talk to whom.

In other words, DIDDoc:AB implies a bunch of details that need not be specified again:

* There is a unique DID related to the DIDDoc
* Alice's Edge Agent owns/controls the DID and DIDDoc (can update the DIDDoc - key rotation etc.)
* Alice's Edge Agent owns/controls the public key for Edge2Edge encryption, etc. - has it in it's wallet
* Alice has a specified service endpoint
* Alice's Endpoint Agent (her Edge or Optional Cloud Agent) owns the public key for Endpoint encryption - has it in it's wallet
* All of the keys, etc. relate to Alice's relationship with Bob

The DID/DIDDoc may be on the ledger (public and resolvable from just the DID) or only shared pairwise.
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 19:28:02 GMT):<br/>
Here are some questions that have driven our thoughts and design:
- What does a relationship look like?
- What is the structure of message type?
- Is the exclusive functionality of an Agency to route messages to Cloud Agents?
-- Agency must put public DID on the ledger
-- Cloud Agents must register DIDs in the Agency so the Agency knows how to route messages for them

- Does an endpoint attribute on the ledger only hold host or IP address and port? (We can't put a whole URL as the endpoint currently.)
- How does the agent know who the connection request is from? Does it look it up on the ledger as well as any DID attributes configured with it on the ledger?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 22:33:40 GMT):<br/>
@mhailstone  - good questions.  On the ones of which I have an opinion:

* Technically, I think the relationship includes - the history of: DIDDocs for the pair,  references to Verifiable Credentials exchanged, human-friendly references to the parties.
* Is the exclusive functionality of an Agency to route messages - mostly. Will do things like enable registration and updates, but in general - yes.
* Agency must put public DID on the ledger - Not really - perhaps for discovery, not for message routing. Agency maintains a DID to (internal) Agent routing table, and DID to Edge Agent routing table (may be a different DID - not sure)
* Cloud Agents must register DIDs... - yes - I called that a routing table

* Endpoints must meet DID Spec, so will be able to use URLs soon.
* How does the agent know who the connection is from? -  Too much for a Friday afternoon before a long weekend. My gut is the Agent doesn't care and uses Verifiable Credentials to resolve who. Until a VC from an "acceptable" issuer is received, the Agent doesn't notify the human about the connection.  This prevents unsolicited spamming.
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 23:30:53 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran - thanks for the responses, here are my added thoughts to yours
- relationships -> paired DIDs, DIDDocs and any attributes associated with the DIDs, references to all exchanged message types including: VCs, proof reqs/proofs, connection reqs/responses/etc.
- agency -> I'm seeing this as the agent with a configured endpoint or eventually a DIDDoc with an endpoint (the chain of communication might look like Edge Agent -> Cloud Agent <-> Agency <-> Agency <-> Cloud Agent <- Edge Agent) The Agency has a routing table for the Cloud Agent, the Cloud Agent is queried by the Edge Agent to consume messages. The ratio would be Agency *:* Cloud Agent, Cloud Agent 1:1 Edge Agent. The Cloud Agent is a place holder for messages that the EdgeAgent retrieves and then decrypts for processing. The problem I see with this is that the chain of encryption would have to be understood by each end of the message construction/deconstruction process on each side. With this said, Agencies would have a well known DID with an endpoint that messages can be sent to.
- Who is the connection from? -> We are assuming that the user needs to accept all connection requests and interactions and will probably give them a name. Hopefully most of the time the user will know the entity that invoked the request, but definitely that doesn't have to be the case. I suppose either way a DDOS attack of connection requests could happen. Not sure how to prevent that because a new DID can be generated for every new connection request.

Too much for a Friday sentiment shared here and I'll probably have a different opinion on Monday. ;) Thanks for the dialog!

@jonathanreynolds As a follow up to the indy WG call, @mboyd, @mhailstone, and I have all been working on creating the reference agent (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent) that @nage mentioned. We're still working through the early stages but we'd love to talk about our progress and yours sometime. We try to keep up here on Rocketchat and it'd be great to talk in an Agent WG call as well.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 16:05:14 GMT):<br/>
As mentioned in the Indy WG call, we would like to start up a dedicated Agent WG where we can have discussions (there is a lot to talk about).  What day/times will work, and does anyone want to volunteer to be considered for chair of that discussion group 
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 22:42:00 GMT):<br/>
Questions:
How does an agent identify who the connection offer/request/response is from?
If we use exclusive pairwise identifiers, is there meta information with the connection transaction that can be used? Does the pairwise identifier (their_did) refer to an alias DID on the ledger that is well-known?
Could we use a new message type that is for identification of the pairwise identifier (their_did)?
Even with a new message type, how are we sure the DID is who it says it is?
I suppose this goes into the Web of Trust concept. If we reference an alias DID, the issuer is probably a well-known DID that is a good pattern to follow in referencing. But, if I'm not an issuer (yet) what would I use as the requesting agent?

<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 22:54:18 GMT):<br/>
What is the distinction between private DID pairs and issuer DIDs if one of the parties in the connection is an issuer?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 23:09:08 GMT):<br/>
@mhailstone - an issuer is identified by the DID tied to the Cred Def - not the DID used to communicate with the Holder. Further, the Credential uses a keypair also tied to the Cred Def and not related to either the DID tied to the Cred Def or the DID used for transporting the Credential.  As a result, it doesn't matter if the pairwise DIDs are on the ledger or not in relation to the  issuance of a Credential.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 23:11:28 GMT):<br/>
In addition, a Holder/Prover of a set of Credential uses it's link secret to prove to a verifier that it is the party to whom each Credential was issued.  Basically - it gives a piece of data encrypted with the link secret to the issuer to embed in the Credential, and then proves to the verifier that it has the link secret to decrypt that piece of data.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 23:14:07 GMT):<br/>
@mhailstone - regards your identity questions above. I think proving who you are is about the use of Verifiable Credentials. That is separate from establishing and using a connection - the DID layer.  You create a connection with another party, and then you send proof requests as appropriate to establish identity.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 23:19:26 GMT):<br/>
More fun - with DIDs:  It's really easy to transfer control of a DID to another party - for good or bad.  So depending on the needs of your use case - you may need to have the user prove (via VerCreds) every time they access the service (or at least every time they update the DID verkey) if you have to know some attributes of the controlling Identity.

Use Case - I sign up for a Liquor Delivery service and proof my age.  Then I change (rotate) the verkey associated with the DID.  The Liquor Delivery service needs to verify the age again, as the verkey could have been transferred to someone else that may not be of age.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 23:20:36 GMT):<br/>
I do agree that there could and should be metadata associated with the DID for convenience, but that should not be considered "proof" of identity.

Here is an expression of a scenario with DIDs and connections, credentials, and proofs:

Establish a connection between Alice (A) and Faber College (F) -> Pairwise_DID@A:F and Pairwise_DID@F:A
Faber College creates a DID and has it written to the ledger (either by itself as a Trust Anchor or by another Trust Anchor) and uses it to create a Credential Definition -> CredentialDefinition_DID@F

Alice's Wallet
- Pairwise_DID@A:F
- Pairwise_DID@F:A

Faber's Wallet:
- Pairwise_DID@F:A
- Pairwise_DID@A:F
- CredentialDefinition_DID@F

Ledger
- CredentialDefinition_DID@F

(This next point at least is what is in question in my mind.)
Faber uses the CredentialDefinition_DID@F to issue a credential to Pairwise_DID@A:F

In your ( @swcurran ) scenario, you also mentioned that Faber could issue a credential to a separate DID other than the Pairwise_DID@A:F, correct? I'm not sure where Faber would get that DID, nor how Alice's agent would decrypt the credential offer/credential as well.

Thoughts/clarifications?

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 28 May 2018 15:25:13 GMT):<br/>
@mhailstone  - I think you have it above. The paraphrasing of my wording is not what I meant but aligns with the layout you have above :-) - I was meaning that the DID associated with the Cred Def can be different from the pairwise one used to deliver a Cred to a Holder. That DID (generally) has to be public, so that a Verifier can dereference the DID to determine who is the Issuer.

What about getting these scenarios/understandings into something like a Google Doc to start (so that we can have heavy editing/commenting) and then once we get it close, into a github document?

We're in the midst of a little refactoring - so I'm not the right one to help you (not a developer), but I'll see about getting others to help.For integration with our TheOrgBook, the old way is permitify (https://github.com/bcgov/permitify) and the new way is von-x (https://github.com/PSPC-SPAC-buyandsell/von-x).  Both implement python issuer/verifiers that are driven by configurations.  The Wallet/Ledger/Verify and Issuer patterns are all built in.

If you aren't integrating with an instance of TheOrgBook, then they can give you much of the code for the issuer verifier based on von-agent.

Package von_base sets up prerequisites for von_agent. Package von_agent isolates only von_agent code, so a user can install it via pypi. Consult von_base/doc/agent-design.doc for everything to do with von_agent and von_base.

Packages von_connector, von_conx are obsolete, but used to implement a protocol to create claims, create and verify proofs, etc. The current generation of von_agent (1.x) acts as a back end to The Org Book etc, which take their own requests and delegate to von_agent back ends. Instances of von_agent 1.x do not communicate directly. Perhaps they will again one day, but the protocol is obsolete in any case as it builds on the indy data structures prior to revocation support, and the state of the art has moved on since then.

thank you @sklump, The reason I decided on using VON-Agent to create an agent was because I noticed IBM developed something similar here: https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain-Identity/indy-ssivc-tutorial . They used VON-Agent within each entity of the Alice use case.  
So based on your response, the latest IndySDK is incompatible with that demo as well, provided that the latest IndySDK code is used.  Which VON component is up to date with the latest IndySDK? Would it be permitify?

I have been dithering and not making the progress I wanted on my agent test suite work. I finally decided it was better to raise a PR against indy-hipe, to promote discussion, than to wait any longer. So here you go: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/12.

Explanation: This PR actually proposes 2 different HIPEs. One (in the agent-test-suite-interface folder) is a HIPE for the *harness* used by an agent test suite--it specifies how an agent will be exercised, what assumptions it will make, how results will be communicated, and so forth. The other (in the agent-test-suite-v1 folder) is a HIPE for an initial set of tests. The first folder is mature enough to merit deep consideration. The second folder IS NOT mature enough for that, but it should be a good conversation starter.

If you have time to think about this topic at all, I recommend that you start by reading https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/30713f72a1bbb2476ccafb5e2f297123d69b47fc/text/agent-test-suite-interface/README.md. The semi-finished material in the other folder will then make more sense.

I am hoping that these HIPEs, in an evolved form that the community buys off on, will be the basis for interoperability discussions in the Indy agent ecosystem, and that it will be used to define success criteria for reference agent contributions in indy-agent.

Great work @danielhardman . You inspired me to wrap up the work I've been playing with the past couple of months. It's an implementation of an agent framework for the dotnet platform.
It's built around the idea of message based communication and extensible message handlers. Each agent is configurable which messages/features it can support as well as the type of transport. In my example I used REST API, but the core implementation is transport agnostic as it's driven by the message protocol.
I was able to setup a docker compose to demo the entire flow, which runs an indy node, issuer agent service and a console client discovering and consuming the agent services.
I wrote a little bit of documentation explaining the technical approach for the framework. Happy to hear any feedback.

@tomislav - very cool.  Makes for a very nice inventory of the messages.  For those interested in set of messages defined checkout the list here - https://github.com/streetcrednyc/agent-framework/tree/master/proto

This is using Google's protobuf - https://github.com/google/protobuf - with, as Tomislav points out, many code generators to handle lots of details - except the implementation of what the handler does.  Cool stuff!
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 12 Jun 2018 00:11:04 GMT):<br/>
Thank you @swcurran . Next step would be to try and match the message format to the document you've been working on. Protobuf works nicely with JSON serialization - would be nice to work towards a standardized format. Looking forward to the Indy Agent call on Friday

Hey Folks - I've put out some feelers for suggestions on Message Protocol helpers (e.g. "Swagger for messaging" to enable code generation, documentation and test generation). Some smart folks responded and interestingly, both suggestions where based on Google's Protobuf.  I'm thinking @tomislav is onto something :-).

Suggestions to look at - gRPC (https://grpc.io/)- see inventory of tools - https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/awesome-grpc - gRPC is from google.

And NATS - https://nats.io/ - which is a CNCF project (Linux Foundation).  It doesn't look to me like NATS is what we would want, but I mention it because it is based on Protobuf.

When i inspect my docker containair containing indy-pool I have IpAddress=172.16.0.2, in my config.js file (/indy-agent/nodejs/config.js) the ip address is 127.0.0.1 should I change that ? 
Also the port of the container are as followed : 9701/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:9701 / 9702/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:9702 .... 9708/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:9708

@BreizhIndy You can specify the ip address of your pool with the TEST_POOL_IP environment variable, and without understanding your setup perfectly I would thing `TEST_POOL_IP=127.0.0.1 npm start` would do it.  How did you start the pool?

<p><strong>saholman</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 20:15:47 GMT):<br/>
Depending on how you got the pool running in the first place, you may need to rebuild it with the right ip address.  The default test pool in the indy-sdk repository must be built with the ip address it will be accessed at.  For example, I run the following two commands inside the indy-sdk repository to get it running on a specific ip address.  ```
docker build --no-cache --build-arg pool_ip=172.16.0.2 -f ci/indy-pool.dockerfile -t indy_pool .
docker run -itd --name indy_pool -p 9701-9708:9701-9708 indy_pool
```

<p><strong>saholman</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 14:24:46 GMT):<br/>
@BreizhIndy Some changes have been made to libindy in the last few weeks that we haven't pulled into our project.  I believe if you change the genesis txn data in indy/src/pool/index.js to match that found here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/samples/nodejs/util.js, that it might resolve the issue.  If not, we will be pulling the latest version of libindy and resolving any issues soon.

@saholman thanks I think that was the problem, the error 112 is now solved bu let place to an error 114 "Pool worker thread finished with erro CommonError(IOError(Custom{kind:InvalidInput, error: Invalid argument})"
</p>
<p><strong>saholman</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 15:09:43 GMT):<br/>
@BreizhIndy I haven't pulled the most recent version of libindy and gone through to fix the errors.  I'll take a look at it next week and I'll let you know.  If you can figure them out in the mean time that would be great! :smiley:

@PhillipGibb what Linux distribution are you using? If your using Ubuntu 16.04, this reference may help https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/libindy/ci/ubuntu.dockerfile#L38.  The version of libsodium needed is not available for Ubuntu 16.04, so you have to build it from source.

Here are my proposals for topics for Friday Agent Meeting:

* The use of a common message specification language - e.g. protobuf
* A two key/one endpoint approach for Identity to Identity (or Domain to Domain) communication
     * I'll add this into the Collected Wisdom docs - we can nix this if not needed
* Where to evolve the Protocol Section - Google Doc or HIPE or Sovrin Protocol Repo
* Messages for establishing connections - pre-assumptions, first contact, pairwise DIDs

@mhailstone, @kdenhartog, @dbluhm, @tomislav and others, please review and propose changes.

<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 15:52:31 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran @kdenhartog @dbluhm @tomislav et. al, here are some other action items in addition to the list above that were captured from the last Friday agent call:
* Discuss URN structure
* Discuss discoverability
* Begin identifying message families
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 16:01:40 GMT):<br/>
Good ones.  I think "message families" and "establishing connections" are similar - a deeper dive into the one connections family.  I like touching on the URN structure if people have good suggestions to improve what you have proposed - probably one of the first we should talk about.  

On the other hand, I would say that while discoverability down the line will be really important - especially for schema - we can push that to the Indy Team and the Roadmap - what are their plans?  
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 16:24:45 GMT):<br/>
I've added and bookmarked a write up about my thoughts on Domain to Domain communications document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mRLPOK4VmU9YYdxHJSxgqBp19gNh3fT7Qk4Q069VPY8/edit#bookmark=id.qcxsl1qpmq5h

Would love to get feedback - feel free to pooh-pooh the idea.  It seems useful to me, but may be too limiting

As to whether we discuss it Friday - if it is on the mark then it might be important for the protocol conversation. If it's not right, then we can just skip any discussion.

Thanks!

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=8adx9vES28xkjiybc) @PhillipGibb Can you give a little more information with your error?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 18:14:59 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=2tPDqBJZmFWt4FjmC) @swcurran It's my understanding that basically all of these topics could/should be proposed as HIPEs. Google Docs are good for formulating a proposals but, for eventually coming to a consensus, HIPEs seem like the best place -- especially as I don't think we've descended into Sovrin specific protocol yet.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 18:15:23 GMT):<br/>
@nage feel free to correct me if I'm wrong (or others lol).
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 18:51:14 GMT):<br/>
@burdettadam it is ok, I have given up trying to build an ubuntu container to run my app that uses indy-sdk, does not seem possible. So I have now started using the Sovrin Test network with way more success
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 18:52:48 GMT):<br/>
@burdettadam everything builds fine in my local mac evironment but I am unable to connect to the docker indy pool (hence my attempt to run my app in another container that uses the docker network)
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 19:05:06 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm  - agree that eventually things go into github, but not immediately and not necessarily as HIPEs. First, github discussions are IMHO not a very good way to get "into the ballpark".  I'd prefer to have an idea discussed to see if there is merit to a topic before it becomes a HIPE-type document in github.  Second, HIPEs are by definition Indy specific, and so some of these topics we are discussing will go into the cross protocol interoperability.

<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 19:08:28 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure exactly what you mean by "get in the ballpark" but if you mean community discussion and getting to the point to where a proposal can be made then that makes sense, for sure. If we want to have that kind of discussion using Google Docs, I think that's fine.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=LLkGva6wsZQyc9ho5) @PhillipGibb I ran into something similar on my mac. Have you edited the ip addresses in the dockerfile to 127.0.0.1? That enabled my connection
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 19:18:28 GMT):<br/>
@mjmckean that is where I started, but I just got timeouts when I tried to open a connection to the pool
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 19:18:55 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran For instance, we've already reached some level of agreement on the core message structure so moving discussion regarding that out of the Google Docs and started down the pipeline for formal acceptance is absolutely necessary.
</p>
<p><strong>mjmckean</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 19:19:12 GMT):<br/>
@PhillipGibb dm me and let's troubleshoot
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 22:18:34 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm - agree that we are there for the core message structure we're getting there and that can go in a HIPE. Same with the URN - there was enough acceptance to move it.  But something like what I put in today to the Google Doc - domain-2-domain messaging is definitely not ready for a HIPE.

@mhailstone or @saholman We are working at setting up the nodejs indy agent, and running into some initialization problems with the changes in indy-sdk, are you guys aware of what happened?
</p>
<p><strong>saholman</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 14:02:32 GMT):<br/>
@nage We are aware of the changes to the Indy-sdk but I don’t believe the node.js wrapper has been updated to support all of the changes.  I would be happy to do a zoom chat and take a look at it with you if you’d like!
</p>
<p><strong>saholman</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 14:06:09 GMT):<br/>
The easiest way to run the agent really is the docker container.  I believe it has Indy-sdk v1.3.  If you make any changes to the code and then rebuild the container it will contain your changes.  If you just want to run a single instance, then try ‘./manage build’ and ‘./manage start alice’.

</p>
<p><strong>hvandurme</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 14:34:11 GMT):<br/>
Yes, please let us know! Can't way to dig a little deeper
</p>
<p><strong>saholman</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 14:37:10 GMT):<br/>
@nage Can I get a few more details on the error you are getting?
Also, what version of libindy are you using?
</p>
<p><strong>saholman</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 14:56:57 GMT):<br/>
@nage @hvandurme When I build v1.3 (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/releases/tag/v1.3.0) of libindy and then run `npm install` and `npm start` in the nodejs directory of the indy-agent repository, everything runs great.  Indy-agent does not currently support v1.4 or v1.5 of libindy.
</p>
<p><strong>hvandurme</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 16:15:02 GMT):<br/>
@saholman we all took the latest build I think, so probably v1.5
</p>
<p><strong>hvandurme</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 16:15:37 GMT):<br/>
Most of us were getting this error when running npm start:
> indy-agent@0.0.0 start /Users/hadrienvandurme/Desktop/hhf/indy-agent/nodejs
> node ./bin/www

{ IndyError: CommonInvalidParam4
    at Object.callback (/Users/hadrienvandurme/Desktop/hhf/indy-agent/nodejs/node_modules/indy-sdk/src/wrapIndyCallback.js:15:10)
  name: 'IndyError',
  message: 'CommonInvalidParam4',
  indyCode: 103,
  indyName: 'CommonInvalidParam4' }
</p>
<p><strong>saholman</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 16:16:40 GMT):<br/>
Ok, give v1.3 a try.  It’s hard to keep up with the Indy-sdk guys 😉, and the wrapper for node.js hasn’t been updated for newer versions yet either.  That’s probably what was causing the issues.
</p>
<p><strong>hvandurme</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 16:17:25 GMT):<br/>
Will do and let you know if I run into any issues

@kdenhartog , @swcurran , @mhailstone , @saholman , @TelegramSam 
For those who were a part of the call today, your comments on the Core Message Structure HIPE would be greatly appreciated. If we can get everyone on the same page to at least some level, I think it will help facilitate meetings in the future:

https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/17
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 16:26:09 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm - agree.  What I struggled with in preparing the desk was how to present what the message would look like vs. transport. I intermingled the two - and sort of had to because of the topic.  But in future I'd like a definitive way to present a message in a deck.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 16:27:47 GMT):<br/>
For sure. Great work with that presentation today, btw. I think it ended up bringing up a lot of things that needed to be talked about. Looking forward to more discussion.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 16:28:05 GMT):<br/>
Separate from that concept -- I'd also like to know the assumptions built into to sending a message. What do I have to know and what is the sequence.  That can then become a given when we talk about higher level concepts - the connection process and the attestation flow, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 16:32:52 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=d1HZPOgzZsKFhhA7lH) @saholman Just noticed that this PR was merged recently: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/916
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 16:34:56 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm ill go in there and review it's proposal. Id also like to see this go into the Sovrin-foundation/ssi-protocol so that people outside the Indy community who we would like to interoperate, but are planning to build on non-indy ledgers can offer suggestions and feedback as well. Also, @swcurran great job on the presentation. I believe we're aligned on the necessity of this and I like the idea that it's time to start moving forward.

<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 16:40:42 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog I'm not familiar with that repo (looks new). Are we favoring using that repo for Sovrin protocol discussion over https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/protocol ? For instance, a defined core message structure seems like appropriate information for https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/protocol/tree/master/janus
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 16:42:41 GMT):<br/>
That is the proposed idea right now to move move away from the Sovrin brand and bring more people in and be interoperable with us. However, it will incorporate nearly the same information (my first draft is going to be copy-paste) and we'll move forward from there.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 16:44:59 GMT):<br/>
The idea is we don't want to say this is the way Sovrin does agent comms, but rather this is how all SSI does agent comms and so I've proposed making it a protocol separate from Sovrin and haven't heard push back on it so far.

<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 16:47:32 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog Sounds good, thanks. Also, I'm interested in more details on the Micro-ledger work you mentioned. Is there anywhere I can look for information on that? I've been thinking about off-the-ledger pairwise DIDs for a while and would like to know what's been developing.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 16:48:18 GMT):<br/>

@dbluhm @saholman - do one of you want to fix my slide deck messaging so that it better matches how we want to present the messages?  My intention was to show an Edge-to-Edge Message (Type: Proof Request) and several Agent-to-Agent Messages of Type: Forward.

* How do we show the message content vs. the wire content

@swcurran When you say message content vs. wire content, are you referring to the message content as the content being forwarded and the wire content as the full message that gets transmitted?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 17:08:44 GMT):<br/>
I think I might be misunderstanding what you're referring to but once I figure out what you mean, I'd be glad to make those changes
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 17:14:45 GMT):<br/>
In the call - Matthew was confused about how I laid out the messages - where I had put in the base64, anon-crypt and auth-crypt data.  Some of that is implied by the wire protocol - basically the outer base64/anoncrypt (I think).  What I'm looking for is to fix the presentation so that it is what "the group" (e.g. you and Spencer :-) wants to see when we communicate about what is in a message.  E.g. accurately show the data, but don't show things that are assumed.  But formalizing that, it's easier to have future discussions about (for example)  exactly how to do a connection sequence of messages.

Does that make sense?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 17:20:53 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, thanks for the clarification!
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 17:36:43 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog - I agreed to submit a HIPE, but what was in the presentation was not any requested change to Indy (os it doesn't "improve" Indy), but rather a proposed convention that would be followed by all Agent makers.  That sounds like it belongs in the ssi-protocol repo.  Agreed?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 17:38:35 GMT):<br/>
In my mind yes.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 17:52:21 GMT):<br/>
That's off from what I thought/was told. @nage, would you be able to give the official word on protocol discussion and proposals? I dont have any problems using ssi-protocol but just want to make sure im putting things in the right place
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 23:27:43 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran @kdenhartog @dbluhm I will take a stab at changing the presentation and comment on the HIPE. Sorry I haven't been able to get back to this discussion until now.
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 23:29:10 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog What were the different transport packaging options you were looking into?
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 23:34:06 GMT):<br/>
Also, a basic credential example that we want to focus our efforts on now is issuing a completed course credential. This is a simple example of what a completed course schema might look like:
```{
  course_name,
  class_id,
  instructors, (this is an array)
  grade,
  start_date,
  completed, (boolean)
  completed_date,
  competencies, (this is an array)
}```

Multiple problems:
- values that are arrays
- I could return multiple completed courses when fulfilling a proof request
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 23:34:24 GMT):<br/>
Picnic and Signal are the two right now. I think I want to hold off on changing things for now because AuthCrypt and AnonCrypt are working fine right now for us. I recognize that we'll need to at the very least tweak things (to work with other key types), but we can address that when problems actually come up rather than trying to be too foresighted and slowing us down. For now we'll focus on building around what we got and getting message format standardized.
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 23:37:36 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog Do you have links to those solutions?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 23:38:26 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 23:40:57 GMT):<br/>
signal: https://signal.org/docs/ but someone just pointed me to the noise framework (built from signal protocol and proposed by it's creator) which can be found here http://noiseprotocol.org/
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 23:59:45 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran i think signal has solved the problem I was discussing earlier today. I need to investigate more, but here's a high level overview https://signal.org/blog/private-groups/
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 30 Jun 2018 00:03:04 GMT):<br/>
Think of the server as the message forward receiver in context of your proposal you made.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 30 Jun 2018 03:19:11 GMT):<br/>
@mhailstone - I think that it's an app protocol issue whether multiple proofs are returned for a proof request - e.g. that it should be handled by the verifier agent. 

The general problem of handling an array is a crypto issue as I understand it.  I suppose in some cases (and it might work in the case you have), there could be an agreement that "instructors" and "competencies" is a comma separated list or something, but that would be case by case.  And it definitely feels like a hack.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 30 Jun 2018 03:35:14 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog - very cool! - when we were in Salt Lake City we were talking about that as a way to distribute messages - pairwise encrypted symmetrical key. That would definitely work for messaging. 

For me - the really tricky part (to me) with multiple devices is with verifiable creds, where there is a different link secret per device.  You basically need the cred to be different per device.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 30 Jun 2018 03:38:39 GMT):<br/>
@mhailstone one option you could try is a proof request of address 1 the another with address 2 and they all have the same fields

With the Indy-agent repo now online it is appropriate to make a HIPE.  I think the idea of the SSI-protocol repo was to work on what would need to go into a set of HIPE proposals.  So your call on if it is ready yet or not

@kdenhartog I looked at those links and I would really like to have you present the differences of the protocols and/or the suggestions you have to incorporate one of those protocols as our adopted protocol. From a brief overview reading, I'm leaning towards the Noise Protocol (http://noiseprotocol.org/noise.html).
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Sat, 30 Jun 2018 20:20:18 GMT):<br/>
I am not a cryptographer, though, so this is simply a "looks good" opinion.

<p><strong>ArthurManz</strong> (Mon, 02 Jul 2018 08:16:17 GMT):<br/>
Good morning from Amsterdam! I was wondering why should we use NONCEs in the indy-agent repository. It requires session management, would it be not easier to use JSON Web tokens where we can send enough information in its payload to match the requests?
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Mon, 02 Jul 2018 15:18:08 GMT):<br/>
@ArthurManz The nonce isn't necessarily used for session data but state information in creating a connection and how to route the request. Very similar to session data, but I would suggest that it's more state logic about the connection that's being created that it isn't session data. I'm open to others' interpretations, though. Just thought I'd give me two cents. :)

I have deleted the file `$HOME/.indy_client/wallet/alice_wallet/wallet.json`, because *xtype* is not compatible with WalletDescriptor in 1.5

OLD:
`{"pool_name":"pool1","xtype":"default","name":"alice_wallet"}`
NEW (1.5):
`{"pool_name":"pool1","type":"default","name":"alice_wallet"}`

WalletDescriptor was changed:

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=CRrdECfuBYR8NeLcE) @BreizhIndy Yes that is the expected behavior.  In this little demo we've tried to find the balance between making the user do everything and abstracting some of the details away.  What do you mean you can have a relationship with the same DID multiple times?  The same endpoint did? The pairwise or relationship DIDs should be different for every relationship?

I've had time to skim it and will read it more deeply shortly.  A big assumption that stands out is the sharing of the link secret.  I had thought that a link secret needs to be handled like a private key - e.g. not moved, so hadn't thought of that as possible. 

What do others think of a link secret that is shared?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 05 Jul 2018 23:19:34 GMT):<br/>
If that is permitted from a crypto/security basis, it does make things a LOT easier.

From our work on DKMS, we were torn on whether a link secret needed to be shared or you could a Sovrin wallet work across multiple devices using a derived link secret. @MALodder or @kdenhartog can go deeper on that debate.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 06 Jul 2018 19:10:59 GMT):<br/>
The discussion today about the potential for application level authority being assigned from an Identity (e.g. Alice) to Agents is an identical pattern to what we have been considering for Organizations (e.g. companies) delegating authority to their Human Agents - staff, lawyers, accountants, etc.  We held a session at IIW about this - http://iiw.idcommons.net/Delegation_of_Authority_for_Organizations_%2B_Services_w/DID%E2%80%99s_%2B_VerfCreds

I think that we should consider using/evolving this same model for delegating authority to Agents.  The service (e.g. UBS) provides information on the capabilities that can be used with its service, and the Identity owner can then delegate access to those capabilities to the agents. Ideally, that same delegation mechanism can actual be distributed beyond the Agents controlled by the Identity - per the document above, to delegating to other people (or more specifically, the delegates of other people).

I also feel like raising that kind of delegation above the DID communication level makes sense.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=ZgJtb3ctyPSnayoQ8) @swcurran I had always wondered where the term `authcrypt` had come from — thanks for the link!
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 07 Jul 2018 19:41:47 GMT):<br/>
Read through the HIPE on establishing a connection - good stuff.  I think we need to remove everything about routing from the HIPE.  The messages discussed should be just what Alice and Bob's Edge Agents (the ones that are connecting) need to see, and we should assume that the messages magically travel from Alice to Bob. In a separate HIPE we'll talk about the nuts and bolts of how such messages get from the one Agent to another - eg. how Alice's agent wraps the message for routing, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 07 Jul 2018 19:45:30 GMT):<br/>
In this HIPE the first message (offer) might have to be a special case of core sending when only one public key is known between the parties, anoncrypt must be used vs. authcrypt for the rest.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sun, 08 Jul 2018 18:29:31 GMT):<br/>
I'm looking through the indy-agent repo on the flow of sending proofs and requests for the General-Identity schema. I understand this is just an example. Would be nice to standardize the way parties exchange some information between them during (or right after) the connection establishment process, and General-Identity seems like a good way. Are edge agents assumed to just issue and store credential to themselves for this purpose? Their cred-def won't be on the ledger, but the proof request can be constrained to schemaId only.

Regarding authcrypt and anoncrypt: anoncyrpt is using libsodium's "sealed box" primitive (https://download.libsodium.org/doc/public-key_cryptography/sealed_boxes.html). The link @swcurran provided is also good. Authcrypt has the same properties as libsodium's public key authenticated encryption (https://download.libsodium.org/doc/public-key_cryptography/authenticated_encryption.html)--including the need for the sender's private signing key--but libindy's implementation uses a combination of sealed box and a signature. As I understand it, anoncrypt is embodied in a sealed box that contains a signed ephemeral (symmetric) key plus anon-encrypted plaintext. The signature proves that the ephemeral key was selected by the sender, and reveals the sender's identity--but only to the possessor of the recipient's public key. Once the overall message has been unsealed, the signature isn't repudiable but the recipient can't prove that said signature was associated with the plaintext message, because that association has now been broken. @gudkov or @sergey.minaev , can you please clarify?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=JfGa5GxbuqcTiBndM) @danielhardman authcrypt contains libsodium's crypto box and sender verkey wrapped with seal box. There is no explicit signature and proof of origin is based on checking of Diffie Hellman result from sender verkey and recipient private key. As result it is impossible to proof origin to 3d party without disclosing of recipient private key.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=T5LGWdgFfNekRbFrQ) @tomislav Under the covers right now, we have the "Government" issuing them an ID of some kind when the agent is starting up for the first time that all "General-Identity" proof requests are fulfilled with.  While something like this would be optimal, that first ID could be provided by a university or perhaps the agency itself when a new agent is added.  I think it makes sense to build up a known list of credential definitions that are trusted forms of identification rather then having it based on a self-attested attribute or self-issued credential.

@gudkov Thank you for providing more detail, but I still need you to clarify your sentence. One way to understand it would be: "authcrypt consists of libsodium's crypto box around the main message, followed by the sender verkey wrapped in a sealed box". Another way to understand it would be: "authcrypt is a single sealed box, inside of which there is a crypto box around the main message followed by the sender verkey outside the crypto box". I am guessing you mean the second interpretation. Am I right?

@swcurran I think we'll definitely have a need for a general transport HIPE but I'm also wondering if we need to treat the connection process with its own transport HIPE detailing some of the grittier parts of bootstrapping connections. What do you (and others) think?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 09 Jul 2018 16:45:12 GMT):<br/>
I agree that the first message (at least) of the connection message might be a bit special because only one DID is known, but I'm thinking after that, there should be enough info. From the second message on, both sides know the pairwise DIDs that will be used.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 09 Jul 2018 16:47:03 GMT):<br/>
Within a domain, the transport level messaging may have to share other information about DID-to-Agent routing. I'm claiming that such information will be part of the transport discussions between Agencies within a Domain.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=T5LGWdgFfNekRbFrQ) @tomislav @tomislav I think it really depends upon the purpose of establishing a connection. For some business domains, they may want certain data known to the domain to be asserted and they may not care about general identity. For example (and forgive me, but it may not be absolutely correct), if a bank wanted to just know that another institution was a recognized bank, then maybe the first proof request they would perform would be on receiving a proof of the other institution's ABA routing number. Once they had that proof of a number, then they could do certain business actions with the connection. I think @jljordan_bcgov mentions this a establishing a "relationship" on top of a "connection". I don't disagree that general identity proof requests would be generally useful for human to human connections, but I want to emphasize that we shouldn't automate that into the connection process but rather let the business process dictate what proof requests are useful inside their own domain.

@dbluhm @swcurran I think that whether a general purpose transport HIPE fits for creating connections depends on the definition and approach to the general purpose transport. Currently, the simple anon-encrypted/base64 approach works for both scenarios, but a new more sophisticated approach may not fit both scenarios in order to address inherent routing and forward secrecy.

I'm having fun trying to come up with the transport HIPE. It will need adjustments and evolution before it can be used, I'm sure, but I think it will make things a lot easier in the long run.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=pfEfQi4n43wobSpg2) @TelegramSam The only real difference between anoncrypt and authcrypt is the key that is used for signing and to encrypt. Anoncrypt uses an ephemeral key pair with the recipients public key to compute the encryption key to encrypt and sign the data. Authcrypt uses the senders key pair instead of the ephemeral key pair. Both use an Ed25519 private key to sign. Anoncrypt hides the sender.

Standardization regarding the agents is currently in the works, and I believe there are no low level technical documents explaining every nut and bolt.

libpbc.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Having this error for several days now and I cant get it resolved.

<p><strong>ghouston10</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 15:04:30 GMT):<br/>
Can anyone please help with me this error. I have been stuck at the same point for the last few days and have made zero progress. I am following what seems to be very basic instructions from this link 

https://github.com/bcgov/von-network#running-the-network-locally

I install docker and clone the von-network. I run ./manage build and ./manage start ,to start up the standard 4-node Hyperledger Indy network which executes successfully. I then open up a new terminal and run ./manage cli withinin the von-network directory and I receive the following error:

libpbc.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Is there anything that I need to install/run before I start following the instructions on this guide. It doesn't state that anything is required so I have no idea what is causing the error or how it can be resolved.

Any help would be much appreciated.

We will be conducting a 2 day workshop to work on the Indy Agent protocol/specification and interoperable implementations July 30 - 31. We will start 8:00 AM (MDT each day and end at 5:00 PM (MDT) each day with a 1 hour break at 12:00 PM (MDT). We will mainly be participating through a virtual zoom meeting. BYU will be hosting a location in Utah for those who would like to participate face-to-face. Contact Matthew Hailstone (matthew_hailstone@byu.edu) for details if you are interested in attending the face-to-face gathering in Utah. All participants should be up to speed on the Agent discussions and on the Agent Protocol related HIPEs. Please plan to attend at any portion of the workshop during those two days to participate/contribute to the discussions.

Here are the zoom meeting details for each day:

Here's a loose outline for JWMs. I suspect there will be lots of questions that I am ready to discuss to improve this. Also, I chose to place this in the SSI-protocol repo instead of a HIPE so that we could get active discussion from the larger community such as uPort and DIF folks.

Hey folks, attached is a HIPE about Transport Layer Messaging that I promised to take a shot at. This is likely far too simple to be complete and I offer it mainly to get the conversation going. As noted in the pull request - pictures are desperately needed and I hope to get to that soon, but I have some other work to do. 

The assumptions are "interesting".  I think they are reasonable, but they still leave much up to an implementation. 

I did not look at what @kdenhartog posted a short time ago and so don't know if that affects this.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 01:41:05 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran Daniel mentioned you were working on this and I forgot to reach out after he told me. Ill take a deeper look at it tomorrow. At first glance, we're looking to accomplish similar things and have common ideas. Yours definitely goes deeper into design philosophy so ill likely be copying most of that info in. Great job! We're moving quickly on this stuff.

@swcurran, some points of feedback on the transport HIPE.

1. I don't buy the strong form of the Sender Anonymity or Receiver Anonymity requirement. I'm not sure how these got entrenched in our thinking, because I agree with you that the community seems to have begun articulating these as fundamental--but I think we've gone a bit too far. If you think about sovereign nations in the non-digital world, and about heads of state communicating with one another, it is certainly true that one head of state need not know all the people and processes used by another head of state when delivering a message at the other kingdom's borders. But I think *some* knowledge may be reasonable (e.g., "I can give this to the postmaster and ask it to be couried directly to the palace without passing through the hands of the ambassador. It is for the king's eyes only." Such a statement implies a little knowledge about the internals of the other monarch's kingdom). Similarly, I think it is reasonable for one sovereign identity owner to know a little bit about the internals of another sovereign domain--enough to know which keys are considered closely held by the identity owner (at the edge) versus loosely held (in the cloud). The microledger spec further imagines that identity owners would tell one another what permissions are ascribed to each key that they intend to use in the relationship, so they can cooperate to enforce access. If Monarch A gets a letter purporting to represent the wishes of Monarch B, but it is only signed by Monarch B's postmaster, Monarch A needs to know whether B wishes the postmaster to be taken seriously....

The "Transport DID (TDID)" section lost me a bit. Are you intending to say that there is a DID and a key at which mail will be delivered for a sovereign domain, and that this DID+key is conceptually distinct from the other keys associated with the domain? In other words, that you may deliver to an endpoint which is serviced by a DID and key that are not in and of themselves "members" of the sovereign domain? (If so, then I am feeling fine about it.)

Why are we introducing DIDs instead of the lower level construct of keys as the operational input needed for wire messages? This would require every agent within a domain to have a DID. Instead, can we say that wire messages are sent to and from *keys*, not assuming that DIDs are necessarily involved? In a similar vein, do we always have to provide a DID as the target for a "forward" message, or could we just provide a key? (I have been assuming that agents within a sovereign domain have a locally unique name, but not a DID. There are some deep reasons for this that we could discuss in a separate conversation.)

We have to assume that message responses are asynchronous; to do otherwise eliminates many transport protocols. However, we could define a "synchronous mode" that would be supported by transports that allow it, whereby the deliverer of the message awaits a response and transmits it back immediately (e.g., without closing the port first). This would be great for http and would not be hard to build, probably.

"The choice of whether to use anoncrypt or authcrypt is based on the state of the known DIDs" -- I think this is only partly true. Even if it is possible to authcrypt, it must be a choice to anoncrypt instead. This allows Alice to send Bob anonymous love letters even if Alice and Bob know each other from work. (Whether Bob's agents are programmed to accept anonymous letters is another question.)

Your paragraph that begins "ASIDE: this is where": There is only one endpoint for a pairwise DID--the endpoint where mail can be delivered. I *think* that's what you're calling a TDID (though I don't understand why "DID" is in its name or its definition; I was thinking of it as an endpoint with a key, not an endpoint with a DID...). Anyway, It appears that you're imagining another DID and another endpoint here, which raised my eyebrows. So this is something I want to learn more about.

Application Level Error Handling: I think it may be desirable to provide a "reply-to" property with a message, that would allow errors to be reported. The problem is that, done wrong, this is a way to spam an unsuspecting third party with error messages. So we need to think about that. How do we detect transmission errors in physical post? We usually don't, unless we use a "return receipt requested" feature of some kind...

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 10:23:48 GMT):<br/>
Feedback on @ryanwest6 's connection protocol HIPE:

1. Offer and Request, then Response are part of a more generic pattern (I have been calling it a "flow") that can be used for any negotiation. It is not unique to connections, and I think we should reference the more generic pattern rather than treating it as special to connections. See https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/ssi-protocol/tree/master/flow/std/negotiate_msg. Note that there could be multiple rounds of offer->request or request->offer before the request and the offer are aligned and both parties accept. The point of negotiation in a connection might be the terms of the connection, or might involve some type of low-trust claim about who the parties are so they can recognize each other. Think about how LinkedIn Connection Requests work ("Hey, this is Terry. We met at the conference the other day. Let's connect." --> "Hey, Terry, this is Jim. You're not going to spam me with recruitment offers, are you?" --> "Naw. I just want to stay in touch." --> OK)

2. Either the Offer or the request can be out of band. Or both can. It is not until a connection response that the offer must move in band.

3. I think a connection offer and a connection request need a place for a freeform introductory message from one human to another.

4. We are missing the idea of topicalization and message thread sequencing as described
here: https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/protocol/blob/master/janus/message-packaging.md#topical-messages. This does not need to be in the Application-Level connection messages, but should be moved outside. I think the id of a message is redundant with this idea.

5. I see mentions of the public ledger. This must work for microledgers and private DIDs, too--not just agains the public ledger.

6. Why is the verkey attribute in a connection request not the same as the verification cay used to encrypt messages in transport? I would think that it should be.

7. I think there's a confusion about authcrypt and anoncrypt here. All messages delivered to a DID are packaged with a "forward" message and anon-encrypted when handed to the endpoint for that DID. That endpoint anon-decrypts and examines the resulting "forward" message to decide where to route it. The message is then routed to the agent(s) who own the DID, who may either anon- or auth-decrypt it (depending on whether the sender wanted to be identified; for connection responses, it should always be auth-crypted, probably). The result of this second decryption is finally an Application-level message like a Connection Request. We don't wait until after the connection is established to begin using this; we do it as soon as we have a DID to send to.

8. I question the value of the acknowledgments. We are talking about a disconnected, asynchronous protocol, where any message might be lost in delivery. Once both parties know that the other party has provided a DID and verkey, and that they have, they know that there's a two-way intent to be connected. Whether that connection is actually broken or working is not a concern unique to the connection protocol--it's a general concern of the channel no matter what messages get exchanged. And acknowledgments only partly address the need, because the minute after we deliver a message saying a connection is open, one side could change its mind and stop connecting. Thus, the acknowledgement doesn't really say, "I acknowledge that the connection is open when you receive it," but rather "At the time I sent this, I considered the connection open." But that would be true of *any* message sent by the other party; it's not uniquely conveyed by an acknowledgment.

Alice knows that Bob has provided a DID+verkey+url, and that she has, as soon as she sends her auth-encrypted connection response. Bob knows that Alice has provided the ingredients of a connection, and that he has, as soon as he receives her response. No additional info is learned after that.

You could say, "Well, Bob's acknowledgment lets Alice learn that Bob received her response." Fine. But so would any other message that Bob ever sends her. And if she doesn't receive this acknowledgment, she still knows that Bob intends to talk, since he's already sent her his DID. If talking isn't working at the moment, it's not a matter of intent, but a matter of a failed transmission mechanism. And guess what--the failed transmission mechanism will stymie the acknowledgement...

@swcurran @danielhardman I think a better word for Anonymity is Encapsulation.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:50:11 GMT):<br/>
I agree @TelegramSam - it's not that we want anonymity, its that we want to allow an agent to encapsulate it's implementation, revealing only what's necessary.  The more it reveals, the more other parties have to understand the conventions it is using. As with any interface, to achieve relatively arbitrary interoperability we want to be very careful in what conventions we declare as expected as if an specific implementation goes too far - it won't interoperate with anyone.

I've advocated it reveal the minimum from a transport perspective (endpoint, transport key), but could be talked up to including more.

Now that `libindy` API is heavily re-factored, is it possible to update reference agents in the `indy-agent` repo to reflect those changes, or at least to put info about the currently supported version of `libindy` in the README. I know people are trying to play around with the agent implementations and are facing issues because they are using Indy SDK master branch.

@danielhardman I'm a little confused at the purpose of a DID from your comments and recent discussion about DID and keys. I have been under the impression for a very long time that DIDs are the primary identifiers for identity holders and represent connections/relationships. The keys associated with the DIDs are used for encryption/decryption and signing/verification. It seems now that we are advocating keys as the primary "identifiers" for identifying the entity from whom or to whom the message is sent. Could you help me understand when DIDs are to be used on their purpose and when keys are to be used and their purpose? This distinction is crucial I think in correctly creating a transport layer structure protocol as well as a core message protocol.

@mhailstone In my view, a DID is an identifier for an actual or potential relationship between sovereign domains. One DID per relationship. Multiple entities may participate in a pairwise relationship -- various agents on either side, for example. The participating entities need to be uniquely identified so they can receive delegated authority that can be revoked as needed, and so they can be held accountable. They don't do this with DIDs; they do this with keys. Thus, keys are a delegation-of-authority mechanism, not an identification-of-relationship mechanism. What I've been hearing from others recently feels to me like it is conflating two very different dimensions of identity -- relationships vs. delegation -- and trying to use DIDs for both. Please see the first 9 slides of this preso, where relationships and DIDs are the blue axis and agents and delegated keys are the red axis: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B6XPzEeVaZFHv14y6JZ0f7Hdj0jnvTM99-9D-7Vbj4g/edit. To give DIDs to agents is to confuse the delegation and relationship axes. Relationships are established through a connection protocol such as the one in @ryanwest6 's excellent HIPE. That's how and where DIDs get created. Delegation is a unilateral thing that doesn't require this dance, and it's governed by keys. If we give DIDs to agents, then are we also going to do a connection protocol for between the various agents in the sovereign domain, and maintain a relationship state machine for every agent-to-agent relationship? And rotate keys via ledger txns?

The view has been asserted that identity owners should have no visibility into the domain of an other. I get the desire to encapsulate, but I think it's unrealistic to provide total opacity. As long as the phenomenon of proxying and delegation exists, another party must be told what the role of certain proxies might be. This conveyance of delegation config between two sovereign domains need not be very detailed--England and France don't have to tell each other the names and assignments of everybody in their respective diplomatic corps--but they do have to introduce one another to their respective ambassadors and prime ministers, and clarify what the responsibilities and authorities of those officials might be. Similarly, if one party in a relationship is a corporation has thousands of agents working on its behalf, and the other party is John Q. Public, there is no need for the corporation to exhaustively enumerate all its agents and keys to John. But it is reasonable for the corporation to tell John about the keys that will help him recognize two or three of the corporation's delegates that are relevant to their interaction.

Within the indy agent, when you create a credential definition, a post request is sent to /api/issuer/create_schema
Where is this code located and how can I access it, so I can understand what is actually executing.

Feedback on @dbluhm 's hipe about message type:
I think we need to distinguish between the need to describe the type of a message in two different contexts:

describe the type from within the message
describe the type from outside the message
The type that's visible inside a message is guaranteed to be there even if we divorce the message from its transport or context and save just the raw bytes of the message to disk. It is important to have this, so that messages can be self-contained. This is why JPEG files have an internal header that identifies them as JPEGs, PDF files have an internal header that identifies them as PDFs, and so forth.

However, a type declared internally is of no use to something that sees a message payload only as an encrypted blob of bytes. So we also need to declare type in a way that's external to the message itself, such that things that are processing the message (or routing it to other things to process) have the option of learning something about what they are handling.

The current proposal feels to me like it conflates these two concerns, placing a type declaration outside the message content but inside some other container that must unify the two.

The original A2A design called for a type declaration to be a message type of its own. You could take any other message and make it a payload of a type message. This is very close to what this proposal recommends, except that in the original view, the thing you were looking about when you were done wasn't a message of arbitrary type but guaranteed to have type as a field--but rather a "type" message that had another message as its payload. If we could think about it that way, I think we'd be better off.

@danielhardman - what is the "original A2A design"?  I'm not familiar with that.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 13 Jul 2018 12:29:05 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog - as I understand it - JWM is at the same conceptual level as the Indy-SDK anonCrpt/AuthCrypt (I'm not sure which) - e.g. it is about how a chunk of data (such as a message) is encrypted and decrypted. Is that right?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 13 Jul 2018 12:51:08 GMT):<br/>
When I used that phrase, I meant the design that is documented in the sovrin protocol repo at: https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/protocol/blob/master/janus/message-packaging.md#typed-messages

Calling it "original" may be a bit of a misnomer. It's the oldest design work on A2A that I encountered, at about a year old. And it underpinned the preso I gave about A2A way back in January. But it wasn't made visible to the community until IIW this spring, so it's not fair to think anybody else had seen it.

@swcurran Near the end of the call today, you mentioned the concept of multiple application keys being associated with a DID. Would a portion of those application keys be used for the internal routing from Alice's agent domain (1 -> 2 -> 8), or is the routing concern and configuration independent of the application keys?

@kdenhartog Also, from the call today, would we always want to couple the auth/anon crypt functions with returning a JWM result in the indy-sdk? Or, should there be a convenience function in addition to those available calls?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 13 Jul 2018 19:03:47 GMT):<br/>
@mhailstone I haven't found a reason where a JWM would be used to describe anything other than how a message was encrypted or decrypted. This is also why I've often referred to them as JWEs. We're essentially taking the JWE spec and tweaking it to our specific implementation to describe the encryption scheme and keys used to encrypt a message, so I saw it as valuable to strongly tie it to AnonCrypt and AuthCrypt. I'm open to creating a separate function API available (and think its the best way to do it), but I do think that Authcrypt/AnonCrypt should make those calls within it's method and return what the JWM formatter method returns.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 13 Jul 2018 19:04:26 GMT):<br/>
@mhailstone - independent of routing.  Basically - those additional keys would be for any Agent in the domain that is expected at some point to handle Application Level messages.  Whether or not any such agents also serve as a routing node is independent of that.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 13 Jul 2018 19:04:47 GMT):<br/>
Also, @swcurran was your presentation built off of this https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/protocol/blob/master/janus/love-letters.md

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 13 Jul 2018 19:07:56 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog - I did borrow part of the picture. However, I removed some of the pairing of the keys because it goes against the encapsulation principle of routing vs. application level. It was one of the documents that while perhaps technically correct and intended, generates the confusion between the application layer messages and routing.

@swcurran @mhailstone @kdenhartog @darrell.odonnell @ryanwest6 @nage @TelegramSam and anybody else who was on Friday's call: I got a bit heated about the question of whether TDIDs were DIDs. I apologize. I needed to be more open minded, because there were good ideas being shared.

By way of apology, I've been trying to think about the question more objectively, taking both sides of the debate and exploring where it leads me. I didn't get to any kind of closure, but I feel like the attempt was instructive. I wrote it up and offer it FWIW: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PvTfVgj2CEBozZb6HeZMQ0ab_zu2zd7tBbH8Hnq3mFM/edit?usp=sharing

I was going to begin working on IS-810 (the ticket to add multiple keys to an associated did_doc), but I get the feeling that we haven't reach consensus on the best way to achieve this based upon our call last Friday. In particular, I think we're stuck on the idea of if each agent would be given an associated DID, or if the agents keys and endpoints would be placed in the DID of the domain (identity owner). Either way works for me, but this decision does make a difference in terms of implementation, so I'd like to come to a collective decision on a good enough solution to move forward (and we can change it later if we need to). @danielhardman @gudkov @mhailstone @swcurran does anyone have a strong opinion on how to do this? I'll write up a doc sharing the implementation I had in mind and we can work from there.

hi, Within the nodejs indy agent, when you create a credential definition, by simply clicking a button, a post request is sent to /api/issuer/create_cred_def. 
Do you know where this code is located and how I can access it, so I can understand what is actually executing.

code:
<form method="POST" action="/api/issuer/create_cred_def">

The code is contained within a html class.

router.post('/issuer/create_cred_def', auth.isLoggedIn, async function (req, res) {
    await indy.issuer.createCredDef(req.body.schema_id, req.body.tag);
    res.redirect('/#issuing');
});

For those on the call last week - I think we've uncovered why there was confusion on the need/non-need for tracking "TID" - the key/endpoint for encrypting a message for EVERY agent.  For interoperability - we need to require that for messages going to a Domain Endpoint - eg. across Domains.  Within a domain - we need not require that, and Daniel (and probably others) assumed we wouldn't be doing that, while I assumed we would.  The correct answer is - it's up to the Domain to decide.  What is done within a Domain stays in a Domain and we don't need to monitor that.

I'm going to update the HIPE and the presentation I created accordingly and we'll see if that makes it easier to understand.

I've heard the term "Sovereign Domain" used a few times in calls and discussions, and I'd like to throw out a definition. Here is a draft description of a "Sovereign Domain":
A virtual boundary representing the data and control over data and keys (through agents and other potential mechanisms) that an Identity Owner governs. This may span over devices and agencies.

I was thinking that an Identity Owner would control their data across all devices and agencies, and this would constitute a "domain" or "sovereign domain". @swcurran, I'm seeing that your use of "domain" above is more consistent with the notion that a "domain" is the same as an "agency". I think I am misunderstanding the differences or nuances from both ideas. Are these ideas complimentary or in conflict? Thanks. :)

</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 18:32:47 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure I have all the pieces (I was a little confused by @swcurran's message) but I don't think it is intended that domain = agency. As I understand it, a domain is more like the area of influence that an identity owner has. The identity owner does not have control of the agency that they use but the agency is providing an endpoint for a domain nonetheless. I think that's what is meant by a domain endpoint here -- or, in other words, the point of entry into a domain from without it.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 18:41:33 GMT):<br/>
I like the term Domain to represent all of the Agents and one endpoint controlled by an Identity.  I also include the constraint that all of the Agents are built by the same vendor and can have internal knowledge of one another that cannot be assumed about Agents in another Domain.  
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 18:41:33 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 18:47:08 GMT):<br/>
In practice, an Identity might use several Agent Vendors (one from Evernym, one from IBM, one from AgentsRUs) and those would be separate domains.   I think we would be safe (at least for V1) in assuming that even though they are linked to the same Identity (person, organization), they are separate domains and don't interact with each other - just with the Identity.
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 19:03:38 GMT):<br/>
Ok. This is great. Thank you. So, I'll summarize another way by saying that an Agency would create a Domain for an Identity Owner that would include all the Agents collaborating for an Identity Owner inside the Agency. An Agency can have multiple Domains (one for each Identity Owner), and a Domain can have multiple Agents (managed by the Domain of the Identity Owner inside the Agency). Agree?
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 19:05:22 GMT):<br/>
Would Domains inside an Agency share the same Domain Endpoint? (The Endpoint for every Domain inside an Agency would be under the same TDID.)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=rTsWQgnanpkAjrpby) @swcurran I've thought a little differently than this. In this line of thinking are you assuming that a pairwise DID could involve multiple domains? For example could I have half of my agents through one vendor and half through another vendor which would mean I have two domains? Even though I have control/influence over agents from two vendors for 1 pairwise relationship?

Would it be the same if only agents in my domains know the endpoints in another one of my domains? E.g. 1@K is my Evernym Agency Agent, 2@K is my Evernym Cloud Agent, 3@K is my phone running connect.me, 4@K is my IBM Watson agent, , and 1@A is Alice's Agency Agent. I want a message to go 1@A -> 1@K -> 2@K -> 3@K -> 4@K -> 3@K -> 2@K -> 1@K -> 1@A with processing happening at each step of the way. I don't think this is something we are going to assume is a first implementation use case, but if we're going to consider it as a future upgrade, I want to understand the language we'll use to describe it in order to prevent us from muddying the language to describe moving messages between our Agency Domains.

@kdenhartog - while in theory I could create a pairwise DID that references multiple domains, I think that is an unnecessary complication and can be left out of V1 of the protocol without loss. If we later find it is needed, it can be added.

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 20:53:02 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran I just realized I was adding that as an edit rather than a separate message. Does this make sense why I want to define it?

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 20:54:47 GMT):<br/>
I propose that we refer to this as idea with multiple domains as a Sovereign Domain, where as all agents within 1 agency are just a domain.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 20:57:05 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog - I don't believe the first messaging protocol should only support peer-to-peer app level messaging (in terms I used last) week, with the possible (but not necessary) exception of a message sent in parallel to multiple peers (one to many).  We should not support a message intended to be processed in a serial manner as described above.  That's just way too complex.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 20:57:52 GMT):<br/>
If you are talking about it just from routing (instead of "processing"), I'm back to the sender should not need to know how to route the message all the way to the recipient - just to the next agent to move it along.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=qPCurcQ2v4couehaz) @swcurran I thought the reason we we're handling routing of messages in the way we were is so that a domain can chose to handle complexity of this level both at the processing level and at the routing level?

The application message could define that it needs to understand where the processing is handled (e.g. part of the data is signed by 1 agent and the other part is signed by another agent) but that is defined at the application level, so we don't need to consider it as long as it's not prevented which you're routing proposal suggests is fine because the only time sovereign domains interact is through their agencies.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 21:11:35 GMT):<br/>
So in the proposal I put forward, there is no support for that.  One Agent is sending a message to One Agent.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=DJAkuN3s6S947uX3j) @swcurran genomic data processing which is offloaded to a cloud agent (e.g. IBM watson) but is considered acceptable by the edge agent e.g. the phone so it also signs the message to give strong authorization that the data has not been made up/ the IBM watson agent isn't impersonating the identity owner and making false genomic data.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 21:17:24 GMT):<br/>
My quick answer is: Verifiable Credentials for delegation/approval and multiple messages to accomplish the transaction.  Not a single message, but an App Layer series of messages.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 21:18:20 GMT):<br/>
It wouldn't be a must have case at the moment, but it's an example of the complexity of messages that we might have to handle at the routing layer. Another example is the signing via multiple devices to authorize a large money transfer. It's up to the two identity owners to decide what they want to be able to do (at the application layer). FWIW, I don't believe we are disabling this use case in my eye. I just am wanting to understand the language to know how we describe a message that may flow through multiple vendors.

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 21:26:58 GMT):<br/>
If we assume that an application can handle messaging in this way though, we'll need a way to describe a domain which allows a message to travel through multiple vendors. A less complex example would be if I use an Evernym Agency agent and a CLI agent. Would this still be classified as a single domain even though the agents are produced by two separate vendors (Evernym and Hyperledger)

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 21:30:13 GMT):<br/>
The problem is that to handle an arbitrary message addressed to multiple parties for arbitrary processing makes the routing WAY more complex. If you leave it to the App Layer above - the routing is easy - one to one every time.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 21:31:01 GMT):<br/>
Multiplex might be an exception (the identical message sent to multiple Agents for processing) might be an exception, but I think it is super complex.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 21:38:45 GMT):<br/>
I don't understand how this adds additional complexity. Say for example I have an app message that has this format 
{ "type": "payment", 
"amount": 10,000, 
"Signatures" : ["DID#key1" : signature1, 
                         "DID#key2" : signature2 ] } 
Agent 1 formats the message then authcrypts it then puts it in a forward message format and anon crypts it and sends it to agent 2's endpoint who anondecrypt's realizes the message is for it, then authdeccrypts the message and appends it's signature to the signatures array reencrypts it all back up and routes it to the agency which then sends it across. Processing 2 messages for this type of use case I would argue is more complex because I have to associate the two messages and hold them in storage until I have both and then process them together rather than letting the routing handle it and the application package it all properly. In this case, the person who is verifying payment has all the data in a single message which is less complex.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 21:42:00 GMT):<br/>
Point of the use case though is that the application should be able to decide routing flows as well as messaging structures and by allowing for both types we're allowing a more enriching application layer.

A good application layer family will need to account many different sovereign domain structures. If it accounts for only specific setups, then many users won't be able to support it.

I think this more or less drops right into the outline that @swcurran is using, and that it is pretty distinct from an agency.

<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 22:03:57 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman @swcurran I’m reading the Sovrin Protocol repository and documentation in preparation for the 2 day vConference. I came across this paragraph, and I was confused:
>Because Relationships and Attributes are orthogonal, an Issuer does not issue credentials to a particular DID. Remember DIDs are contextual to a relationship, and Credentials should be usable in different relationships without sharing correlation handles across relationships or contexts.
https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/protocol#the-relationship-attribute-plane

Doesn’t the Issuer need to establish a connection and issue the credential to the pairwise DID of that connection? But, because of the “link secret”, a credential holder can fulfill proof requests with a proof derived from any credential issued to any pairwise DID. Is that correct?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 22:17:10 GMT):<br/>
My understanding:

Technically, no. The Issuer must have a Schema and a CredDef.  In the CredRequest, the Holder must say what Credential they want and their Blinded Link Secret. The Holder can then receive the Credential.

How the request/issue data is delivered is not relevant to the actual credential contents. So, for example, if the Issuer and Holder are in person, no DID-based connection is necessary.  We've actually got an implementation of an off-line Proof Request/Proof sequence that does not require any pairwise DID-relationship.

To put it another way - no part of the pairwise DID relationship data between the issuer and holder goes into the Credential. The pairwise relationship is established to allow various messages to go back and forth to, for example, enable the issuer to know how they know the holder - e.g. "Ah...this is Student 39859309 and we have some data about her".
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 22:21:35 GMT):<br/>
Excellent. Thanks @swcurran . So, how the credential is delivered (most commonly would be through a pairwise DID connection) is independent of how the credential is created and how proofs are created from credentials.
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 22:26:33 GMT):<br/>
Another statement clarification:
> Each DID/Agent combination requires a separate key. An endpoint must be unique per relationship, so an agent must support multiple endpoints.
https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/protocol#the-relationship-agent-plane

Has this changed since the Transport (D)ID discussion?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 22:27:03 GMT):<br/>
100% on the latter (proofs from credentials - we've done it) and I'm pretty well certain the same is true for credential creation.

BTW - we think that in-person verification could be a really good thin edge use case - bars, events where you have to show your drivers license, etc.  No pairwise DIDs needed - just take the credential you have from the Driver's Licence issuer, prep a selective disclosure proof request, create the proof, and deliver it for verification.
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 22:28:17 GMT):<br/>
Very intriguing use case. :)
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 22:34:40 GMT):<br/>
Here is current thinking on that.  

Across domains - wire encryption/no plaintext is necessary, so key/endpoint is needed. However, that is pulled from the destination DID, so all good.  Daniel and I are debating whether the routing data for a shared Domain Endpoint should be minimized, which if it does would require a second layer of routing encryption.

Within a domain - it's totally up to the implementation. They may or may not need to encrypt all plaintext between nodes.

As such, we don't have to talk about TDIDs anymore from an interoperability perspective. They are internal to a Domain and may or may not be needed.

I'm planning to remove references to them from the HIPE.

@dbluhm @mhailstone That's a different goal from what is proposed in the Agenda - and would seem to be less aggressive and not focused on delivering code.  Not against it, but it's not what I hope to get out of it.  I think the HIPE documents can get in the way of the discussion. Preference would be to an easier mechanism for the early discussion and then into HIPEs.  Again - not against the HIPE process when the topic is ready, but if you go too early, I think it's much harder to make progress, just because of the use of github.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 17:36:53 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran I think what you are saying is true of whats been happening so far with HIPEs. Too much talk and too little implementation and tests to back up the proposal. In the future, starting as soon as possible, we would like tests to accompany HIPEs that have reached an approproate level of discussion.

I agree that many of the HIPEs are intended to that end, but we wanted to create an agenda of topics to discuss and prioritize for the Agent Summit. If the lead person wants to incorporate a related/specific HIPE in summarizing the topic, I think that would be fine, but the agenda should be focused on what the group feels are the most important topics to achieve the interoperability goal. I think initially going through the HIPEs as an approach would deter from the goal and purpose of the summit. I'm not against discussing the HIPEs, just the approach to finish them first as the prioritized agenda.

<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 17:41:36 GMT):<br/>
I'll call @nage in for his opinion, as it was his suggestion
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 17:47:31 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm I have commentary on the Type HIPE. What's the best way to do that? Comments on the pull request, or an additional pull request of some type?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 17:50:18 GMT):<br/>
Both have been done.  Comments have been added, and Daniel did a pull request against my fork to just make changes.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 17:51:08 GMT):<br/>
so which is the cannonical HIPE at this point? @dbluhm's, or yours?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 17:52:31 GMT):<br/>
They are different HIPEs, different purposes.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 17:56:08 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam I think it depends on the extent of your coments/changes. If it's a substantial rewrite of a section of the HIPE, a PR seems better. If not, i think a comment would be fine.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 17:56:52 GMT):<br/>
I've started it as a comment. If you think it needs to be a pull request, I'll do that work.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 17:57:12 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran copy that. I was confused about what you meant.

</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 17:58:26 GMT):<br/>
If you've already started the comment, it's probably not worth it to make it a PR. Whatever is easier
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 18:13:19 GMT):<br/>

@mhailstone @swcurran 
> the current intended goal of the Agent Summit is to focus on getting implementation details flushed out for an interoperable Agent protocol

So it's unclear to me exactly what form the product of this goal will take. What did you have in mind?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 18:24:33 GMT):<br/>
M thought is several levels:

Minimum: a whiteboard design/agreement with a commitment to write up the solution
Medium: a Google Doc of the design for sharing and comment collection/agreement
Ideal: A HIPE that covers the topic.

My feeling is that a HIPE is not realistic and will take away from the discussion time.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 18:41:18 GMT):<br/>
Figuring out what should be in the HIPE (and likely commit someone there to write said HIPE) I think is the right goal.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 18:48:30 GMT):<br/>
@mhailstone do you have the Agent Summit event details somewhere that I could easily share it? Is the agenda google doc the best thing to share?
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 20:05:48 GMT):<br/>
The suggestion in last Friday's Agent call was to have some kind of an artifact or document written up, similar to how Rebooting Web of Trust conferences work. Like @swcurran said, the minimum goal would be to have a agreement and commitment for a solution on a topic. Having Google documents and HIPEs would be a nice target, but may not be done at the summit. Having an assignment to have those written after the summit would be part of the minimum I think as well.

@mhailstone the idea there was to corral active items and make sure we had the right action items elsewhere on the agenda (or work item commitments), not to handle each HIPE there in the meeting.  It is a common tactic and W3C meetings to try and make sure f2f time is getting used up on the most pressing issues and not see ending on things that are already moving forward using the asynchronous HIPE process.

Hello, Guys.
I am reading some doc to try to figure out how to setup a fresh Indy network. One more thing, in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/05868745e44634398b56032051e8a516d8621080/doc/getting-started/getting-started.md, the steward use `steward_did_info = {'seed': '000000000000000000000000Steward1'}` to create a did, and then it can signannsubmit the transaction, like this: `nym_request = await ledger.build_nym_request(steward_did, steward_faber_did, steward_faber_key, None, role)
await ledger.sign_and_submit_request(pool_handle, steward_wallet, steward_did, nym_request)`. That because there is Steward Agent on the ledger and its NYM DID generated from seed 000000000000000000000000Steward1, right? And then any DID generated from this seed, will be treat as this Steward Agent, is that correct?

Hey folks, I did a major rewrite of the Transport Messaging HIPE to address feedback from the community, and update the Slides presentation I did to reflect the changes.  The major changes:

* Eliminated discussion of "within domain" requirements - since those are implementation specific. For example, we should not require encryption when routing a message from agent to agent within a domain.  That narrowed the scope of the HIPE and allowed elimination of weird terms like TDIDs.
* Documented a way to reduce the routing information made available to the shared Domain Endpoint (aka the Agency Endpoint), and correspondingly added an identity-specific "Cloud Routing Agent" that has all of the routing available.
   * The reduction creates additional complexity - another layer of encryption from Sender to Cloud Routing Agent, and made the minimum DIDDoc an endpoint + 3 keys vs. previous endpoint + 2 keys.
* Added a sample DIDDoc to show the contents of a DIDDoc that matches DID Spec requirements.

Revised Slides presentation: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1f8m9_g87oGie2jgU1Gb3F6HuxG0rgCAzQGANs8z3a_Q

Hi, im working with the indy agent node js implementation. When alice accepts a credential from acme, for example, acme will then call exports.request within indy/src/credentials/handlers.js which will then call exports.acceptRequest within indy/src/credentials/index.js and it is here the values are set for the credential.

I am looking to know how exports.request within indy/src/credentials/handlers.js is actually called, as I am trying to create an agent where the issuer can then manually enter in values for the credential. 

Just struggling at the moment to fully understand the data flow and functionality and understanding this aspect would be beneficial. Any help would be much appreciated.

@swcurran thinking about your updated doc. Now, making a pairwise identifier really means making a whole collection of keys in a distributed fashion.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 26 Jul 2018 16:47:30 GMT):<br/>
it isn't just "I make a key, you make a key", but you make a set of keys, and I make a set of keys...."
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 26 Jul 2018 17:22:40 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that's how I interpret where we have arrived in the discussion.  I hope that is right.  

I can see another way to go - there is one agent handling the conversation/decryption, and then it figures out who will handle the message.  In that model - the sender only ever sees one "device" - and we're back to one key.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=6RoX4mZ5zgxNawLX3) @DoctorX Technically, the seed is a seed for the *key* owned by the DID, not a seed for the DID itself. However, I believe the DID (which could be any random value) is derived deterministically from the key for convenience, so as a happy accident, the seed also governs the DID value as well. So: as long as you use the same seed, you will populate the wallet with the same DID+key, and will be able to act as that party in the future.

@swcurran it could be a forward, or it could be a 'redirect' authorized by main agent. That starts to feel a little like a relationship ledger, though perhaps not.

Hi, I recently heard about indy-agent, and I'm trying to get a high-level overview understanding of what it does, and how it compares to indy-sdk.
I suppose my first question would be: Does indy-agent enforce the use of the sovrin network specifically, or is it general-purpose?
If it's general purpose, does it require a blockchain? If so, would it work with any blockchain (are there specific requirements for the blockchain), and if not, would it be technically be usable with something different (eg. a trusted database).

@nage and @kdenhartog : I've been thinking more deeply about the correlation risk that you described earlier today, and it is becoming somewhat more concerning to me now that it felt to me at first. I hope we have a chance to explore in more detail tomorrow.

@danielhardman - did you go over the document in detail on the call today?  Or put another way - I've got a presentation for tomorrow for the Agent Call.  Is it worth doing or was the detail deep enough today?
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:47:18 GMT):<br/>
Is the agent call 7am Mountain or Pacific?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 19:55:45 GMT):<br/>
7am Pacific.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:00:11 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=5bGntyCYAoLRRSGzr) @swcurran I didn't go over the doc in detail. I spent about 2 min saying things like "We found some tickets that we needed to write, and others that we needed to prioritize higher; see my doc for more details." So a deeper dive may be profitable. (I will be at a funeral tomorrow, BTW, so will miss the meeting...)
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:00:52 GMT):<br/>
Reviewing the doc may be profitable for another reason, as well: my notes may not be a complete or an accurate capture. It would be good for others who attended the summit to check that.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:14:35 GMT):<br/>
OK - I'll keep going.  I'm collating mine, Matthew's and I'll include yours in the summary.  We can use the presentation to drive discussion as always.  This is not a group of passive listeners :-).  Updates to the presentation can be made as we go.

<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 20:27:39 GMT):<br/>
@mhailstone says 7am Mountain in the message above
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 21:32:48 GMT):<br/>
Arrggh...OK. I guess we'll have to go with 7AM Mountain time since this has gone out on multiple channels.  Matthew is away, so not even sure we can change the time - we're using his Zoom channel.
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 21:34:08 GMT):<br/>
Hmm .. better connect with @Sean_Bohan since he sent a message on https://sovrin.slack.com/archives/C1BMH6FGD/p1533242637000190 with 7am Pacific
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 21:34:15 GMT):<br/>
I'm just the messenger 
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 21:35:06 GMT):<br/>
looks like an open zoom room .. I just connected to it
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 21:35:32 GMT):<br/>
and normal time is 7am pacific .. 
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 21:35:38 GMT):<br/>
so maybe he just made a typo?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 21:41:12 GMT):<br/>
*Folks *- there was a typo in the message above from Matthew about tomorrow's agent call.  The call tomorrow is at 7AM Pacific, 8AM Mountain and so on.  That is - the call time is the same time as it has been for all the calls.

Best answer is to use docker - don't build things natively :-).  Doesn't help with this error, but will be a huge help going forward.

I didn't want to keep anyone any longer on the call but I had a couple of thoughts I wanted to propose to those looking to use the agent test suite. As I understand things, it seems like we need some way to trigger actions from the agent test suite in the agent being tested. As an example, in establishing a connection, we want to verify that the tested agent can initiate as well as reciprocate in that process. My first thought was to implement this as another module and message family that was used only for testing. @swcurran @saholman @TelegramSam

@dbluhm - I'd like to go through the Agent Test Suite and perhaps have some discussions and google docs spec'ing on how to keep building this before we do HIPEs.  I think we need the big picture first and I don't have it yet.  I'd like to maybe have a call or two next week to discuss this with you.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=Gp2maJBq4Jjjnc8ke) @json 10 If your running on windows, I think @swcurran is right.  Things are going to be a lot simpler using docker.  If you aren't familiar with docker or you really want to run it natively, just install docker and run `docker run -it -p 3000:3000 ubuntu` and then follow the getting started guide inside the ubuntu container.

I didn't get time to work on agent stuff today as would have been desirable. However, I wanted to share a spreadsheet that I worked up, that analyzes connections as a state machine. This has bearing on the HIPE from @RyanWest (PR #18). I think it is largely compatible with his vision, but there are some subtleties worth discussing. Specifically: I have eliminated the ACK and ACK ACK. This is because I think any messages that flow after the connection is made accomplish the same purpose, without us allocating a special message type and special message send for them (e.g., if I immediately sent a proof request after establishing a connection, the same knowledge would be gained). Also, I think the ACKs tell us less than we'd suppose, since any connection can decay as soon as a message is sent. Also, I'm assuming the notion of negotiation back-and-forth (request and offer and request and offer...) until both parties are satisfied, even though I don't imagine most connections will negotiate much. And I'm accepting the reality that each party may have a different view of the connection's state, so I'm only trying to model the view on one side.

Maybe we can discuss in next week's agent meeting, or I can record a 10-min video where I walk through my thinking...

I've update the Transport Protocol HIPE per discussions from last week. @TelegramSam I included in that the text from the JOSE header google doc above.  The HIPE covers three things - Wire Messages, the Routing message type "Forward" and the assumptions that a domain will make about another domain (e.g. existence and use of shared, untrusted Domain Endpoint and Routing Agent).

Changes are here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/21/commits/35c9a8fda2011763d85df2a57bccc67bcdc28760

I've reworked it to where we have arrived, but it's still (IMHO) too long, as it is explaining a lot.  It might be necessary if it was cut down to just the facts.

@danielhardman I'm looking through your spreadsheet about connections and watching your accompanying video as well. Thanks for putting those together. You focused more on the transitions from one state to the next rather than what is transmitted with each step so I wanted to paraphrase what I interpreted and get your feedback to make sure I was on the same page:

Alice initiates a connection with Bob:
1. Alice sends an out of band invitation to Bob.

2. Bob accepts the invitation, proposing a DID and key to be used. (I'm not sure I understood this correctly but that is what I interpreted from your assumption: "The invitation phase ends when the initiating (inviting) party is contacted and is able to transmit a Connection Request that is A2A encrypted with the DID+key they propose to use.")

3. Alice sends a Connection Request to Bob using the information provided by Bob when he accepted the invitation.

4. Bob sends a "Connection Outcome" to Alice, notifying of acceptance or rejection. (Is anything else transmitted here?)

@dbluhm Thanks for taking the time to digest what I created. The way you've summarized it is very close to the way I think about it, but there is a slight difference related to how the invitation phase is managed.

The party that receives the invitation (Bob) may already have an agent and a bunch of sovrin-enabled capabilities, or may have nothing but a cell phone or email client. If the latter, then we need a way to supply the missing capabilities. This is the flow that I call "onboarding", and which I want to think about as being distinct from connection flow. Let's assume that if onboarding is needed, Bob can start from the invitation he receives, and go all the way to having an edge agent (app on his phone) plus a cloud agent at an agency, in what feels to him like a single step taking only a few seconds. Once this is done, Bob is now in the state of any other invited person in the ecosystem: he has an invitation, and he has Sovrin capabilities, but he has not allocated any resources or a DID+keys yet, to manage the relationship that will be built if he pursues the invitation.

</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 23:21:28 GMT):<br/>
So the invited party (Bob) needs to allow the inviter (Alice) to send him a Connection Request. He could do this by allocating a DID and keys himself, and sending Alice information about the DID he has allocated to receive her CR. But that would mean he's spending his own resources before he even hears what Alice proposes for this relationship.

What I imagined instead, in this particular incarnation of the state machine, is that Bob fetches Alice's CR from a URL she has designated in the invitation. Alice's CR contains her own DID+keys, and Bob can then either ignore the CR, or allocate a DID+keys and reply to Alice's CR over traditional A2A channels--either sending a connection outcome message ("I accept") or a Connection Offer that is a counter-offer ("You said you wanted to be friends forever and tell each other all our secrets. How about if we're just friends for 10 minutes, and you promise to delete all my data when we're done with this eBay transaction?"). Thus, the fact that Alice was able to deliver the CR (whether or not it passed over A2A channels) is the event that puts the relationship in the "negotiation" phase from Alice's perspective.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 23:29:10 GMT):<br/>
Either way, any negotiation messages and the final outcome message from the connection flow are passed over A2A channels.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 23:29:51 GMT):<br/>
We could imagine a different state machine, in which Bob always provides a DID+keys at the end of the invitation phase, and then Alice transmits A2A-style to Bob. This asks Bob to take more on faith.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 06 Aug 2018 23:30:44 GMT):<br/>
If we get lots of connection spam, I think it would be nice not to have to allocate a DID and keys before we see the other party's Connection Request and reject it.

I'm thinking about putting the following content into a new HIPE about a "direct response mode" where A2A can take advantage of HTTP request/response semantics. Wanted to get community reaction first... https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w08h7bOXC2U_IxnQRvEaeu3tPDKplujX5sXKPDchbGs/edit#

Just drawing some more connections, this sounds similar to the idea @kdenhartog brought up during the agent summit of introduction "deaddrops" or using an agency to store the connection request that can be found using a nonce. The nonce would then be part of the url sent in the invitation.

The word "outcome" is a specific kind of response that moves the interaction to a terminal state. Also, consider other flows like credential issuance and proof presentation. The final message in these sequences is a "credential" or a "proof", not a "credential response" or a "proof response". So I am using "outcome" as a category of messages that may have 2 members of the category: a "Connection Acceptance" message and a "Connection Rejection" message. Both are connection outcomes. Both are responses. But I like calling them outcomes as opposed to generic responses.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 17:53:44 GMT):<br/>
(It could also be possible that acceptance and rejection are both expressed with a single message type. The name for such a message type would be "Connection Outcome", probably. I don't care which we do. I'm just using outcome in its generic sense here, not making a strong claim about what to call specific JSON structures.

@danielhardman Super good thinking. I'm thinking now about which of these error types are low hanging fruit, and if errors are a message family of their own (leaning this way) or should be defined within a family. 
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 21:24:47 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman this is getting down into the details again but I'm thinking about negotiation about the connection between Alice and Bob. Say we're to the point where Bob has received Alice's Connection Request. My first assumption that may need to be corrected is that Alice doesn't yet know how to communicate with bob over A2A encryption and routing. That then implies that Bob needs to transmit the pieces of information Alice needs as part of his connection counteroffer. Are we on the same page?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 21:29:06 GMT):<br/>
Would Bob then go ahead and generate a DID and key pair for the relationship so that Alice can then communicate back to Bob? (this seems to mean that Bob essentially accepts the connection which doesn't seem right...) Or would the messages exchanged to negotiate the connection be held on temporary communication channels? Or is everything just in plain text once it is off the wire?

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 07 Aug 2018 22:26:23 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm My assumption has been that the Connection Request must include information about where to respond to the inviter (Alice) in A2A fashion. If Bob is uninterested in connecting, he can ignore the CR and not allocate a DID. If, on the other hand, he has at least moderate interest in connecting, he has 2 choices. Both require him to allocate a DID+keys+endpoint and respond in A2A fashion with a message that communicates his side of the connection; one response is an acceptance, and the other is a counter offer.

@TelegramSam What I'd been thinking is that groups (e.g., Sovrin Foundation, HL, etc) could define/publish/maintain/curate a catalog of error codes. Imagine some list at a URL like http://sovrin.org/a2a-specs/error-codes that returns a doc like this (where each `code` is given a `friendly-text` and possibly has comments about what other fields of the message are used:

```unsupported-crypto: The sender used a crypto library that the receiver doesn't support. Supported encryption libraries are identified in the fix-hint message property.
wont-talk-to-anonymous: The sender used anon-encrypt, but the receiver's policy requires the sender to identify itself.
missing-message-in-thread: The receiver saw message N in a thread, but missed message N-1, N-2, etc. Some or all of the missing message numbers are enumerated in problem-items message property.
unrecognized-message-type: The message type that was received is not one that the receiver knows how to handle.```
... and so forth

There wouldn't be separate message types or message families for the `problem-report` messages--there'd just be that one type. Since almost all its message properties are optional, we could add new properties to it while remaining backward compatible. This would let us communicate about a very broad range of problems in a very flexible way, without lots of message types. The more I thought about errors, the less I liked the traditional approach where error messages are super tightly defined--because I think A2A interactions will rarely have the same coder/team on both sides of the interaction, so we need to maximize flexibility.

I don't know if my way of thinking is the ideal one, so I'm not arguing for it very hard. I'm just trying to describe it so we can discuss further.

I love the RSM for the establishment flow - very cool!

One thing that threw me off was the same person sending the invite and the connReq.  Shouldn't the State Machine have another state ("They answered invite") and another event (perhaps "InviteAccepted") to handle that?  Alice needs a trigger to send the connReq, as well as (I think) some information obtained from the trigger in order to send the connReq.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=PWgscQqNZi9zYy6dk) @danielhardman Wow...that's a lot of detail - all good and valid.  I am definitely just an observer here - I'm not hands on in dealing with this issue.

I have two opposing reactions to it.  On the one hand, when one is trying to sort out errors, all that information should be extremely useful.  On the other - it might be really hard to populate all of that information for each error that might occur.  Thus - helpful for the developer and painful for the developer. :-)

It's a given that we have to have a formal set of error codes - I'm thinking at minimum like HTTP - and since the A2A protocol is both async and at a much higher level than HTTP, by definition, the error handling will have to be more thorough.  Given the way we are defining message types (did;spec) and publishing specifications for them, I really like the idea of doing something similar here - as you have described.  Perhaps the error handling should be a message Family (Error) and a set of Error Types, with attributes based on the error (message) type?  That gives us a good way to define and specify arguments for each error.

Alternative - that each message family include a set of error message types that relate to the message family.  A HIPE like this would define the guidelines to use and perhaps some common errors, but the specific error message types would be built along side the family.

And of course the middle ground is more the decorator model.  A family of "core" error messages that all could use, and then leave it to each family to define and use additional message types specific to what the family has implemented.  The HIPE includes guidelines and an initial (and subsequently growing) list of core error messages, with guidelines on building out family-specific error messages.  In all cases, the "did;spec/" protocol MUST point to the published error message specification.

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 08 Aug 2018 16:56:37 GMT):<br/>
In my short experience pen testing, error codes revealed the most information about a system when I was first discovering the landscape of the system. This is something that can be used to correlate and reduce privacy. Generic codes that are vague about problems are actually very useful for preventing fingerprinting of the domain/agents. On the other hand, we definitely need valuable error codes to help developers resolve their problems. My suggestion is that we add some sort of tier system to the error codes depending on the trust level of the connection. As an example, an agent that's trying to setup an agent at the beginning will get error: connection failed and that's about it. Where as an agent that has a connection, but hasn't exchanged creds shouldn't be treated the same as an agent that has exchanged creds and established trust, or has maintained a persistent connection for a long time. In terms of what the criteria for these errors are I really haven't thought in depth about it yet. For an example of how errors are abused today, check this out: https://nilminus.wordpress.com/web-application-penetration-testing/information-gathering-2/testing-for-error-code/

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=6txLdfcu6RMyErTzt) This will be tricky to create the levels of tiers, these should definitely be in a standard message structure and we should be careful even when and if we update that error message structure and that it's done at the same time, same latency/timeout for all agents (as to not reveal how long it took which might indicate the size of your database, compute power, etc), etc.  I think a large part of this will be implementation prescription for agents as I see this exploit something someone could easily not think of when developing along with thoughtful considerations of the different tiers.  I don't have any solutions to offer, only agreeing, but I'll think about the tiered system.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=5EWsDEFqsR7TG6g2B) @swcurran This is a tough call and as well I'm just a mere observer, but to add to this I think the "helpful for the developer and painful for the developer" is dual-fold decision. 
 a) Given, as you mentioned, the much more thorough set of errors and verbosity of error codes that A2A will have to handle, and knowing even at the HTTP 1.1 level most developers consistently mess up or don't follow (because it's confusing and hard!) the RFC7231 spec for error handling (https://hackernoon.com/correct-error-handling-is-hard-307ea72759c7) I think expectations for guiding developer implementation or simply won't be followed or too confusing for someone just trying to make something. However, I completely see the other opposing reaction and populating the information problem... 
b) Going off of the _assumption_ that some developers won't use them correctly (based on HTML 1.1 historical problems), that gives way to the issues @kdenhartog brought up about correlation and fingerprinting that could be big attack vectors.
So in that case, I'm torn as well and think the middle ground or the first option your presented make more sense to me. However I'm merely speculating here and adding things that might be food for thought, as an observer.

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 08 Aug 2018 19:09:49 GMT):<br/>
What if we did something like a Debug error mode and a production error mode where if Debug mode is enabled very verbose errors are used, and production error mode keeps things to a minimum? This is definitely going to be a hard challenge to balance because I can see both sides as having valid reasons to support them. I'll keep thinking on this to see if I come up with any other ideas.

We're looking for a topic for the agent meeting on Friday.  I'm not able to lead the meeting, but will be there - I have to call from a place I can't talk a lot.

My thoughts:

* Connection Establishment - reviewing Daniel's spreadsheet and adding data - what are the messages, what might the (implementation specific) connection events look like?
* HIPE Status - any reorgs - particularly - what to do with transport HIPE (I'm going to send a proposal)

Other ideas?

All,

We are having a discussion about establishing connections:

Daniel Hardman - Viewing the Connection Establishment as a State Machine
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RLJhhlWCUBYpKn18S5BGi7HH9MfGiZdHBxKjsJavoMs/edit?usp=sharing
Note that there is a link in the spreadsheet to a video walkthrough of this that you might look at ahead of time. Focus can then be primarily on the flow (is it right?) and the data (what goes back and forth?).

@danielhardman after talking with @nage about negotiations during connection establishment, we ended up feeling that the type of key used in the relationship made the most sense as something to be negotiated during connection. Any other terms would be negotiated after establishing the connection. What are your thoughts on moving other negotiations (like the example you gave of negotiating the expiration of the connection) to a post-connection negotiation?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Mon, 13 Aug 2018 18:39:32 GMT):<br/>
I think this might help keep the connection protocol simple and make any negotiations held during connection establishment more directly related to the literal connection itself
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Mon, 13 Aug 2018 19:42:02 GMT):<br/>
plus if we do it post-connection we can leverage the credentials and messaging protocols for logging and evidence both parties agreed
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Mon, 13 Aug 2018 19:42:55 GMT):<br/>
so the TOFU connection is *the* connection request, and you're relationship could be in the "terms of connection not yet accepted" relative to your relationship state machine or willingness to leverage the connection.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Mon, 13 Aug 2018 19:43:21 GMT):<br/>
but we can hash that out after we get through the basics of microledgers and credentials exchange

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=k9MiESdCriZW7GniS) @dbluhm I agree that some of the examples of negotiation that I used are artificial. However, there is another issue that's ripe for negotiation, that must happen early (can't use @nage's TOFU preference, even though I also would prefer it otherwise). It's payment/cost. If a company is inviting someone to connect, and that someone doesn't want to incur any costs as part of the connection (they don't already have a cloud agent and don't want to pay to get one, just to facilitate this connection), then negotiating about whether the inviter would sponsor a cloud agent on behalf of the invitee needs to be possible. This can't be done after, because by the time we're "after", the cloud agent must already exist.

So my short answer is: sure, we can try to limit negotiation before. But so far I'm not feeling like we can build a connection protocol where all negotiation happens after.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 21:18:54 GMT):<br/>
interesting use case.  How would you propose that negotiation occur?  Would it be terms of service + tokens?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 22:20:04 GMT):<br/>
Hey Folks, I've broken the "Transport Layer" HIPE into three separate HIPEs

- Wire Messages - the protocol for handling sending Agent Messages across hops from one Agent to another on their journey to the Receiver
- Cross Domain Messaging - the "Forward" message type and the assumptions the Sender can make about the Agent configuration
- DIDDoc Conventions - conventions within a DIDDoc - notably, how to find the endpoint/key for the Domain Endpoint and the key of the Routing Agent.

The topics are intertwined, but the HIPEs can/should be broken into 3 separate PRs.  Since I didn't really know how to do that (although I can guess...) I thought I would just promote this for review for now and I can deal with the separate PRs as a follow on.

Please let me know what you think of the HIPEs - the content, and the process.

Thanks!

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=3dEfoSEHqdKiJGKzD) @danielhardman Would you consider negotiation during the "invitation" phase appropriate then? I'm considering "invitation" messages out-of-band of agent messages, so any kind of interaction/negotiation could happen during that time. When an invitation is accepted/negotiated, then according to the implementation of the invitation, one party would initiate the "connection request" message as an agent message as the first message of the connection flow.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 22:41:11 GMT):<br/>
@mhailstone and @nage: I'm not sure how to model this. It's messy. Maybe the simplest thing would be: the invitation can be treated as take-it-or-leave-it, and can include information about a free sponsorship offer. If any negotiation is necessary, the invitee accepts the sponsorship and fires up a cloud agent, whereupon the negotiation can happen over a connected channel. Possibly the negotiation causes the first cloud agent to be abandoned (treated as a temporary throwaway "burner" cloud agent), replaced with something more attractive to the invitee?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 23:20:48 GMT):<br/>
I think we should work hard to make the Agent creation process be as isolated as possible from the connection process.  I agree it is a possible byproduct and there is a need to allow both to happen, but the establish connection protocol should have as little knowledge of that process as possible. I don't think the messages should reference issues like that.

Last fall as Evernym was building the MVP version of VCX and its cloud agent, I did an analysis of knowledge is passed as each stage of a connection interaction is completed. At the time, the risk of changing course with our MVP product was too high to propose changes things but I think its insights could be useful now.
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jnnvnibFfk_X-YZC12NTsF10sMIwKnYMefJ4_VhGSLo/

The document is terse and don't say much about the setup. It uses snail mail as a metaphor. Bob and Alice exchange postcards.

@danielhardman Seems to me that in the use-case where on-boarding is required during a connection establishment with non-agency entity the process could flow like this:

First, connection is between the user being on-boarded and the agent provider (agency). That connection could be direct, edge agent to agency. 
Second, after connection is established, a negotiation about the service could happen. If successful, the cloud agent created and the edge agent could be configured to use it.
Third, the connection to entity that initiated the on-boarding could be establish. Using the edge agent and the newly form cloud agent.

I think the use of cloud agent negotiation will have to happen the first time I open my edge agent anyway. We can just put the origin connection process on hold till the agent usage negotiation process is complete.

Hi, i try to use the following code (copied from the indy-agent-stuff (part: "GOVID") and adapted it in my server implementation;
my server should be able to manage for several different users; the following code is functional on the first invocation; on the second one i get an ```AnoncredsCredDefAlreadyExistsError````
which i thought tht the lines between ```// OMIT AGAIN CREATION OF CREDENTIAL DEFINITION - BEGIN / END```; in order to proceed i just did the WORKAROUND; 
can somebody tell me what I do wrong?
```public async issueDebitCardCredential(indyClient: IndyClient): Promise<any> {
        // get account information from the user database
        let accountConfig = new Accounts().findByName(indyClient.username);

            throw new Error('No AccountConfig found for ' + indyClient.username);
        }
        // get debitcard information for usage in the credential
        let debitcard = accountConfig.credentials.debitcard;
        if (!debitcard) {
            throw new Error('No debitcard information found for ' + indyClient.username);
        }

Hi, i try to use the following code (copied from the indy-agent-stuff (part: "GOVID") and adapted it in my server implementation;
my server should be able to manage for several different users; the following code is functional on the first invocation; on the second one i get an ```AnoncredsCredDefAlreadyExistsError```which i thought that the lines between ```OMIT AGAIN CREATION OF CREDENTIAL DEFINITION - BEGIN / END``` is the place to circumvent that; in order to proceed i just did the WORKAROUND;

@ThomasKrech You only need to call `sdk.issuerCreateSchema` and `sdk.issuerCreateAndStoreCredentialDef` only once. This is when the agency becomes an issuer of credentials for this definition. Ideally, these calls would be followed by writing them on the ledger. To issue an offer/credential to a user subsequently, you just need to call `sdk.issuerCreateCredentialOffer` and `sdk.issuerCreateCredential` for each user.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 13:38:28 GMT):<br/>
You need to save the credentialDefinitionId created the first time, and pass it later in the offer and credential calls

Hi, i try to use the following code (copied from the indy-agent-stuff (part: "GOVID") and adapted it in my server implementation;
my server should be able to manage several different users; the following code is functional on the first invocation; on the second one i get an `AnoncredsCredDefAlreadyExistsError` which i thought that the lines between `OMIT AGAIN CREATION OF CREDENTIAL DEFINITION - BEGIN / END` is the place to circumvent that; in order to proceed i just did the WORKAROUND;

I think it would be really helpful if the protocol around the Relationship State Machine and specifically the operations that update the DIDDoc elements was outlined.  How does domain replicate an update to the attributes of a DID to the other instances of the RSM - either on the Public Ledger or to the other instance(s) of the DID on microledgers?  This work would include defining how a DID on the public ledger would support all of the attributes defined in the DID Spec.

Question for @danielhardman, @devin-fisher and perhaps @esplinr - how much of that code and/or documentation already exists that should be used as a starting place, or should someone just start to build up a HIPE from scratch?    And...if that documentation exists, can we begin to turn it into a concrete HIPE such that interoperable implementations are possible?

 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 22:35:58 GMT):<br/>
I think this is somewhat (but not crucially) related to the Connection Establishment discussion. Since the Connection Establishment includes setting up the initial instance of the DIDDoc attributes, I think we should assume that as part of that, the Identities will be delivering as much or as little of the DiDDoc attributes as necessary.

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 22:56:54 GMT):<br/>

Ah good stuff - I'll take a look.  Now I recall seeing that.  Seeing the code link was cool - but it's to a fork of the entire Indy-SDK. I'll have to look harder to find the code related to the RSM.  Homework time!!

At our recent A2A summit, I presented the idea of a message that is just a bundle of other messages, and suggested that this might be desirable. There was some pushback along the lines of, “Batches might be a nice optimization, but we don’t need it right now. Just send the messages one at a time.”

I don’t actually disagree with the timing observation. We’ve got plenty of other things on our plates right now, so I’m happy to worry about this later. But I wanted to see if I could make a case for bundling that’s a little stronger than just, “this is an optimization we can get around to whenever.” Hopefully you’ll agree with me enough to adopt this concept when we need it.

Its mostly ideas and diagrams right now, but we will keep you updated.  Basically we are just trying to build a new reference agent that follows the model discussed at the agent summit.  I think the best thing we all can do right now is to try to build our own agent and update the test suite as we do so.

@swcurran and @mhailstone Apparently the comment that I made in today's call about private individuals not being allowed to write DIDs to the public ledger is no longer accurate. Lawyers and BOT people at the SF analyzed the risk and discussed at a recent Trust Framework meeting. They concluded that, although there is some legal uncertainty, the risk to Sovrin's legality is low enough that this proscription is not needed.

Frankly the idea and an IP address is "personal data" is very misguided as well. Yes the way many providers implement their networks does reveal locations and so forth but the technology itself doesn't have to be that way. I wonder if there is any legal case that has set that precedent?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=WAQex3vptp7qEniBg) @jljordan_bcgov I would agree with that notion as well. A dynamically assigned IP address could be associated with multiple individuals at different times and over a longer period of time wouldn't be deterministic toward an individual. Data over the wire sent to the IP address would be identifiable/correlatable, though (if you have access to it). Static IP addresses are reusable as well, but are more correlatable.

I've cancelled the PR for the HIPE that I originally entered about Transport Messaging Protocol and created three new PRs for the HIPEs that spun out of that effort - one on Wire Messages, one on Cross Domain Messaging, and a last one on DIDDoc Conventions.

Would like feedback on all three, and particularly from @peacekeeper on the DIDDoc one (alignment with DID Spec) and @kdenhartog and @TelegramSam on the Wire Messages one.

I've not yet updated the Wire Messages one after the discussion this morning but will do so.

Hi Guys, I’m new to the chat and trying to get up to speed with the latest progressions in the indy-agent WG. I had a couple of questions/clarifications around the connection flow posted above.
1.	Is the “one time encryption key” in the root object of the Bob --> Alice: request, the connection key, just not renamed?
2.	With the current Bob --> Alice: request, does the agent see the inner message type? If so I heard it briefly discussed on the latest indy call that this visibility to the cloud agent might want to be preserved to allow auto cloud agent message policies in future. Does this mean the standard messaging structure will mean all message types are disclosed to the cloud agent always or does this only stand for the connection message family?

</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 14:54:04 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=FJmiySGqrzGtAwMNG) @tlooker The "one time encryption key" is not the same as the key created with the pairwise DID in the connection, but literally a one time use key to encrypt the data and to help identify who the entity is from/to. For the second point (and others please chime in if opinions differ), if you forward a message, then you can hide the message type from the agent and the intended agent would only see the message type. It is up to the sender whether they want to disclose the message type to the agency/routing agent or not. @swcurran @saholman am I getting that right?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 15:54:04 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran there's a few things that I need to do a PR against your wire protocol HIPE to ask some questions about a few things. Expect a PR by Wednesday.

</p>
<p><strong>tlooker</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 20:21:42 GMT):<br/>
@mhailstone Great thanks for the clarification, just to understand further though, the connection key apart of the connection invitation/offer from Alice is the same as the key shown on line 16 in the UML above isn't it, as it is the connection key (one time use)? Furthermore are we envisaging that Alice's edge agent at the generates connection invitation/offer phase, sends another message not represented here, to her cloud agent registering the connection key, so that when the cloud agent receives the connection request from Bobs agent, it knows based on the connection key to forward the message to Alices, edge agent?
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 20:26:06 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=P3fkucyTxfZNWhR6E) @tlooker You are right that the "one time use" key is used in the cloud agent (or whatever tiered agent infrastructure exists in the agency) in forwarding the message to the edge agent. The implementation of the invitation would need to configure or otherwise let the cloud/routing agents know about the key and which edge agent the key is associated with.
</p>
<p><strong>tlooker</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 20:34:10 GMT):<br/>
@mhailstone Thanks, also do you know if anyone has done / is doing a review on libvcx as it appears this library has a bit of overlap with the spec developing in this WG, from my understanding libvcx is currently tethered to evernym's closed source agent, but if the library was modified it could be a good base line library for edge agents?
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 20:38:23 GMT):<br/>
Agreed. As I understand it, the libvcx merge into the sdk should help provide a more smooth agent development experience. You're probably already aware, but for reference, the libvcx HIPE is here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/29. @esplinr should be able to answer questions regarding libvcx.

Can you point me to a step by step description (possibly with graphs) of a workflow for the verification of a claim e.g. during a login. I am interested to know how a client contacts his agent, then how its agent finds out how to contact the target DIDs agent and how they communicate.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=xxNTb7kSKt4xxLDKr) @baconsandwich I don't have such docs handy (though i believe they exist). However, let me offer this much, quickly: the client-to-agent part is up to implementers. One client might contact its agent over a raw socket; another might do so over https; etc. The agent-contacting-agent part happens when a DID is looked up on the ledger, retrieving a DID Document that proves which keys are associated with the DID and that provides a URL at which the DID's agent may be contacted. You may find the following resources helpful: the README.md files in PRs 35, 36, and 37 in the indy-hipe repo (github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe). You may also want to learn about the function in indy-sdk called indy_build_get_ddo_request (see https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/3647740238ddf17dbf1104df26f547977ce3244f/libindy/src/api/ledger.rs#L313), which builds a request to the indy ledger asking for a remote party's DID Doc. (You can then submit the request with indy_send_request()).

@swcurran and @mhailstone and @kdenhartog and @MALodder and others working on A2A HIPEs: one detail that we need to think about is timing as it relates to usage of keys. If Alice sends a message to Bob at time 1, rotates her key at time 2, and then Bob receives the message at time 3, Bob may deem the message illegitimate if he simply looks up Alice's DID Doc at the time the message was received. What he ideally wants is to look up the DID Doc at the time when Alice claims to have sent the message. This is perfectly possible in Indy. Problem is, an Alice impersonator can get one of Alice's old keys and claim she sent a message back when that key was valid. Does the double ratchet provided by Signal solve this?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=ws5zqZkbp9M5uHgDx) @danielhardman One thing to remember is that if the data is on a microledger, there will be an Agent Message sent to notify Bob that the key was rotated. That will reduce (but perhaps not eliminate) the likelihood. Since message ordering is not guaranteed so there could still be an issue.  Does that reduce the it enough for now?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 16:12:38 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I think it reduces the risk of Alice impersonators enough, for now, that I don't feel need for immediate additional protections. But I don't think it eliminates it. In the long run, we need an answer.

Regardless, I still think we may need a way to make a claim about when a message was sent, so the receiver knows which version of a DID Doc to test the key against.

<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 20:47:03 GMT):<br/>
@mhailstone I'm a bit out of the loop (travelling) but as I was reviewing your PR against the connection HIPE, I noticed that no mention of connection offers (in terms of negotiation) was made. Was this deliberately omitted for now?
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 20:53:48 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm Yes. From our discussion on Friday Aug. 17, the group agreed that the invitation phase proposed by @danielhardman would be adopted in place of an offer message in the connection flow.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 21:19:51 GMT):<br/>
I'm on the same page there but we had discussed the connection offer message being used as a counter offer message for negotiations.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 21:21:13 GMT):<br/>
Have we punted negotiations during connection establishment until later?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 24 Aug 2018 00:23:45 GMT):<br/>
I think we decided that negotiation during connections is a bit esoteric. There might be a case for them, but it wouldn't be mainstream; the only scenario that we unambiguously believed in was Nathan's about negotiating a type of crypto for compatibility. So we kind of decided to ignore that issue for now.

Since you are referring to PRs in HIPE, does that mean that no agent-to-agent communication is implemented atm? The thing is, that I was looking at the [transaction documentation](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/transactions.md#nym) and could find anything related to a URL of a DID's agent. Or this stored in a ATTRIB transaction? Again, my question is basically: How do I find the agent for a DID?

@baconsandwich - A2A Communication does work and has been done multiple times but different groups. The point of the HIPEs is to define common ways to build them so Agents built by the different groups are interoperable.  That is a work in progress.

As to your question about the URL - yes, for now it goes into an ATTRIB.  That is an area for interoperability - improving Indy-Node to use mechanisms that explicitly align with the DID Spec vs. conventions in the use of ATTRIB name/value pairs.

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 01:43:18 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran, I was thinking about how A2A would work over some different protocols besides http -- specifically, SMTP and BlueTooth. I don't think we have to know in great detail right now, but I think it's a good mental exercise to ask the question. The role played by 9 in your current cross-domain HIPE is played by an SMTP server in email; it's not clear to me what happens in BlueTooth.

Anyway, I don't think it undermines anything we've been talking about, but perhaps it makes the context of our own mental explorations a bit clearer. I wonder if perhaps we should consider renaming your HIPE: "Cross-Domain Messaging for Cloud" (cloud, I think, being the defining characteristic of how we're using 9 and 8). That way if we described Cross-Domain Messaging for BlueTooth or for SMTP or for <whatever>, it would make more sense.

But this is just me thinking aloud. Don't take it too seriously; maybe just let it simmer for a while...

@danielhardman - great thought. It would be really good if someone with experience in those mechanisms.  I think these would be additional HIPEs as I agree, it doesn't change the "across the 'Net" nature of what we have now.

I've thought a bit about Bluetooth for the in-person verification for unconnected Identities - think a Waiter/Bartender. Connected identities could also use the connection.  The biggest challenge I see is how much of a disaster Bluetooth is to deal with, but perhaps that gets abstracted away.

Wow...hadn't at all thought of SMTP.  That's an interesting one.

Fine to change the name of the HIPE - that is reasonable.

<p><strong>VitalijReicherdt</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 14:12:07 GMT):<br/>
in the reference implementation, we have 1 client wallet per agent... in this case is an endpoint with IP:PORT enough for P2P between 2 wallets.
If i have more wallets per agent, is endpoint not enough for P2P, because the message is encoded i need the right wallet for decode the message...
How is this problem to solve with standard sdk? I can put the additional params (wallet name or so) in http body, but this is not really a good solution in my opinion.

I wanted to update everyone that the https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent repository has merged some pull requests. Many thanks to those submitting pull requests! Particularly, @ArthurManz provided a great update using docker and an upgrade to indy-sdk 1.6.1. I recommend that you take a look at the new changes in the repository. We hope to incorporate the decisions represented in the HIPEs after they are officially accepted and encourage those interested to help out in contributing to those solutions for all/new languages in the reference implementation.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=sCxcyPEnvA7AmoXRC) @VitalijReicherdt Even though the SDK supports multiple wallets, we have made the assumption that each agent only has one wallet.  One wallet should be sufficient to manage multiple connections, DIDs, credentials, etc.  What is your use case for multiple wallets?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 15:39:12 GMT):<br/>
@VitalijReicherdt agreed that the limit of IP:PORT as an endpoint in a DID is insufficient.  This is expected to be changed in Indy-SDK so that you can both have multiple endpoints associated with a DID and that the endpoint can be a URI.

</p>
<p><strong>saholman</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 15:51:56 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>saholman</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 15:55:08 GMT):<br/>
Ok, that makes sense. Sounds like a great agency implementation!  The way to do that now is to have a forward message arrive at the agency with a "to" field that contains a DID.  The agency should then know which agent the message should go to based on that did.  This isn't really set in stone though, so if you have a better way to do it go for it! :slight_smile:  For more information on the forward message, look at @mhailstone's post awhile back with the PUML document and see how we are using forward messages.  https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=FP87hvzPgWDz8W9sD

So I must send the wallet name NOT encrypted, as additional request param

<p><strong>bdeva</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 16:23:56 GMT):<br/>
@VitalijReicherdt We had similar issues with multi-wallet support and routing. As an intermediate solution until the message formats are finalized we created a unique endpoint for each wallet and keep track which endpoint fits to which wallet. Unfortunately up until now endpoints cannot be stored in the ledger that contain URLs but just IP:port. We pass on the endpoints in the connection_offers/requests instead of storing them on the ledger until this limitation is fixed.

</p>
<p><strong>saholman</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 16:27:05 GMT):<br/>
@VitalijReicherdt You probably need to send every message intended for one of those wallets to the sovrin steward endpoint first (what we call the agency endpoint) so that you can decrypt the message the same way each time.  
</p>
<p><strong>bdeva</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 16:31:09 GMT):<br/>
This also became handy when implementing a cloud agent/agency which provides endpoints to multiple mobile edge agents.
</p>
<p><strong>bdeva</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 16:43:37 GMT):<br/>
@saholman I think the multi-wallet case makes sense when running multiple users (for example different branches of the same organization that require separate access) on the same instance of the agent implementation.

</p>
<p><strong>saholman</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 16:56:43 GMT):<br/>
@bdeva Maybe, but based on the Friday agent discussions I think it makes the most sense to have those agents behind an agency.  That being said though, your idea of separate endpoints seems like it would also work!
</p>
<p><strong>bdeva</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 17:05:48 GMT):<br/>
@saholman Are the descriptions of the different kind of agents (cloud agent/agency, mobile edge agent, etc.) in the readme of the indy-agent repo up to date with the Friday discussions or are there any significant changes to that? 
</p>
<p><strong>saholman</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 17:10:54 GMT):<br/>

Here's an introductory look at the slides for my presentation on JWMs friday. I assume there's going to be a lot of questions since I haven't shared many details about them so far. I'd greatly appreciate comments or questions that you have about them so I can address them in the slides of the presentation and be prepared friday to discuss. https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y-r0zbugF0-j75GUWBC_3tIHDokPa8f1eQYU6IW14N8/edit#slide=id.g40985f9265_0_43

@mhailstone @ryanwest6 let me know about your PR against his connection protocol HIPE. He asked me to take a look at it before merging it himself and just haven't had a chance to look at it-- sorry to become a blocker on the HIPE. It looks like I have some discussions to catch up on regarding the connection protocol but before I got behind, I was working on a revision that you can find [here](https://github.com/dbluhm/indy-hipe/tree/connection-protocol/text/connection-protocol). In my revision, I spent a little more time thinking and taking about the key/crypto negotiation. I also tried to streamline the format a bit. I'm not committed to using my revision over direct revisions of Ryan's original PR but if anyone has comments for one way or the other, I'd be happy to hear them.

All,
Apologize so late. Here is the link to the video folder for last Friday’s call:

</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 19:58:07 GMT):<br/>
Many of you are familiar with Evernym's Connect.Me application. We want to contribute it to the Indy community to make it a reference mobile agent, but there is some work to do to remove dependencies on Evernym's agency and Sovrin specific technology. However, we want people to see what we have done, so here is a preview of the code:
https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-connector-preview
Note the lack of an open source license. We still need to finalize a lot of things.

Anyone using the indy-agent to connect to a local (docker) pool?
I am having trouble ledgering an agent DID with an endpoint.
The code sets up a steward which is only stored in the wallet.
The ledgering the agent did fails because the steward verkey cannot be found

We should be aiming for code and resolve, but we are running on a lot of assumptions in our HIPEs about DIDocs and the sdk parts that haven't been coded or thought through

<p><strong>saholman</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:21:12 GMT):<br/>
For those trying to run the new modular agent, you will need to change the path in the config.yml file to point to your modules directory until we get the modules_path setup.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:23:46 GMT):<br/>
Since the agents are intended to be executables, should we just use PATH?
</p>
<p><strong>saholman</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:26:46 GMT):<br/>
We could, but I don't think that makes sense yet since these executables aren't intended to be called from the command line by a person.  We could just have it check in the modules directory though, so just `../modules` from where the agent is running.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:46:26 GMT):<br/>
I understand that there were some questions on the call today about libvcx, and the progress we are making integrating it into the Indy SDK.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:47:47 GMT):<br/>
The current status is that the pull request is merged, but we consider the library experimental.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:48:25 GMT):<br/>
It still depends on the proprietary Evernym Agency, and the Evernym manner of creating agent connections. We need to bring it inline with the standard used in the reference agents.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 18:24:00 GMT):<br/>
You can track the work here:
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/IS-849

<p><strong>peacekeeper</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 19:13:16 GMT):<br/>
What's the current status/roadmap for microledgers? Is this available (even in an experimental form)? I can't see this topic on the roadmap: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/indy/roadmap
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 19:36:13 GMT):<br/>
Lovesh has been working on some POCs. The Evernym Indy team won't be adding it to our roadmap until we see the results of his efforts.

I am using the Indy-agent together with the docker nodes from indy-sdk and the genesis file from the cli directory
The Steward is setup with the seed: 000000000000000000000000Steward1
Then when the nym is signed and submitted I get:
`Some(NodeReply("{\"reason\":\"client request invalid: UnauthorizedClientRequest(\'Th7MpTaRZVRYnPiabds81Y is neither Trustee nor owner of ...`
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 08 Sep 2018 06:32:00 GMT):<br/>
cli:
`ledger get-nym did=Th7MpTaRZVRYnPiabds81Y`
results in:
```Following NYM has been received.

</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 08 Sep 2018 06:32:33 GMT):<br/>
where V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe6f is a TRUSTEE
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 08 Sep 2018 06:33:57 GMT):<br/>
If I can't send a nym to the ledger with the Steward DID then how do I use the TRUSTEE DID (I only have the Steward seed)
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 08 Sep 2018 06:54:32 GMT):<br/>
So it works if I make use of the seed: 000000000000000000000000Trustee1

1/ For a prover, is it mandatory to receive a "credential offer" to be able to send a "credential request" ? Or how can an actor send a "credential request" to an issuer without "credential offer" ?
2/ How can a prover retrieve a "credential definition" (apparently to be done by an issuer) ?
Thanks

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 15:23:36 GMT):<br/>
@json - just reran the script on Win10 and it worked fine.  The other thing I've found is problematic is how the IP address is being set - the lines in the manage script where `DOCKERHOST` is set.  Do you get a "command not found" error with that?  If so, you could replace that with the following and see if that helps - `export DOCKERHOST=${APPLICATION_URL-$(docker run --rm --net=host codenvy/che-ip)}`

@haggs  Not sure what steps you're referring to? I grabbed the head of master from the indy-agent repo, and tried docker compose build. It seems that the pool of nodes ip/ports are defined in docerk-compose.yml? Also, from within the docker host I can ping each of the nodes by their IP (173.17.0.x), I can also ping them from the host machine by adding a static route throguh the docker VM to get to that subnet. And I did port forwarding on VirtualBox's adapter (see screenshot)

@json Yeah this is a problem with where your IndySDK is sending messages. IndySDK is configured to send messages to 10.0.0.2 (the IPs are statically set in this file - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/cli/docker_pool_transactions_genesis) change the IPs in this file locally to 127.0.0.1 or change the IP of your docker network to match the file and it should work.

Hi, I'm just beginning to explore the indy-agent repo.  Is there any swagger doc (or other) for the user-to-agent and/or agent-to-agent protocol?

<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Fri, 14 Sep 2018 19:39:39 GMT):<br/>
@smithbk Great initial question. :) But, there actually isn't any swagger document because the protocol is meant to be transport agnostic. A good place to start might be to familiarize yourself with the indy-hipe repository. Here is the PR on the connection protocol: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/928eb157e1672199f1a9e7405ecd1c0e7b6658be/text/connection-protocol/README.md

Hey all. Managed to get indy-agent running on Linux using docker-compose. Guess there's some problems with docker on windows. Anyways, now that it's running I have a problem where the browser just hangs when visiting localhost:3XXX, sometimes it pulls the login form but other times it's just blank, and I can't log in anyawys (Can't fill in the form or click login button). Any ideas?

@mhailstone @danielhardman or anyone else that may happen to know: I am currently reviewing the connection protocol HIPE, in particular @mhailstone's most recent edits when I came to the idea of "connection keys." Can one of you define what a connection key is for me and its intended use along with how connection keys might be used when connections weren't initiated with an invitation (in the case that Alice is connecting with Faber and just sends a Connection Request to Faber's agent using information published to the ledger)?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 00:48:20 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm connection keys are one time use keys used encrypt the request and response and then thrown away. This is done to prevent the key from being able to correlate two parties from their out of band channel to the connection messages later. As for the second question, I'm not sure we went through this. On one hand, you could use the same protocol where the invitation is sent directly to the agent. More efficiently, I could see Alice sending a offer (aka response) first and then the request is sent back from Faber to alice using the information in the Did Doc provided in the offer.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=q8aRfdYMNEsGRp4bD) @dbluhm If an invitation is not initiated, which I highly doubt because an agent needs to have the information contained in the invitation somehow before a Connection Request is given, then all the normal information inside a Connection Request is sufficient. There is no need to use a "connection key" because the agent receiving the Connection Request is assumed to know how to route/handle that message when the sending agent sends the Connection Request message.

</p>

is there any difference between cloud agents and hubs, or they have lot in common

I heard the test suite was mentioned on the call today. Here's an update: the test suite is ready to be used. However, that doesn't imply that it is complete. Tests need to be implemented and I'm happy to help but I do not claim sole responsibility for test development.

<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Sun, 23 Sep 2018 03:59:23 GMT):<br/>
There are differences between ID hubs and Agents as they are currently being considered by their respective communities (who are also collaborating). A key difference I believe is that agents are designed to handle verifiable credentials (and DIDs) while ID hubs contemplate containing all kinds of personal data that may or may not be verifiable claims based. 
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Sun, 23 Sep 2018 03:59:39 GMT):<br/>
There are other differences and well for sure.

I have been going over the python indy-agent and want to start hacking away at it, but before I start is there any updates coming down the pipe for this?
</p>
<p><strong>n3m</strong> (Sun, 23 Sep 2018 16:26:10 GMT):<br/>
@Dubh3124 Are you asking will there be new functionality or will the code change ?
4 The thing with the agents in the ind-agent repo is that they are not complete or compatible. At the current moment there is an effort on standardizing the Agent Protocol so that Interoperability can be achieved.

This is happening on different fronts:
-- Between the parties inside the Indy ecosystem so that all agents that live there can talk to each other
-- Between various different Identity Projects so that different Identity systems can communicate with each others

Short answer is, there will be updates that will change the inner working of the agents that exist in that repo, but I am not sure if those are the updates you were asking about.

Every agent has a different owner, so functionality wise I am not familiar what the roadmap for those agents looks like.

Oops I didn't post the indy-agent link I was referring to; https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent/tree/master/python . I am mainly asking about both functionality and code change. I am just trying to keep/stay current with Indy, nothing I am working is production code. Actually, in regards to creating another agent, there is a project called Quart which is Flask-like ASGI framework and wanted to integrate the two.

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 17:28:08 GMT):<br/>
I'd like to suggest a feature that could be added to A2A comms. This feature, if we pursued it, might modify our threading spec slightly, or it might be totally orthogonal. The feature is what I'll call "thread tracing." It is a way to track what is happening in a complex interaction, across multiple parties, for troubleshooting purposes. I imagine it as something that reports to a sink (monitor of some kind) the arrival of a new message in a thread at a particular party, such that it becomes possible to say: "Oh, the credential offer has been received by 3. Oh, the credential request has been emitted by 7." And so forth.

Evernym has learned that this sort of tracing would be invaluable in troubleshooting; even when Evernym agents comprise both halves of an interaction, and even when the interaction is relatively straightforward, there are still ways that the protocol can get stalled, and sometimes it can be very hard to debug them. When all elements of the software stack for both parties are not owned by the same software vendor, it gets vastly more complex... Besides troubleshooting, there may also be some auditing use cases.

Of course, this feature subverts privacy, so it would have to be totally voluntary. I imagine a sender registers a desire for an interaction to be traced by external monitor/sink X, and then every participant in the interaction decides whether they are willing to honor the request by reporting the progress of the interaction to that monitor when it touches them. I could imagine a tech support person some day trying to help someone figure out why Alice is not able to complete an interaction, and asking her to turn on interaction tracing and doing an experimental, non-privacy-dependent experiment so they can observe where something is stalling.

Is it worth writing a HIPE about this?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=zys7A7f8WahziYnp3) @danielhardman I think the need for cross-whatever debugging is pretty fundamental to a good developer experience. The need to see (and likely export) recent messages sent/received by an agent will help that. A tool that combines exported logs from different agents for browsing on a timeline would make that very actionable. What you are proposing sounds like a real-time version of that. You run a tool that gives you an HTTP debugging URI, and you give that to the agents you are testing. Those agents then all send those reports to the debugging service for inspection.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 21:25:07 GMT):<br/>
To avoid either another spec discussion, or too much reliance on a self-reporting protocol, what if it was just a webhook that consumed json?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 21:26:11 GMT):<br/>
the agent has the choice on how to filter which messages it sends to the webhook, and it feels very developer-ish (which it should).
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 26 Sep 2018 01:12:02 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman - good approach! We're big on making any eco-system developer-friendly and I agree that this will be big help for that.  Obviously has to be default off and easily turned off again once activated.  But I agree, the distributed debugging will be hard enough, and nice to have a built in monitor without having to add log messages in for debugging.  Definitely HIPE-worthy.

<p><strong>Dubh3124</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 04:43:15 GMT):<br/>
So for testing purposes I am mimicking the agent 2 agent onboarding process by storing Agent1's agent1_agent2 (steward_faber_did for similarity) did and verkey in Agent2's wallet. I noticed after storing the did and verkey (did.store_their_did), when listing the dids in Agent2's wallet the did/verkey I stored doesn't show. However, I can still use did. key_for_local_did to get the verkey. Is this by design?

@TelegramSam @mhailstone @swcurran I've updated the AMES HIPE which describes the pack/unpack functions. https://github.com/kdenhartog/indy-hipe/tree/AMES/text/AMES I'd like to go over it tomorrow on the Agent call. Could you take a look over it before then?

@kdenhartog - I'm not going to be able to review it or be on the call.  :-(.  Sorry about that - hanging out in Salt Lake City and being kept very busy...

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=ndQcdASCJ6cmgcuZn) @kdenhartog Will do! Thanks for preparing to talk on that tomorrow. Sorry for the delay. RocketChat crashed on me and just saw this thread.
</p>
<p><strong>mhailstone</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 00:25:13 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog I like the HIPE. The only question/comment I have currently is why have the pack methods return two possible outputs: JSON serialization or Compact serialization? Even thought it's an extra step in the process, it still is an extra step. It's not a big deal, but I'm curious to understand. Maybe that result is common for the JWE spec? Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 05:50:33 GMT):<br/>
Originally, that's how it was done to fit with JWEs. In my current rewrite, I've removed the compact serialization.

@arunwij It is important that you keep the user details separate, such as wallets and connections. Outside that, you can use any user/process arrangement that you need for your purposes.

All,
Here is the link to the video of today’s call:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Kh0kESOIO9au6ecqwY8UQEWoYPVvzdtN

Much appreciation to @kdenhartog  for sharing where his work on the pack/unpack functions are in the Indy-SDK and the associated AMES HIPE (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/43).
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 16:13:54 GMT):<br/>
Update relevant to call today. I'm not going to be adding the functionality @TelegramSam proposed for parsing "to" keys out. This is much easier to do this in Python or Node.js and I'd prefer not to hold this work up. If someone feels it's absolutely necessary to have at the SDK layer, please make a PR request against my branch and I'll merge it in.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=Bx9HJxqH2XoLDBLNW) @dbluhm it'll help as long as unpack wants the verkey as an argument. I'm planning to make a PR for this, but if you try you'l beat me to it.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 03:33:09 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog - my $0.02CDN on this.

Extracting the "to" verkey is not be sufficient for the edge-to-edge encryption case, and not needed for the Wire Message and Forward use cases.What is needed is either the "from" verkey or the "from" DID#key.  Without one of those, the Recipient will not know from whom the message came - both the DID and the agent within the DIDs domain is needed. I believe that information will need to be included in EVERY message where the recipient needs to know that (there might be a few where that is not needed).

With the "to" verkey, a utility could be written to find the "from" DID, but that would still not let the Recipient know the "from" agent. Assuming the authorization will be based on knowing the Agent - and assuming replying to the message also requires knowing the Agent - we need more than the "to" verkey.  We don't want information about the sender in the header, so that information must go in the ciphertext.

Am I missing something?  Given that, I would say unpack() does not need to be extended to return the to verkey.

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 07:06:36 GMT):<br/>
The"from" key is already included, but you make a great point about adding the full key. Thanks for pointing this out, this should be fine for now. In the future, let's double back on this and make sure messages won't correlate two DIDs communicating based on messages going back and forth.

Also, as an update I've got the code encrypting and partially decrypting right now. It appears I have some bugs in how things are going encoding and decoding. Additional tests need to be written this week to find the bug and get everything working.
</p>
<p><strong>baconsandwich</strong> (Tue, 09 Oct 2018 13:31:57 GMT):<br/>
Am I correct, that it is the agents responsibility to store the DIDs of NYMs that "are known" to a user but not owned by him (in his wallet)? For example when a Trustee or Stewart writes a new NYM to the ledger how do they retrieve the list of known DIDs?
</p>
<p><strong>baconsandwich</strong> (Tue, 09 Oct 2018 13:33:03 GMT):<br/>
Consequentially an agent would have to maintain a list by himself.

Ok, nvm. I believe it's compiled when built, ```build:

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 15:57:33 GMT):<br/>
@baconsandwich the agent is responsible for storing DIDs that they plan to interact with. Think of this storage like a caching mechanism. They are not responsible for storing the DIDs of everyone though, which is instead the ledger's job. The ledger can be queried to update the wallet as well. Also, in the case of relationship DIDs that are stored off chain, their wallet acts as the caching mechanism for all updates that they've been told by the owner of the DID and related metadata that is being stored in the wallet. These off chain DIDs use microledgers to handle this, which is well documented in the HIPE repo pull request.

Got it working.  Now to figure out what to do with it.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 21:29:29 GMT):<br/>
OK - done for now - I was able to start up two agents and create a wallet for each (once). I could not get them to connect - not sure what "endpoint" was intended to be.  I'm sure there is more to be done to get this going.  I have the code live mounted, but have not tested using it that way.

It would be good to get a live demo to know what is supposed to happen.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 23:11:57 GMT):<br/>
Put in a PR for the work that I just did.  If you want to try it, you can clone this repo - https://github.com/swcurran/indy-agent and then see the instructions in the python folder and the docker-compose-manage.md

I could not get a connection to happen yet, but I think I just need to spend a bit more time with the devs to figure out why.

<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Thu, 18 Oct 2018 00:16:25 GMT):<br/>
The endpoints that you're supposed to hit are not currently very obvious. We need to add this in to the documentation. But connection offers should hit the endpoint `/offer` and you need to include http. So to send one to local host on port 8080, the string would be `http://localhost:8080/offer`
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Thu, 18 Oct 2018 00:16:46 GMT):<br/>
Not sure if this is the issue you are experiencing or not @swcurran 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 18 Oct 2018 00:29:19 GMT):<br/>
No luck - but a different error.  The Sender agent gets an error, the Recipient agent doesn't get anything (not surprising).  Here's the stack trace:

<p><strong>arjunkhera</strong> (Thu, 25 Oct 2018 12:31:01 GMT):<br/>
@arunwij , this is an open ended question. Think about it like this, in real world, when you are born you don't have any previous credentials. You always build them up as time passes. Indy is just a means of providing the ability to share and manage credentials in the digital form. So for example, if Indy was to be made live today, efforts will be made to onboard existing physical credentials in a digital form first. The network will gain the necessary traction only with time and usage.
</p>
<p><strong>twshelton</strong> (Thu, 25 Oct 2018 13:39:18 GMT):<br/>
@arunwij Initially I think we'll follow the same norms we follow today.  Physical contact will likely be the best approach initially to establish a connection but there are different approaches to handle cases where physical contact is not possible such as a dead-drop at a trusted virtual location.  Once the connection is made, credentials can be issued as needed.  For example, you may  need to visit your university to collect your transcripts after graduation. You would establish a connection with the university at that that time and they can issue you a VC (diploma).

@arjunkhera @twshelton Thank you for the answers. @twshelton can you explain what are the approaches we can use when a physical connection is not possible? Can we have a consensus-based mechanism, where reputed trust anchors or identity owners vote for our initial self-attested identity?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=vxyvm2EFQvashpi9P) @arunwij Here is a lnk to a Medium article by a colleague in the Canadian government. It describes how we are approaching these kinds of questions in the identity space. https://medium.com/@trbouma/trusted-digital-identity-processes-and-methods-25cfbfbbee2e
What you are talking about here are processes by which identity verification can be accomplished. 
In the end I tend to divide up the question of trust into two parts ... is there a trustworthy technical means to transmit bits from A to B (I think we are approaching this with Indy and other decentralized identity tech) and secondly do I trust the processes by which the issuer issued those bits to some entity. That is a social / business / legal question that each verifier needs to answer for themselves. If a group of verifiers get together and come to a shared view on what these trusted processes should be then we might call that a trust framework ... becauce this is a shared view amongst a group describing the set of conditions whereby they will trust the data issued by issuers adhering to the processes described in the trust framework

<p><strong>darrell.odonnell</strong> (Fri, 26 Oct 2018 16:40:05 GMT):<br/>
for next week's (short) discussion about App / Agent / Wallet I will toss out a question to seed some thinking: *Is Evernym's Connect.Me a Wallet? An App? An Agent?*
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 26 Oct 2018 17:37:45 GMT):<br/>
My preferred answer to @darrell.odonnell 's question is:

 ```Connect.Me IS an app. It HAS a wallet. The app USES an agent as one of its components.```

I like this answer because it maps most clearly to the architectural paradigms I want to advocate. But I must acknowledge that others are using the terms differently. So I'm recommending/advocating on the basis of preference here, not necessarily on the basis of how terms are widely used. 
</p>
<p><strong>darrell.odonnell</strong> (Fri, 26 Oct 2018 18:00:55 GMT):<br/>
Cool and that aligns with my general concept. So further questions:  *Do multiple Agents use a single Wallet? Similarly, do multiple Apps have access to a single Wallet?*
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 26 Oct 2018 19:55:09 GMT):<br/>
Typically, a mobile app consists of a front end that runs on the mobile device, and a back end that runs in the cloud. I can imagine several different app development paradigms that give different answers to Darrell's questions:

1. A rich agent like the one inside Connect.Me could cooperate with an equally rich cloud agent owned by the same person, such that the "app" has two agents "in" it -- one in the cloud, and one on the mobile device.

2. A dumb app has no real agent code running inside it, but it hosts web views that are built entirely by a cloud agent. The wallet and all state are stored by the back end. Thus, there is no real agent on the mobile device, but only one agent--and it's in the cloud.

3. A rich agent like the one inside Connect.Me is installed alongside thin agents (see http://bit.ly/agents-by-complexity) that each specialize in a single pairwise relationship. So Alice has Connect.Me on her phone, but also a Sovrin-enabled Fitbit app, and a Sovrin-enabled banking app, and a Sovrin-enabled app from her school, etc. These thin agents note that the rich agent has registered to handle URIs of type "ssi://". They use URI-based message passing to pass A2A messages back and forth between themselves and the rich agent. The thin agents ask the rich agent to store the key and DID and credentials for their one relationship in the rich agent's wallet, and they each possess a key that they use to authcrypt the A2A messages that they exchange with the rich agent. This allows multiple apps to have Sovrin/Indy features, but only one app to be the master gatekeeper for the wallet. (If we don't do something like this, then each Sovrin-enabled app will silo the person's identity; you'll have the identity shard for Fitbit, and the identity shard for banking, etc). You'll also have a problem with independent link secrets.
</p>
<p><strong>darrell.odonnell</strong> (Fri, 26 Oct 2018 20:14:59 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman your #3 sounds to me like Agents (Connect.Me and the "thin ones") hitting a single wallet. I would love to see a strong line drawn between Agent & Wallet to see where the thin agent would talk to the Wallet. I need to think and doodle on this one though.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=KBLTbwyyAv3ttcPkR) Thank you for the explanation @jljordan_bcgov. This is far more complicated than what I thought earlier. I have gone through the article and yes, identity verification processes what I am looking for. I get that, we need to create some kind of agreement between issuers (create trust framework). I have gone through the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework as well. Do you have any information on how actually this digital trust framework work which steps initial identity owner should take (some example). If you have some info let me know. Thank you again for the guidance.

It will be a bit of information overload but here is a like to a github repo with some drafts where you can find the kind of conformance criteria I’m pointing to ... https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF/blob/master/verified-person/verified-person.md @arunwij [ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=sSZjxzibmdSkPm99i)
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Sat, 27 Oct 2018 15:02:35 GMT):<br/>
If you look around that repo you will find quite a few documents that would comprise a national level trust framework

We should add that to hyperledger/indy-agent/python README.md as well as @swcurran 's forked repo which has the (really convenient and nice) .manage scripts for docker-compose-manage.md.  Alternatively we could conditionally check for the `http://` inside the agent code?

<p><strong>Dubh3124</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 23:19:39 GMT):<br/>
Has there been a consensus in regards to packaging/unpackaging agent to agent connections (messages?). I found some information and slides in the indy-agent Google docs on wire messaging but it seems more related to Sovrin. If there is more information in regards to this I would appreciate it.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 23:32:48 GMT):<br/>
@Dubh3124 this is a point of active discussion. The indy-hipe repository contains what has been proposed so far (most of those proposals are still in PRs)
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 23:36:53 GMT):<br/>
There's definitely a more elegant way to handle a bad url than what we're doing now. I think we need more changes with the different exposed endpoints as well. I'll definitely try to get docs updated though (or accept PRs from others with doc fixes)

On the Friday agent call, @smithbk asked a great question about why we wouldn't use TLS between client and server, even if we turned browsers or other web-ish things into static agents. I promised I'd engage on this topic on Rocket.Chat. I spent a bit of time trying to make my thoughts coherent, and came up with the following doc. Would be glad of feedback:

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=fd630298-f17c-4602-9216-011216634965) @dbluhm Sounds like a PR for doc fixes should be in the works. I'll work on a rough draft as there are multiple readme fixes that I can see that might help the community (py env, docker entirely, and a mix in the middle) and others I'm missing.  RE "I think we need more changes with the different exposed endpoints as well."  Just to extrapolate on that, are you referring to non-http endpoints or just different ports and setups (devops specific)? Thanks for the input!
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 02:08:42 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm @TelegramSam  Should I assume the PR I put in about docker-compose is not going to be accepted?  I've not seen any feedback.  We continue to evolve von-image with more features (more of a ledger browser has been added).

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=jQoRT73dARsP8Y2aq) Per #2. I'm wondering if you have a UI that acts like a thin agent, and that way authentication happens the agent way, not some arbitrary user way. In other words, the 'real' agent is in the cloud, but the UI is a special built agent that performs the role of an administrative UI. I'm still thinking through how that UI agent manages keys in a user sane way.

@dbluhm's PR for routing by message families has been merged..
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 00:29:59 GMT):<br/>
I proposed some changes to @dbluhm 's proposed HIPE about message threading. The exec summary is:
1. Rename some fields that were just a little too opaque for my tastes (e.g., "tid" --> "thid"). This is minor.
2. Rework the concept of last sequence number to make it capable of supporting n-wise interactions (e.g., 3 parties trying to coordinate an appointment).
By accident, I merged in all the changes from recent HIPE merges. So it looks like my PR to Daniel Bluhm's PR is big, when it is mostly not. Here's a link to just the substantive part: https://github.com/dbluhm/indy-hipe/pull/2/commits/a6a94c940a5939038bc73df4e32d6d088037da50

As I wrote my tweak, several questions came to my mind that I think deserve larger discussion:

a. Can a particular field in an A2A message have more than one datatype? In my tweak, I suggested that `lrec` could sometimes have a value that's an int, and sometimes have a value that's an array of strings. I'm not sure if this is wise. Would we be better off saying that `lrec` is always an int, and `lrecs` is always an array of strings, and that as a general rule, A2A messages never allow free variation in datatypes (thus being friendlier to stuff like stuffing A2A messages into protobufs and such)?

b. Do we have any conventions on casing or abbreviations? This decorator uses posix style (mashallthewordstogetherinlowercase). I don't love that, but it has the virtue of terseness. Then there's python's snake_case. And of course java's camelCase, and Win32's TitleCase, and CSS's kabob-case. We will probably not be able to impose uniformity on things--after all, anybody can invent message types, and attributes can have whatever names the msg type inventors choose, as long is it makes a JSON parser happy--but for some really core decorators, it might be nice to be consistent... Is that a different HIPE ("best practices in msg family design")?

I've canceled my PR for type spec guidelines, and have a new PR that includes those as updates to a recently approved HIPE by @dbluhm : https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/53
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 15:40:46 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman my above PR has guidelines, but not the one you call out for case. I think we should recommend one style (perhaps strongly) in those guidelines.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 16:28:05 GMT):<br/>
My 2 cents preference for case recommendations, from most to least preferred, is: kabob-case, snake_case, camelCase, posixcase, TitleCase, SHOUTCASE. Unless someone touts SHOUTCASE, I won't argue the virtues or flaws of each one, because I think it's a bit of a stylistic choice based on which programming experiences have been most influential on a person. Maybe we should just run a simple poll and see if there's enough gravitas for any of these options to coalesce around it, and just go where the will of the community takes us.

<p><strong>haggs</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 16:49:11 GMT):<br/>
Just a quick (and probably stupid) question around the HIPE 53 about message families "We propose that message types are ledger resolvable DIDs with an endpoint specifier and path:", will all message families have to be _public_ ledger resolvable?
</p>
<p><strong>haggs</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 16:56:07 GMT):<br/>
Also one vote for kabobCase in the message family names as that seems to have been the convention

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=fmF5KdLXmaEeW8x9m) @haggs IMO, the answer is No.

XML namespaces don't have to resolve--they just have to be unique. If they *do* resolve, that's nifty. But the programming logic rarely cares what might be on the other side of a URI for the namespace; almost invariably, it just cares that a reference is unambiguous.

The value of resolution of XML namespaces is to help human programmers learn about the semantics associated with the namespace. The point of resolution of a DID reference to docs about a message family is the same. It would be a good practice to have them resolve. But if they don't, it wouldn't break run-time use of those message types; it would just make it harder for people to learn what those message types mean.

FYI - document from the DIF folks about message Identity Hub Request and Response.  I've not taken a thorough read, but we might want to add some notes about what we're thinking in the Indy world.

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 10:23:36 GMT):<br/>
I've written a doc that I want to socialize. It relates to DIF Hubs, to DID Auth, to the indywebshim concept I brought up last week, and to a thing I've called "Security Contexts" but never really explained in detail. (In this doc, I changed the term "Security Contexts" to "Message Trust Contexts" because I think it's more expressive.)

The doc aims to refine our thinking on what's trustable in A2A communication under different scenarios.

It's long. I wish I knew how to make it shorter. But if you'll give it some time, I think it has important ideas. Some of them are controversial, and might need some pushback. That's fine.

Maybe we could discuss on the agent call a week from now?

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 15:47:45 GMT):<br/>
I have a terminology suggestion. For DIDs that are not rooted on the public ledger, how about the term "edge DIDs" instead of "microledger DIDs" or "private DIDs"? My reasoning is that I want to write a new DID method, "did:edge", as opposed to "did:sov". Edge DIDs would be the same regardless of the blockchain ecosystem that uses them, and the DID method would be the relationship state machine, whether or not they're persisted with microledgers.

@swcurran Using your dockerize magic for the python agent, I'm running into an error:

```
Step 6/8 : ADD --chown=indy:indy indy_config.py /etc/indy/
ERROR: Service 'webserver' failed to build: Unknown flag: chown
```
I'm guessing this is due to docker version problems? Would you happen to know?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 23:24:48 GMT):<br/>
Quite possibly. Are you up to date on docker?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 23:25:50 GMT):<br/>
That's a current feature of docker - https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#add
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 23:26:10 GMT):<br/>
Not sure when it was added.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 23:26:29 GMT):<br/>
It was added in release v17.09.0-ce.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 23:27:46 GMT):<br/>
We can go back to the old way to do it, which would be two steps ADD and then RUN with a chown linux command
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 23:29:28 GMT):<br/>
My version numbers for docker installed from Fedora repos don't line up with the versioning on the website. I'm looking into it but good to know we have a backup at least.

<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 23:34:07 GMT):<br/>
Hm... If possible, I think it'd be good to stick with packages from the official repositories. I'll switch it to an ADD and a RUN with chown and see if there aren't any other problems.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 23:36:39 GMT):<br/>
I'd guess you aren't on the official platform. You are on a release 13 months old at least.

A question about the threading HIPE proposal (@dbluhm and @TelegramSam): Suppose my application message is a proof request, and suppose it has to be routed through 3 intermediaries between the two edges. What should the ID of the `forward` message be that contains the proof request inside it, in packed/encrypted form? Should there be any relationship between the ID of the forward and the ID of the inner message it contains? If no, then how can an error at an intermediate point in the routing be related to a message known to one of the edges?

Good idea @TelegramSam I can certainly do that
</p>
<p><strong>tlooker</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 19:32:17 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman  My first question is why does there need to be an inner forward. If we end up taking the approach outlined by PR #43 (AMES) then the outer most message will contain information on the recipient(s), so could routing not be done off this information? I imagined the outer most message containing an identifier (i.e the to field in the recipient list) known to both the edge agents i.e a pairwise Did. For each network hop the message would be encrypted with the verkey of the service endpoint for the next network hop, where by each hop would know only where to send the message to next based on their routing table. For example Bob wants to send Alice a message. Alice has a domain endpoint agent, routing agent and edge agent. Bob creates a message then packs it using AMES, in the recipient list is the pairwise verkey of Alices edge agent, he then encrypts this entire message with the domain endpoint verkey and sends it to the domain endpoint (Note: On connection with Bob, Alice configured her routing agent and domain endpoint agent, to each have a routing record, the domain endpoint agent would have a routing record mapping the pairwise verkey to the routing agent endpoint and the routing agent would have a routing record mapping the pairwise verkey to the edge agent). The domain endpoint agent would then decrypt this message, lookup the recipients against its routing records, find a record for the routing agent, re-encrypt the message with the routing agents verkey and send (the process is then repeated until the edge agent is reached).

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 19:46:30 GMT):<br/>
@tlooker - the need for the what amounts 3 wrappings of the data is that there is specific hiding of data from the Domain Endpoint.   Alice encrypts the "Agent Message" (e.g. a Proof Request) to the ultimate recipient's (the Proofer) and also encrypts it as a forward to the recipient's Routing Agent.   Then Alice encrypts that in a forward for the next hop in the process - which could be Bob's Domain endpoint.

Lots of encryption layers, but based on "need to know" information hiding.

<p><strong>tlooker</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 19:49:41 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran yeap I understand the need to hide the message contents from the intermediaries, but say the message is a proof request, if I take that message and pack that using AMES and put the pairwise did as the recipient (in the recipient list) then no intermediary will know the messages contents?
</p>
<p><strong>tlooker</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 19:50:05 GMT):<br/>
sorry I shouldnt say pairwise did as the recipient just the verkey
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 19:50:17 GMT):<br/>
It wasn't so much the message content as the intended recipient.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 19:50:17 GMT):<br/>
It wasn't so much the message content as the intended recipient that drives the need for the extra encryption layer.

</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 19:51:39 GMT):<br/>
AMES has absolutely no effect on the need to use multiple forwards. They're completely orthogonal issues.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 19:52:32 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman I think taking a design stab at the forward message family would help inform the thread/error reporting issue.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 19:53:08 GMT):<br/>
The forward message family was already defined in HIPE 0022 (cross-domain messaging).
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 19:53:23 GMT):<br/>
We could add more detail, but since that HIPE has been merged, I'm assuming it's normative.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 19:54:24 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 19:54:34 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam - keep in touch on the error handling. I'm doing some work on that as well and have some ideas to share.  Hope to have a sketch maybe today or tomorrow.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 19:55:26 GMT):<br/>
I can see expansion of the routing family, specifically inbound routing setup and teardown, but that should be good enough for now.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 19:59:33 GMT):<br/>
And now I'm thinking about which levels of routing you tell others about, and pre-destination routing vs post-destination routing...
</p>
<p><strong>tlooker</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 20:01:24 GMT):<br/>
I understand the drive to want to separate them as that was my original thought too, however wont we be effectively be nesting or duplicating data by having recipients packed inside recipients? @swcurran if I send the domain endpoint a message where the recipient is a verkey, the domain endpoint either knows where to send it next or it doesn't, the most it could know is the next network hop?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 20:04:06 GMT):<br/>
@tlooker I want to expand on my perhaps-cryptic comment about AMES and forwarding being orthogonal.

A design principle that informs many choices about A2A is the idea that an agent doesn't have to know anything about contexts other than their own and their immediate environs. It is theoretically possible to build a system where an intermediary, 2 or 3 steps removed from the final destination of a message, sees that X is the final destination, and takes action accordingly. But we've gone a different way: if an agent isn't the final destination of a message, then the message it receives is a `forward` message that tells it what to do next. That's all. It doesn't see the final destination (good for privacy), and it doesn't care about the type of the thing that it's forwarding.

Thus, all agents, whether they are intermediaries or final destinations, always do the same thing: they open a message *meant for them, NOT someone else*, and run it through a handler. If the handler causes them to subsequently emit another message that was embedded in the message they received (as will be the case for `forward` messages), that's fine--but it's a minor detail. Routing messages are just another message family.

If we wanted AMES to address routing, then we'd have a different system, where routing messages are special.
</p>
<p><strong>tlooker</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 20:15:04 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman Thanks for the clarification, I do understand that we are approaching routing in that fashion I'm just starting to wonder whether routing is more fundamental and therefore should be considered lower level, so rather than have a forwarding message for example each agent would have the common behaviour of lookup the recipient list of a received message and first check if the message is for them unpack and if not check if they know how to route the message. With the current forwarding message approach, how do you envisage sending a message from one edge agent to multiple edge agent i.e alice sends a message from her phone to bobs ipad, laptop and phone? If routing were lower level then Bob could disclose the verkey for each edge agent in the pairwise did doc he shares with alice (via microlegers), Alice could then form the message using AMES with multiple recipients and if the routing table for the domain endpoint agent and routing agent is setup, the messages would be deliverable to all recipients?

What you describe in your last sentence is exactly how it works. We don't need routing to be more low-level to accomplish it.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 20:22:22 GMT):<br/>
@tlooker we could expand a forward message to have multiple destinations to help that problem. There is also the case where the 'destination' as known by the sender is actually an intermediate agent, such as the user's cloud agent. The cloud agent may know more about how to do the final hop and can route the message to the real, final, destination.

Is there a payment model defined for agencies, stewards to get paid in Indy based identity network. 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 20:47:37 GMT):<br/>
There is a payment handler interface into which a payment mechanism can be plugged. The interface would easily model Bitcoin, and almost as easily model Ethereum. It could also be adapted to something like Venmo or Paypal with more thought. There is an implementation of this payment interface called libnullpay that lets you pretend to do payments. The Sovrin Foundation has implemented the interface for a token that they are releasing.

I have raised a PR for defining a file format for agent wire messages and for application plaintext messages. It's quite simple and, I think, not controversial. Would be glad of feedback. https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/717d8e59c59600969c5ca37dd44fdabf69321dd7/text/agent-file-format/README.md

@danielhardman Thank you. I also want to know how identity owners, identity issuers get charged using this network. Is there a transactional cost? (so agencies, and stewards get paid per transaction count? )
</p>
<p><strong>arunwij</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 05:21:26 GMT):<br/>
I heard about paid credentials as well. 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 05:39:15 GMT):<br/>
On transactional cost: maybe. It will depend on whether someone is "sponsored" or not. If you're a refugee, you may not have to pay anything, for example. But most people will have to pay a small fee (probably a cent or two) to write a record to the ledger.

Paid credentials are a thing--but they are not associated with any ledger writes, so that's independent.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 05:55:13 GMT):<br/>
(My previous answer is an answer for *Sovrin*, not for Indy. Indy doesn't have any requirement that anything incur fees. It just has a hook to which fees can be attached, if a particular instance of Indy decides to do so.)
</p>
<p><strong>arunwij</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 07:16:26 GMT):<br/>

My feedback added to the the following Medium.com article: https://hackernoon.com/the-one-thing-missing-from-erc-721-standard-for-digital-collectibles-on-the-blockchain-9ee26e4a918c
Once a Non-Fungible Entity (e.g. [Person], [Organization], [Thing], Cryptokitty, Purchase Order, Invoice, Shipping Instructions, Delivery Confirmation, etc.) have been fully realized and encased in concrete plus 100 layers of titanium and digitally signed so that it can never be altered, why can't it be accessed using a trusted service within a smart contract VM?…why can't there be a set of simple standard VM-level interop methods for querying any NFE found anywhere on the planet, selecting an entity or entities from the result set, and then calling on a standard set of accessors to deserialize the properties desired by a smart contract invocation which, in turn, is being called by an off-chain app or another on-chain smart contract?
</p>
<p><strong>mwherman2000</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 19:44:23 GMT):<br/>
Is anyone aware of a blockchain/VM project that is already undertaking this approach for direct NFE access from a smart contract?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 22:42:40 GMT):<br/>
I added a slide to explain what I understood about @TelegramSam 's perspective on our agent call just now: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UnC_nfOUK40WS5TD_EhyDuFe5cStX-u0Z7wjoae_PqQ/edit#slide=id.g47063b60f4_0_9. Sam, I tried to capture it accurately; did I?

I also added some verbiage to slide 3 (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UnC_nfOUK40WS5TD_EhyDuFe5cStX-u0Z7wjoae_PqQ/edit#slide=id.g46da93b149_0_287) to explain why I was getting tripped up on the use of "public". There are 2 squares that are public, not 1. When Sam used the word, I think he meant top right square. I was trying to suggest that most of his benefits could be accomplished in the bottom right square, which is "Anywise" but "Private".

I think the Hybrid model that Sam described is going to show up in the ecosystem. I'm less confident that it should be best practice, or that we should embrace it now. I do think it will require coding support in libindy that is not currently planned, over and above microledger support.

Regarding the use of ledger-based DIDs for pairwise connections: if we proceed down this road and allow implementations based on them, then individuals (not just orgs) can do this. This has GDPR ramifications because the ledger does not have a right-to-be-forgotten mechanism. So when I hear the argument, "look, we already have pairwise DID support implemented, if we use the public ledger to store them", I get a sick feeling in my stomach. As soon as there is 1 personal DID on the public ledger, the ledger is susceptible to lawsuit about right-to-be-forgotten. This may not be a problem for Indy, generally--but for Sovrin, it is a big deal. Some stewards are very nervous about it.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 22:44:12 GMT):<br/>
Perhaps this concern could be mitigated by only allowing trust anchors to write to the ledger, and by instructing trust anchors to only write DIDs for orgs...
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 22:49:57 GMT):<br/>
I think we need to focus more discussion on how we can accelerate getting microledger functionality released into indy-sdk.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 22:51:39 GMT):<br/>
I agree with Daniel H that some of the Hybrid model is concerning.  @TelegramSam do you mean this as an ontology and terminology breakdown or intend that there are serious uses for non pairwise keys for interactions beyond credential issuance?

On that note, what if we roll out some more functionality and just assume some things? Seems like the agent WG is very forward thinking rightly so, but in the meantime what do we know for sure and can implement for sake of practicality.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 22:56:54 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman is a way to address the public or microledger handling be to have DID-create/update code in libindy know when instructed to write a DID to where it should be replicated? E.g Could it know to either makes a call to the ledger or invokes the appropriate A2A messages.

Re: Isn't Right-To-Be-Forgotten from a "DID on the ledger" perspective self-managed and covered by the elimination of the endpoint referenced in the DIDDoc and the deletion of the associated private keys?  If there is no functioning endpoint and no way to decrypt a message, how are you remembered from a DID?  If another organization recorded your DID, then it is that organization that needs to forget it, not the ledger.

I'm sure its a far more complicated question than that. :-)

Is there going to be an official agent to release in the future? Or only reference agent is on the plan? Should we develop the agent all by our own?

<p><strong>gy8409i</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 01:32:54 GMT):<br/>
Another question is the ppt shared today in the meeting about "Public DIDs for Private Relationships" is still under discussion or you have got a conclusion?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 04:23:28 GMT):<br/>
@gy8409i We did not reach a conclusion yet. See above.
Re. release of an agent: People have to write their own agents. Reason: everybody wants different things from their agents. However, a couple of the reference agents that we're about to release are *substantial* efforts with a lot of useful features. One is a reference mobile app, for example. I think it will be possible to get large amounts of value from some of the reference agents (basically, use one as the core of something you want to release), not just study the code and build your own from scratch.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 04:25:34 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran : GDPR experts say that it IS more complicated than that. But I'm not such an expert. Elizabeth Reneiris (Global Policy Counsel at Evernym) has been testifying before EU policymakers on this issue, along with a number of other lawyers. She is pretty adamant about this conclusion. I think @drummondreed may also know something. I refer you to them.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 04:31:04 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran re. "way to address the public or microledger handling": Yes. The way to switch codepaths would be to look at the DID method (if looking at "did:sov:...", go to the Sovrin ledger; if looking at "did:peer:...", go into microledger mode). That's code that has to be written, but mostly it's associated with microledger work, so I wouldn't count that work as completely "extra." There's also code that would have to be written to propagate relationship information to the other party in a connection, any time you change your own keys or authorizations. Again, that's not "extra", over and above microledger tasks. But there's also changes to how DIDs can be used as an index, and that work *is* extra--required only by the Hybrid mode, and not by what we have today or what we'd build for hyperledgers. It's code that uses the sender rather than the target of a message to look up the relationship that should be provide context for a message. That's the main code I don't want to write.
</p>
<p><strong>gy8409i</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 04:41:53 GMT):<br/>
Is there any cloud agent implementation guidance yet?
</p>
<p><strong>gy8409i</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 04:46:15 GMT):<br/>
I saw the architecture design that if I'm running an agency and a lot of cloud agents for each of my customer, I should at least implement provisioning extension and routing extension. Here is the source doc I referenced https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/master/doc/design/005-dkms/images/image_9.png
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 05:22:41 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran The GDPR and blockchain question is indeed quite a deep one with no clear answers yet. I highly recommend this paper that the EU Blockchain Observatory published just a few weeks ago:  https://www.eublockchainforum.eu/sites/default/files/reports/20181016_report_gdpr.pdf

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 16:05:01 GMT):<br/>
Late thought: We have been heavily discussing peer DIDs, but I have not heard this from any other SSI community member. So, either we need to evangelize heavily and reach perfect adoption, or we WILL need to allow support for connections with DIDs done poorly on other DID methods. Even if we don't allow them on our own, the ability to create connections between agents this way may be very important.

<p><strong>haggs</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 17:57:19 GMT):<br/>
Still don't understand its guidance, and it uses the words linkability somewhat how we use correlatability.  It seems like the higher value items, like SSN, have to have more protection and less linkability? From that end I think some of this liability falls upon your agent/agency architecture. Just my 2 cents.

anything within an agent can be forgotten, it's the ledger that's the wrinkle.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=xF8jW45NkJj73QfYF) @danielhardman @danielhardman As a developer in the Agent space for quite some time, I've been trying to find a codebase that is close to something I can just fork and contribute to, and I've been having a lot of trouble. There are a couple clear candidates, namely Hyperledger Indy Agent (both nodejs and python agents), libvcx (which is being absorbed into indy sdk), connect.me (unclear how different from the previous one), and the VON agents. I have been attending the Agent WG calls regularly, went to the last two IIW's, and even traveled to Utah for the Agent Summit in August. I came out of that weekend having a lot of energy and thinking that work on a Reference Agent could commence, alongside the Test Suite, to get us all towards basic working agents. In the months since, I've had a lot of trouble getting this momentum going. Me and my colleague Bryant talked to the BYU team for a while, and they quickly let us know that the nodejs agent is more or less on hiatus. Then we started working with some of the Sovrin folks, namely Sam Curren, on the python agent. Obviously these things are a work-in-progress but, for example, I have been working on a Credentials module for the python agent (which currently lacks one--it's something that definitely needs to be built and its fairly well defined).  I have forked this code and, using Indy's anoncreds design & API as a basis, I have stubbed out the features/functions and started to skeleton the code. The Agent itself is somewhat confusing and not well-documented, and I'm quickly realizing I won't be able to use the existing interface to test any of my code. Essentially, I'm trying to study the code in these various repos/languages and synthesize the lessons to port them over to an actual implementation, but finding a simple starting point has been challenging. I'm not trying to sound ungrateful, but attending the calls every week, and creating tickets in Hyperledger JIRA, is still not tantamount to open source collaboration and the idea of a "reference agent" has been floated around for months under different auspices--"it's being worked on", "it's being released soon", "come help build it out", etc. I'm trying to do the latter but I need a little help. With so much interest in Agents, there has to be actual code that we can use & directly contribute to. We're not new to libindy but we're not sdk experts either.

@danielhardman we had discussed the idea that the Sovrin DID method could explicitly allow for a DNS-like hierarchical resolution in the past, meaning I resolve in the local wallet, then to my trusted parties, then to the ledger, in order to allow peer dids and sov dids to look and behave in the "same way" at least from a developer practicality perspective.  The did:peer vs did:sov approach seems to draw a hard line between the two, which in some cases is desirable, but in others quite problematic.  I apologize if I just missed the call or deck with the resoning here, but can you explain why you think the bright line there is helpful?

I'm very nervous about the correlation issues attached with the groupwise construct, I think we'd need the crypto folks to weigh in on that one before we can endorse it

the best distinction we could draw before was public, and "not public"

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 16:52:34 GMT):<br/>
@nage I have a vague recollection of the DNS analogy for DID resolution as something mentioned in passing in a casual way, but in my mind it was not an important concept. I am interested in your comment that the bright line distinction is problematic. Could you elaborate?

To respond to your question about why I think it's helpful: DID methods are tied to legalities, to documented semantics, to trust frameworks, etc. I would think that knowing at a glance which set of assumptions applies to a DID--and not figuring that out in a convoluted way--one potentially alterable outside the creation of the DID itself--might result is much simpler and safer code. But that is more of a gut reaction, not a deeply reasoned argument.

<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 21:41:53 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman I have been thinking more about message routing, would you say that any agent that receives say a forward message will only ever do one thing with that message, i.e forward it? Would there ever be the case where the message is meant for them so the forward message would invoke them handling it themselves? I.e effectively double handling the message?
The reason I think this would be the case and hence why I'd argue routing needs to be more fundamental, is currently the forward message contains the necessary information needed by the final agent in a complete routing scenario, to un-pack the inner content message. Take for example the following case: 

Bob and Alice are already connect and Bob wants to send Alice a message. Alices agent configuration consists of her edge agent and a domain endpoint agent.

1. Bob creates a message and wraps that in a forward message like below.
{
  "@type" : "did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec/routing/1.0/forward",
  "to"   : "did:sov:1234abcd#4",
  "msg"  : "<pack(Message,valueOf(did:sov:1234abcd#4), privKey(A.did@A:B#1))>"
}

2. This forward message is then encrypted with the domain endpoints verkey and sent to the domain endpoint uri.
3. The domain endpoint then decrypts the message to reveal the forward message, invoking the forward message handler, where by the recipient field "to" is matched to a routing record and sent accordingly.

My question is here, do we discard the forward message at this point, and just send the encrypted contents of the "msg" field? If so how does alice unpack this message without knowing the did it was addressed to? This leaves the option of resending the forward message to alice. So she unpacks the same forward message as the domain endpoint did and therefore realising the forward message is for her, she processes the message, effectively twice?


</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 21:44:01 GMT):<br/>
Unless of course the contents of the msg field is not encrypted and instead is a message like that defined in AMES?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 23:05:51 GMT):<br/>
@tplooker Only the inner message is forwarded when forwarding is used in this manner.
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 23:07:55 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam Ok great so the message inside "msg" is an AMES message? With a recipient header allowing the next agent to unpack it?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 23:08:52 GMT):<br/>
Yes.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 23:10:01 GMT):<br/>
and the recipient there isn't leaking anything, because you need the forwarding agent to send it to them anway.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 23:10:01 GMT):<br/>
and the recipient there isn't leaking anything, because you need the forwarding agent to send it to them anyway.
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 23:12:02 GMT):<br/>
Ok but agent unpacking the forward can then see the recipients of inner message?

</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 23:13:18 GMT):<br/>
As it isn't encrypted irrespective of the forward message itself?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 23:15:10 GMT):<br/>
the recipients block of the inner message is basically the same as the to: field in the outer message.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 23:15:20 GMT):<br/>
but the message contents are encrypted
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 23:15:33 GMT):<br/>
so, the agent doing the forwarding does know where the message is going.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 23:16:18 GMT):<br/>
when you have multiple routing steps, only the immediate routing step is visible to the forwarding agent. none of the next steps are visible.
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 23:17:05 GMT):<br/>
Ok cool thats what I thought, just seems like duplication of information though with the recipient information being re-stated at two levels.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Sun, 18 Nov 2018 03:18:03 GMT):<br/>
@tplooker that is true, though it's a fairly minor duplication. Keeping the two layers separate (wire message vs agent message) has some good architectural advantages.

Hi, In terms of agent/user to agent/user messaging:
is indy-agent messaging similar to the messaging used in vcx?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 14:21:10 GMT):<br/>
@PhillipGibb vcx messaging uses a provisional format that works with any other vcx solution. The next version of community accepted messaging formats is not yet complete.

@TelegramSam awesome. I want to start working on something. Where can I start?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 18:59:56 GMT):<br/>
@PhillipGibb you want to start building on top of something for your own solution, or you want to contribute to the reference agent, or both?
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=ZG7Zj7MM6eboPTHw3) @TelegramSam You mean the indy-agent? Both really. I am very happy you contribute and to use. 
I see Messaging Protocol in the docs, is this a protocol that indy agent developers will use for their cloud agents? The part I struggle with is what if there are other issuers and verifiers that do not use that Messaging Protocol - do we need a Message Translator?
So now we have a DID Resolver at DIF
Probably a Schema Resolver - for looking up supported schemas/credential definitions across blockchains
And now a Message Resolver - for translating messages between different agents - eg between uPort, vcx() and indy agents?
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 19:51:48 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam I am happy to start working, start a HIPE? On such a Message Translator for the Community, what do you think?

@PhillipGibb There is the goal of making the base message format the same between uPort, Indy, and DIF Hubs.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 20:49:31 GMT):<br/>
So in that case, no translator would be needed.

This seems to be looping through all DIDs stored in agent's wallet. Is there a better way to figure out the VerKey of the message, instead of doing this sort of brute-force type of search?

@stanleyc-trustscience The new wire message format that @dbluhm referred to contains a 'to' address that will not require trial decryption. The reference agent does so currently as a hack while we wait for that upgrade.

@HiranKumar are you looking to explore indy-agent? If so, you might check Stephen Curren's PR against the indy-agent branch. He has a docker compose script that we are evaluating.

As far as help with indy-sdk / local network issues, you'll find deeper knowledge in the #indy-sdk and #indy-node channels.

</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 15:21:07 GMT):<br/>
on a slightly related note, any opinions on including lodash as a dependency? We use Vue.js, which is intentionally light when compensating for js limitations. Lodash is established and solves many object/array code utility issues.

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 17:17:11 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure what you're referencing here. key is a fairly overloaded term in our space.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 17:17:38 GMT):<br/>
are you thinking of a key as in important values?

or different
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 17:19:48 GMT):<br/>
oh, gotcha. No those are two separate values. Think of a DID as a point that points to important pieces of data like endpoints (how I can send messages to that entity) and keys (how I can authorize that I'm speaking with the correct entity)
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 17:20:10 GMT):<br/>
This data is referred to as the DID Doc
</p>
<p><strong>HiranKumar</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 17:21:47 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>HiranKumar</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 17:22:29 GMT):<br/>
So for communication purpose we are using this endpoint did.right?
</p>
<p><strong>HiranKumar</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 17:23:15 GMT):<br/>
And did is for identifying the entity.right?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 17:26:25 GMT):<br/>
correct, although the endpoint may be a DID (@drummondreed please correct me if this is not spec compliant) most people think of them as URLs

DIDs and associated keys are stored in the wallet. One wallet can store as many DIDs/keys as the wallet owner requires.

@danielhardman and I have proposed a new HIPE about agent to agent messaging error handling that introduces a new message type - "problem-report" that is useful for some categories of errors. The HIPE also describes some (currently) recommended approaches to many error handling categories. There are also some thoughts about adjustments to other HIPEs (threading, tracing and the "Forward" message type) to improve error handling capabilities.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 11:49:11 GMT):<br/>
@HiranKumar what is tour use case - offline use? That is possible with caching, assuming you know what you are going to prove our verify. Only tricky part is agreeing on how fresh the proof of non-revocation the Verifier is willing to accept.

If not about offline use, then the ledger is used to get schema, credential definition and revocation information during proving and verifying.

I have been exploring the idea of writing a did:peer method spec. This would document how to manage a relationship and its associated DIDs and keys purely through peer-to-peer communication. It would not be specific to Indy, though it would be implemented using Indy messaging concepts because A2A addresses many of the mechanisms it needs. Anybody want to collaborate?

@TelegramSam I am thinking that we want a message family that includes the following message types: join_us (that is, provide my genesis txns for kicking off the relationship), leave_us (abandon/terminate my part of a relationship), update_me, reject_update, ack_update. I want to have you teach me about the JSON Diff concept so we can handle any single atomic change in update_me.

Someone contacted me directly to ask for a summary of indy agent status -- basically, "how feasible is it to write an agent, and where is the info that would let me do it?" I thought the answer to that question would be of general interest, so I am reposting what I responded here. Of course, my opinion isn't gospel, but this is how I see it, FWIW.

 danielhardman Technical Ambassador 7:08 AM
The A2A mechanism in Indy is actually composed of several different pieces, and they are documented separately. Each is maturing very rapidly, but each is less than fully mature:

1. A "wire format" that explains how agents serialize and encrypt messages when they send them over an arbitrary transport (bluetooth, SSH tunnel, https, mobile push notifications, etc). The HIPE for this is in Final Comment Period and will likely be merged in a couple weeks: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/43

2. Several HIPEs that describe agent messages at a higher level (when they are JSON and before they get serialized and encrypted): https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0017-agent-message-structure (merged and more or less final), https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0021-message-types (also merged), https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/30, https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/65, https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/64, https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/61

3. Conventions around DID Docs that tell agents how to communicate with one another (merged and more or less final): https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0023-diddoc-conventions. Note that today's Indy Agent call will discuss some further nuances of routing that may end up being written in a different HIPE.

4. Conventions around how agents get connected in the first place (this one is still a bit controversial but is beginning to move toward closure): https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/54

5. Discussions about the notion of microledgers -- how agents can share and persist state for their relationships without using the main public ledger at all. These discussions are probably still a month away from becoming settled, and 2 months away from become an agreed standard. They are the least mature. https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/31, https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/50

6. Reference agents. This is the purpose of the indy-agent repo. That repo contains code contributed by multiple parties, and is likely to contain more as more and more interesting types of agents emerge. For example, I am working on an email-based agent, and I suspect we'll also see an agent for an embedded IoT device soon. There is also a reference edge agent that's a rich mobile app that's in the process of being contributed, and an agent that is a rich cloud agent for a consumer. The agents that are there right now tend to focus more on institutional use cases. All of the code in this repo is in flux and will need updates as some of the HIPEs above get merged and become "official."

The bottom line with all of this is that it is possible to write an Indy agent today, but there are many questions about doing so that are still being answered. As a result, most of the progress on agents is being made by organizations that are willing to thrash a bit and are brave about asking lots of questions and having a few dead ends. There is not a tidy, polished recipe that people can just follow and know that they'll produce exactly what they need, and there is not an "Agent Developer's Guide" yet, either. Both of those things are much needed and will emerge in the next several months, I believe.

Since today's indy agent call is all about routing, I've been meditating lately on how to explain some of our thinking there in an easy way. I worry that some of the routing might feel complex, when it actually falls out of a few basic principles and two roles that add flexibility in a communication chain, "relay" and "mediator". (As I mentioned above, I've also been working on an email-based agent, and this has taken me down a road that forces the more common http-based patterns to be generalized...) I started a doc in HIPE format but haven't raised it as a PR because I became uncertain where it belonged. I'm hoping I can share the doc on the call, for a least a few minutes. But in case the agenda is already filled, here's a link to it for anyone who's interested. https://github.com/dhh1128/indy-hipe/blob/mediators-and-relays/text/mediators-and-relays/README.md

FYI, the Sovrin Connector Application code has now been merged into https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/connector-app. I am in the slow process of learning how it works and how to build it. My goal is to collaboratively create a reference mobile app that conforms to the current A2A communication standards.

@mboyd and anyone else that is keen on a reference mobile app or where to get started, we have just merged in a sample Xamarin app (https://github.com/streetcred-id/agent-framework/tree/master/samples/xamarin-mobile-sample) which consumes the Agent-Framework SDK (repo in which the sample is contained) essentially a c# version of libVCX that is closer in step with the current WG thinking on A2A in general, we are in the process of adding more samples and documentation at the moment.

All: How complete do we want the docker stuff before we approve the PR? I've tested it, and it works well as long as you don't fall into any docker gotchas. I've made it out of a number of those problem areas with a little help from Docker informed folks, but not all those I've documented are mentioned in the PR's readme files.

Thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 05 Dec 2018 22:39:01 GMT):<br/>
I think that overall, the more information we have in the docs, the fewer questions we'll have to answer over and over in chat. So if we can at least link to good resources, I think that would be a welcome addition worth waiting a little longer for.

@tplooker I have mixed feelings about using a message type as a record format.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 10 Dec 2018 16:00:01 GMT):<br/>
Also, I think the 'microledger transmissions' will be part of the message itself.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 10 Dec 2018 16:01:08 GMT):<br/>
But awesome work.
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Mon, 10 Dec 2018 22:40:15 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam I agree the persisted record doesn't need to conform to a message type (will update accordingly), but we will still need this message type for when an agent requests a routing record or records(s) from another agent wont we? 
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Mon, 10 Dec 2018 22:41:07 GMT):<br/>
In general do we think this approach to routing given the potential issues is good enough to proceed with?
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Mon, 10 Dec 2018 22:46:21 GMT):<br/>
Part of me doesnt believe the key squatting concern is a major issue (although there are potential DOS attack vectors). I think routing records should always be updated or exist prior to the update or creation of a dependent DID, because to me updating the DID prior to confirming the message is deliverable would be invalid behavior, regardless of the mechanism used to transmit the DID and or routing record updates?
</p>

Have we standardized anywhere the format of the services section in a DID for types such as "Agency"? I see an example in HIPE 22 by @swcurran but wondering if this has been formally ratified? This is key to the routing approach I am proposing as a routing agent needs to be able to resolve this section of the DID.

@tplooker I've been thinking about routing to keys vs routing to DIDs. Still thinking
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 11 Dec 2018 15:38:30 GMT):<br/>
@tplooker I don't think Key/DID squatting is a problem under two conditions: 1. Practice of registering desired route before publishing it, and 2. requirement to posess a key (or other registration method, such as ledger recording) that relates to the public key / DID being registered. Under those cases (which I believe are easy), we can safely acknowledge the problem and then ignore it.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 11 Dec 2018 15:39:32 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=ZR5ErSJcZH6jiWQ3n) @tplooker Yes and No. An Agency DID is just one that contains an endpoint, rather than a DID of an endpoint. 
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 11 Dec 2018 15:40:41 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=nsTjjj7xMiAS5btNS) @arunwij The nonce provices both the ability to avoid replay attacks, and can give the sender the ability to coorelate a response to a message they sent. @thread mechanisms can also be used for message correlation.

@danielhardman I think we should start calling you the Bard of Agents. That HIPE reads wonderfully—it's like a tutorial on the whole subject of how async and sync/REST can work together. If we can get all our HIPEs to that level of readability, game over :-)

On the HIPE about A2A and synchronous, I am feeling a bit conflicted, myself. I wanted to document the idea, because several people have asked for a solution. But having put it in black and white, I'm wondering if it's worth pursuing. Right now, I think the HIPE should just linger in limbo unless/until significant interest in the topic materializes. If it doesn't, then that tells us the HIPE shouldn't have legs.

So I'll be coming up with a replacement PR as soon as I can get to it.

@swcurran : Today on the agent call you mentioned a concern that ACKs cannot be handled generally because they need protocol-specific knowledge to be useful. You mentioned a similar concern about problem-report. I think I know what you are worried about, but I am not certain. I probably am not quite groking it because I am feeling very confident that a generic ACK and a generic problem-report are nearly always the right answer. So I am probably missing something. I am wondering if you could expound a bit.

Here is the part of the concern that I think I understand: In order to emit an ACK at the right place in, say, a credential issuance protocol, I must have knowledge of what's happening in credential issuance. In other words, on the emitting side, I can't use the ACK in a generic way, but only in a specific context. That seems true to me, but not the source of a concern about the usefulness of general ACK. On the receiving side, if I receive an ACK, I can't handle it generically, but rather in the context of whatever interaction is active. In other words, I have to know things about credential issuance (or protocol X or Y) before I can process the generic ACK. Again, I think this is true. But I don't see why this leads to the conclusion: "we might as well have protocol-specific ACKs". If we did that, then I could share no code and no documentation about ACKs between ACKs as they manifest in protocols X, Y, and Z. It would obscure a general pattern.

What am I missing?

On today's agent call, the topic of attachments came up. @TelegramSam asked if I'd submitted my HIPE proposal on that subject, and I said yes. Then I went back and looked, and I saw that it was still sitting in my fork, not in PR form. So here's that HIPE proposal, as fodder for discussion. An example why this might be relevant is that it would allow us to bridge from the world of A2A messaging to the world of predefined document formats, such as UBL (which is XML-based). Instead of having to convey all info about, say, a purchase order via JSON, we could pass the communication particulars via A2A, but the actual content of the purchase order as an attached UBL doc. And the same could be done for many other formats as well.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=DJhdkFxaFuHoAS9KK) @danielhardman I think the difference is just shades of grey.

As you put it "a generic ACK....are nearly always the right answer".  My thought is that a contextually useful ACK - e.g. most beyond "I received your message" - is "nearly always" specific to a message family and hnce is more complex to handle in a generic function.  Any ACK that needs to know something of the protocal internals (state) needs to be handled (at least partially) by the protocal.

Another way of putting it is that I tend to think of Message Families as a (more or less) independent services, and that any specific instance of an Agent will have a list of registered Message Families and it will be difficult for a Message Family to find out what other Message Families are loaded in the Wallet and is their internal state.  Hence, to know how to get the Message Family-specific information needed for all but the simplest of ACKs will be complex for a generic function.  With that mental model, it's easy to see why I'm on the other end of the spectrum at the usefulness of generic ACKs [FYI "Message Family" = "protocol" in that paragraph].

So - I think a generic ACK can be useful, but will not alleviate the need for Message Family specific implementations of ACKs that understand the context of the protocol being executed.  Both are needed (as you think), I just think message family specific ones will be more important.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 03 Jan 2019 19:35:39 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran I am really, truly trying to understand. But I am still struggling.

There is no question in my mind that knowing what to do with an ACK inside of, say, a payment protocol, will require payment-specific knowledge. But why does that mean I need a payment-specific ACK message? Why can't the generic ack arrive at an agent, and the agent say, "Ah, this is a message that's part of thread X, which is a payment protocol thread. So route the ack to the payment protocol handler."

Are you assuming that all routing/handling will be done on the basis of message family only?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 03 Jan 2019 21:33:51 GMT):<br/>
What I'm saying is since the ACK is going to have to be protocol specific, why not just be explicity about making it part of the protocol?  I think that's less complex.  Not saying it can't be done as you say, just that it is more complex for what I think is the common case.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 03 Jan 2019 22:07:54 GMT):<br/>
I *am* imagining making the generic ACK part of the payment protocol--so the phrase "be explicit about making it part of the protocol" isn't adding up for me. When you define the payment protocol, you say, "At this point in the protocol, you are required to send an ACK." And rather than defining the message type, fields, and processing logic for payment acks, which is likely to be 99.9% identical to how acks work in every other protocol, we just say "It's our old friend the ack message, which was defined in HIPE X." How would redefining the ACK message in every new protocol that needs it be less work?
</p>

And rather than defining the message type, fields, and processing logic for payment acks, which is likely to be 99.9% identical to how acks work in every other protocol, we just say "It's our old friend the ack message, which was defined in HIPE X." How would redefining the ACK message in every new protocol that needs it be less work?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 03 Jan 2019 22:13:01 GMT):<br/>
I think maybe I am not understanding what you mean by "protocol specific". The effect that the ACK has on the state of a given protocol will be protocol-specific. But the content of the message, and the meaning of its fields, would be general, would they not?

@TelegramSam and @swcurran : What would you think about departing from the term "decorator" and using the term "mixin" instead? I have heard Sam use "annotation" many times, and I think that feels very natural as well, because of the "@" that we are putting on the front of field names of this type. But if I get precise about definitions, what we are doing is not really as close to the idea of annotations/decorators as it is to the idea of mixins. A mixin is an alternative to multiple inheritance, where you can give an object properties from some other bundle without inheriting from it. The operative word with a mixin is "include". This is exactly what we are doing with @type, @id, @thread, and so forth. On the other hand, an annotation or decorator is about adding metadata to something. It sort of fits; you could say that what we are adding with @type and @id is metadata. But I am finding that sometimes the fields we add with this mechanism are pretty central to a protocol; they are not guaranteed to be optional and to only be relevant at a different level of analysis from the main data of the message.

And if you go for the "mixin" notion, what do you think about using "+" instead of "@" as the prefix char? My reasoning on this is that "+" communicates mixin-ness nicely, but also that this has the happy consequence of avoiding the collision with JSON-LD @ notation.

I think mixin implies that `@attributes` are an extensible pattern, and that (so far) has not been the intent. I still lean to decorator (though my cold-addled brain did say annotation multiple times on the last agent call...)
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 15:07:13 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam Can you say more about "extensible pattern"? If that had been our extent, what would we observe? Would it be that we expect many people to write custom mixins?
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 15:11:29 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman Yes. I believe decorators should be reserved for elements widely adopted within the community. 
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 15:12:21 GMT):<br/>
Mixins imply that developers should be comfortable developing their own for convenience.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 22:08:02 GMT):<br/>
How about we go back to the definitions of these - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern.  It all comes done to patterns :-).  A third way of looking at it would be https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming, but I think that is more limited to what we are doing with decorators (as we currently call them).
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 22:08:20 GMT):<br/>
Based on these descriptions, I think "decorator" is the most accurate and we should keep it.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 22:10:56 GMT):<br/>
And to use this to drive home another preference - I'd really like to have decorator specifications to be versioned - e.g. to handle the specification of a decorator to look exactly the same as a message family.  That implies a DID-based name space, and (at least) a decorator version and type.  The name-space allows for creation of decorators built by others, along with the "core" set of decorators.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 22:12:39 GMT):<br/>
Why I think we are talking about decorators (but could be totally wrong):

```
What problems can the Decorator design pattern solve? [4]

Responsibilities should be added to (and removed from) an object dynamically at run-time.
A flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality should be provided.
```
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 22:16:33 GMT):<br/>
BTW - one other thought on this.  I think "thread" should not be a decorator, but a core part of the message.  That means that it would be defined here - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0021-message-types  as required to be supported in all messages.  This implies that `@id` becomes a required field in every message, which I suspect is a very slight de-optimization.  There will be very few messages that don't have at least an `@id`, if not a full thread structure.

</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 22:32:29 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran I agree with your last point, at a very minimum there should be a clear requirement for the `@id` decorator in a message as threading and error handling effectively relies on its presence. 
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Sat, 05 Jan 2019 14:37:27 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran In my mind, decorators are in effect designating core parts of messages.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Sat, 05 Jan 2019 14:38:26 GMT):<br/>
On versioning Decorators: I'd love to, but have been unable to come up with a way of doing so that is worth the added complexity.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Sat, 05 Jan 2019 14:39:53 GMT):<br/>
Also on decorators: I think we bleeding from "Super commonly supported message attributes" (which I believe was the original intent) to "subclassing and extending message types" which I believe is the wrong move.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 07 Jan 2019 17:38:12 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran It is interesting that you would link to the wikipedia articles and then conclude that this is an argument in favor of decorators. I read the wikipedia article on mixins and thought *that* was exactly what we are doing. :-) But after some pondering, I see where your head is at, and I think your perspective is clearer than mine was.

It seems to me that the difference between mixin and decorator boils down to whether we are modifying a class as a whole (all instances), or ad-hoc modifying a single instance of a class. If the former, we're following the mixin pattern. If the latter, we're following the decorator pattern.

We've been doing both. In some HIPEs, we're requiring a certain "decorator" to be present in every instance of the class. But we've also talked about adding decorators to individual instances of a class in ad-hoc fashion. So although we could use "mixin" to describe part of what we're doing, I think we could use "decorator" to describe all of what we're doing. So that's a very long way of explaining why I'm comfortable keeping "decorator" and abandoning my "mixin" suggestion... You convinced me. :-)


</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 07 Jan 2019 17:39:27 GMT):<br/>
I agree with @TelegramSam that versioning decorators is a can of worms. I'd rather do it the hard way (@thread2 someday, instead of @thread) than try to do it a standard way that introduces a lot of complexity.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 07 Jan 2019 17:48:19 GMT):<br/>
One of the problems we're trying to solve here is adding functionality (fields/structure) to a message type without redefining it over and over again, and without resorting to the metaphor of inheritance (which IMO has some nasty baggage we don't want). That's the mixin use case; it allows us to say that a message type "includes" a chunk of structure without "inheriting" it.

Another problem we're trying to solve is adding functionality to a message *instance*, as when we include some localization info or an ad hock ACK request on a given message. This is the decorator use case.

A third problem we're trying to solve is to add fragments of semantics/metadata to things that are NOT messages. The localization HIPE mentions several possible scopes like this, including a message family, a thread, a connection, etc. It's not clear to me how much we care about this third problem, but I bring it up because it's interesting and it pushes the limits of both the mixin and decorator pattern definitions.

If we wanted to be pure, we could call our mechanism the "X" mechanism, and say that X manifests as mixins when we alter the content of a message type, definitionally--and manifests as decorators when we alter the content of a message instance, ad hoc fashion. And maybe X manifests as other ways in other scopes.

But I'm also content to just call this mechanism decorators, for simplicity.

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 07 Jan 2019 17:49:57 GMT):<br/>
BTW, Evernym is planning to use the A2A mechanism for internal communications inside its agency, and is planning to "decorate" messages with some information that the agency will need to manage security and message trust contexts well. I bring this up because @TelegramSam wondered whether this mechanism would be used for non-interoperable, non-general stuff.

@swcurran : Re your assertion that @id and maybe @thread should be required on all messages, I think we might be generalizing too soon. Could it be that the reason we are seeing threading as a universal pattern is that all the messages we have imagined *interaction* oriented? If we did something like multicast or broadcast (e.g., streaming sensor data from an agent that can't listen, only talks), would we still want them? I'm kind of iffy. Maybe. It would allow a receiver to talk about a specific message--just not with the sender. Maybe that case is so marginal that we should generalize anyway?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 22:28:58 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman I don't think so.  Since we've declared A2A to be async, the **vast** majority of messages will be at minimum request/response messages - interactions as you point out. In the (to this point only imagined) case of a uni-directional/no response/no error handling message, I would think an implementation could happily insert a really short number/string for the @id value to meet the letter of the standard, if not the spirit.  I vote we generalize away :-).
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 22:46:56 GMT):<br/>
I'd like some clarifications around decorators, and I believe @swcurran has mentioned this before. Do we believe that some decorators are going to be required (e.g. @type and @thread) where as some will be optional (@sig)? If so do we want to treat these in the same way where we generalize them to assume if they're required or optional that they should support all message families?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 22:50:45 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog - my suggestion is that those that we believe are required, we move out of "decorator" status and into core. @id/@thread is (I think) the only one that fits that category.  @danielhardman has already put into the "Decorators" HIPE a list of the "accepted/proposed" decorators and pointers to their specs, and I think that makes sense and should be continued. 
</p>

anything that isn't likely to be broadly applicable across message families shoulnd't (in my mind) be a decorator.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 22:54:04 GMT):<br/>
I disagree on @id/@thread.  Another categorization that might be helpful are decorators that are intended to be cross-cutting and handled by the Agent Message Dispatcher (tracking, timing), and those that are likely to be handled by individual message families (e.g. @sig, @request_ack, @localization).

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 22:57:39 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 23:10:38 GMT):<br/>
I thought that the @ was to indicate there was something special about the field - either core or a decorator, and decorator implied optional.  
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 23:11:11 GMT):<br/>
I think that's a good definition - and hence my push on @id should be required and messages should be rejected if they don't have that.

</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 23:12:05 GMT):<br/>
the original idea behind the @ was that @ed attributes were reserved.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 23:12:35 GMT):<br/>
decorator _does_ apply well to the `@110n` stuff, but not to type and id.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 23:13:23 GMT):<br/>
I'm pretty against @thread being explicitly required. The threading HIPE states what it should implicitly be if absent, and I think that's sufficient.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 23:14:27 GMT):<br/>

I'm also against @thread being required, but I'm pretty comfortable with @id being required. If we announce that, then I think we need to describe decorators differently. This could be done by some changes to the verbiage of the decorator HIPE.

How do you feel about this explanation of @:
Fields without @ are problem-domain-specific. That is, if they appear in messages for playing tictactoe, they have a meaning specific to tictactoe. If they appear in messages for credential exchange, they have some semantics tied to credential exchange.
On the other hand, fields with @ are not problem-domain-specific. They address general communication issues. They still might be optional or required--but regardless, they deal with cross-cutting communication-related issues, not the problem domain of the message.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 23:21:10 GMT):<br/>
(BTW, I am more and more feeling like I want to use + as the prefix char, not @. It has to do with some evolving thinking I've had around JSON-LD compatibility. I'm saving that for a separate day, though.)
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 23:23:24 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 23:45:07 GMT):<br/>
As I review it though, I still differ on whether a thing requires a DID. While it does fit the spec to apply DIDs to things, I differ on it's application because I believe there's other specifications that better tailor to identifying objects which are incapable of making decisions AND never will. This distinction leads me to believe that because the cryptographic property is unused, that the usecase would better fit a UUID.  To better understand your reasoning though, what unique characteristics of a DID exist over UUIDs that make them better suited to represent inanimate objects which will never autonomously perform an action?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 23:49:09 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog Be careful about the use of the word "thing". Michael is advocating a definition that's quite different from the one in the Sovrin glossary. In Michael's parlance, "thing" is by definition inert. In Sovrin's parlance, "thing" can include IoT things. Michael would call those "actors", not "things". Michael's parlance comes from Archimate. (Correct me if I'm wrong here, @mwherman2000 ).

I'm not advocating anything particular here, either about definitions or about how we analyze the problem. I'm just pointing out the subtlety so everybody knows to parse words carefully.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 23:51:55 GMT):<br/>
I believe I'm thinking of Thing correctly then. Something like an asteroid would fall under a Thing in his definition, whereas something like an IoT device (which needs a decision tree to perform a set of actions) which has an actor representing it, would remain an actor with another actor haviing guardianship over the IoT device.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=wrZW8FH7NRf7kfJbW) @swcurran Actually, I think it sort of does. Signing a particular piece of content is not a domain-specific mechanism; it's a generally useful mechanism that applies to all sorts of scopes in all sorts of messages. Hence, field.@sig. Communicating locale info is a little harder to argue, but you could explain it like this: The phenomenon of localization crops up over and over in all kinds of messages, at all kinds of level of detail. It may have some relationship to specific domain-specific fields, but as a phenomenon, it's not domain-specific.

I might like it more because it confirms my other prejudice, that this is really a mixin rather than a decorator. :-) I'm content to let it simmer--and in the overall scheme of things, if we use a char other than my favorite one, I won't argue much.

</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 00:01:06 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman  @TelegramSam I think the biggest difficulty around which ever we select is going to be finding suitable JSON parsers as well as knowing what languages support for variable declaration. For example in rust, the JSON parser does support translations from `thread` to `+thread` built into the seralizer, but I couldn't declare a variable in a struct +thread.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 00:01:45 GMT):<br/>
Right. But you couldn't decleare a variable in a struct @thread either, could you?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=wcMEijkQzBxPG2FAg) @mwherman2000 I don't feel like this definition suffices for the nuance I was trying to extract. While being legally accountable vs not is important, in my opinion whether or not a `thing` has a supporting decision tree and can process logic is the nuance that I find important. For example, a digital object can support processing logic, but a natural object could not.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 00:04:03 GMT):<br/>
@mwherman2000 : Using the definition of thing that you quoted, a "thing" in Sovrin can include items that take action on their own. Am I incorrect that your "thing" disallows that?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 00:04:15 GMT):<br/>
What I am suggesting is that your "thing" is a subset of Sovrin's "thing"
</p>
<p><strong>mwherman2000</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 00:04:57 GMT):<br/>
The Sovrin defintion isn't perfect.  I class Actors as: People, Organizations, and Software Agents.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=J4zjZP3d9RgDdfJqu) @danielhardman Correct. With regards to rust, we do the same trick with the `@` symbol as we would with `+` I haven't investigated if this holds true for other languages. In particular, I'd want to dig deeper into how other JSON serializers handle this. Particularly Python and JS because the JSON parsers are integrated as standard packages.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 00:06:03 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 00:16:36 GMT):<br/>
Ok I believe I understand the difference between a Thing and an Actor. Let me try repeating to make sure I understand your terminology. An actor is an entity which is capable of performing a behavior while a thing is an entity which is incapable of performing a behavior on it's own behalf. Rather an Actor which possesses some form of property rights over a thing must perform a behavior on behalf of said thing.
</p>
<p><strong>mwherman2000</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 00:18:01 GMT):<br/>
AI is not an Actor according ArchiMate ...that a misquote from somewhere.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 00:18:24 GMT):<br/>
how can it not be an actor when "it is a business entity capable of performing a behavior"?
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>mwherman2000</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 00:19:34 GMT):<br/>

AI is not a business entity.

</p>
<p><strong>mwherman2000</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 00:20:08 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>mwherman2000</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 00:24:38 GMT):<br/>
```
1.  The Business Layer depicts business services offered to customers, which are realized in the organization by business processes performed by business actors.

2.  The Application Layer depicts application services that support the business, and the applications that realize them.

3.  The Technology Layer depicts technology services such as processing, storage, and communication services needed to run the applications, and the computer and communication hardware and system software that realize those services. Physical elements are added for modeling physical equipment, materials, and distribution networks to this layer.

I needed to scroll back to find the spark that set off this discussion :-) ... here it is `This distinction leads me to believe that because the cryptographic property is unused, that the usecase would better fit a UUID. To better understand your reasoning though, what unique characteristics of a DID exist over UUIDs that make them better suited to represent inanimate objects which will never autonomously perform an action?`

<p><strong>mwherman2000</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 00:51:02 GMT):<br/>
Again, my raison d'etre for wanting to use DID Entities to represent Things is that what I really want to represent is Non-Fungible Entities (aka Somethings aka Actors and Things) ...and I want some sort of signed, trusted, irrefutable, etc. representation/framework/specification for NFEs/Somethings/Actors/Things ...this is why #iDIDit in the first place. :-)

<p><strong>mwherman2000</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 00:54:21 GMT):<br/>
As suggested by a number of folks (aka People), I dove head-first into the draft DID specification ...found a few dozen issues ...ok, actually 3 dozen issues.  Now I'm working to roll those to find a small number of root cause issues that are easier to discuss and solve (vs. the 36 very detailed issues).  That's why and where I'm at.

First up, what you perceive to be a stable message type can become a "Message Base". `@id` might be burnt into the metadata block of those objects. Anything that is _fairly_ common across message types can be stored in the main body of the Message Base rather than residing in the metadata block. A subset overlay can be used to restrict certain components in the main body of the Message Base. For example, if `@thread` is not required 100% of the time, you could use a subset overlay to omit that component. A subset overlay basically acts as a 'keep' statement rather than a "Drop" statement. Using the Overlays architecture, your Message Bases should remain stable per message type. Any nuances, coloration, tweaks, etc. can be resolved using Overlays.

@pknowles Here is an example of a simple request/response message pair with all properties present. Some, you will notice, have names beginning with "@". These are what we call "decorators". Others are simple fields that have a meaning specific to the problem domain of feature discovery (what this HIPE is about). https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/127a3a8e372b99d94ccbefc9d44f82ef3c75ef50/text/feature-discovery/README.md#messages

you'll need to request a new claim from the issuer.

Hi all. I have worked many weeks with `indy-sdk`, I have developped a POC to enforse DID creation, credentials generation, proof sharing, ... I have a little contributing on `indy-sdk` (samples and how-tos script for NodeJs). Now I take a look at `https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent`. I'm a little surprised. I was expecting to find some new concepts and new tools, in higher level than SDK, but it seems to be just like a demonstration, showing the use of SDK, adding HTTP communication between actors to exchange some data, .... but not really a library or tools that I can use for my application (in my mind, in place of low level operations with SDK). Could you confirm ? Or is there somewhere else some ready to use tools for the agent function ? Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>firewater</strong> (Fri, 11 Jan 2019 19:16:58 GMT):<br/>
what is the diff between and schema and creddef? 
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Fri, 11 Jan 2019 20:39:09 GMT):<br/>
@xnopre You are correct, indy-sdk is more of a lower level SDK that exposes the low level tools required to build agents, the next abstraction up is VCX https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/vcx that may be what you are looking for? Essentially VCX is a higher level SDK that comes with a credential exchange protocol among other features built in. There are other efforts ongoing showcasing agents such as https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent which is reference indy agent and https://github.com/streetcred-id/agent-framework which is a C# version of libVCX that works in a slightly different way.

Welcome @xnopre!
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 11 Jan 2019 22:22:26 GMT):<br/>
Now that the SDK has most of the key functionality, the agent work is becoming an area of focus. Vendors like Evernym (my employer) and organizations like the Sovrin Found, BYU, and BC.gov have implementations of agents. Our joint focus has been in agreeing to the standards for communication (visible in the indy-hipe repo), and starting a compatibility test suite. @TelegramSam has been leading an effort to build a Python reference agent.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 11 Jan 2019 22:22:59 GMT):<br/>

I wanted to raise a topic that I've heard @swcurran and @tplooker alude to, and make a comment about it. It is the idea that the wire level messages may be able to short-circuit the need for a forward message type, either always or sometimes, and also eliminate the need for DIDs at that routing level, because the packaging done by @kdenhartog in pack/unpack can reveal the key of the destination. Thus, we could route by keys, not by DIDs, and we don't have to do wrapping and unwrapping; each intermediary can simply inspect the packaging and say, "Nope, not me. I'll forward to the next guy."

I may be summarizing the idea badly, but that's the gist of what I understood from brief comments about it on an agent call. Did I understand the concept?

If so, here are some thoughts about it. (If I misunderstood the idea, please disregard.)

Although this looks like a nice optimization (and indeed I get why it would save some overhead and simplify some things), I think we should not only not consider this, we should explicitly disallow it. If the packaging in a wire message discloses the key for anyone other than the immediate next recipient, we should agree that all agents should delete the message and refuse to cooperate in forward it.

Here's why.

1. This destroys privacy. Under a method where a forward message must be used to wrap each hop, the only thing that is every known by any given hop is who to send to next. Under the alternative proposal, everybody along the chain knows where messages are going to end up, and at least part of where they came from.

2. It creates an artificial distinction between the behavior of routing and all other protocols that agents deal in. When we have a forward message, forwarding is just another protocol. It doesn't have any special meaning to any intermediary. You get a forward message that you can decrypt; you do the decryption and see that it's a forward request, and if you support that protocol, you service the request. Under the alternative, routing is a very distinct behavior from processing agent messages. I think this violates the DRY principle and creates unnecessary complexity and maintenance burden.

3. It requires too much knowledge by intermediaries. If Alice sends to Bob, every hop has to know how to get to the final destination (and, as I noted in my privacy point #1, every hop gets to record the final destination), whereas under a regime that uses forward messages, only the sender needs to figure out a viable route. Since only the sender should have a need to know that Bob is using a mediator and a routing agent and that Bob is the destination, keeping this concern with the sender feels appropriate.

Perhaps there are variations on this idea, or nuances to it, that are worth discussing? I haven't thought all that through; just wanted to throw out a reaction to get a conversation started...

@danielhardman - your first point is definitely not what we are proposing - far from it. The routing would continue to operate hop by hop on an as needed basis. The Agent routing a messages sees no more than what they see in the "to" field of the forward.  No additional information is being exposed.  We are just noting that we think the verkey in a pack()'d message and the "to" field are always going to be the same.

On the second point, you are welcome to have an "Forward" protocol if you want.  I just don't think you need it, since this new way of doing pack() makes the point of forward redundant. Per previous point, the pack'd message in the forward already contains the necessary routing information.

On point three - I think you misunderstand the idea.  There is no pack()'ing the full path.  The pack() operations are exactly the same as is done as described in the Cross-Domain HIPE.

I'll try to get something written over the weekend that clarifies how this would work.  It may not work, but it definitely wasn't intended to work as you are thinking.  I'm pretty sure it's a drop-in replacement for what we already plan to do.

<p><strong>xnopre</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 16:12:28 GMT):<br/>
Looking at `indy-agent`, there are 1 process for each user, each process has its own HTTP port. In real life (= in my future solution), what is the idea for architecture ? I think I will not start as many processes as users... Isn't it ? I imagine that I will have only one process for all users, with different URLs for the (dynamic) endpoints of each user ? Perhaps something like this `https://my-agent-server.com/{DID_of_user}` ? Or perhaps a more anonymous URL with a random hash (`https://my-agent-server.com/{random_hash_for_each_user}`) if it is a bad idea to have the DID in the URL. What are the good ideas or good ways ? Where can I possibly find some documentation or explanations ? Thanks !! :-) 
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Mon, 14 Jan 2019 16:22:30 GMT):<br/>
A very simple way to fix this would be, as you said, separate agent URL for each user. You can generate a Guid or Hash and associate that with a specific wallet. This is not a great approach as it is vulnerable to correlation. A better approach would be to use single URL for all users/wallets, and add routing associations, where each user associates destinations with their wallet. The central agent then reads every incoming message, checks the destination, resolves the routing table and forward the message to the appropriate wallet/user/process/queue, etc.
 There are standardization HIPE's that discuss possible routing standards if you're looking for specific implementation - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/75

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=t4XzeDBF2hhKCkw2G) @danielhardman With regards to the privacy aspects, I don't think this is broken because a Wire Message could wrap another wire message. Given that the forward message content is just a base64 encoded wire message the recipient would see the same data as they would using a forward message from what I can tell. This leads me to believe that number 1 and 3 won't be a problem based on what I know.

I agree with your point about number 2 giving special meaning for routing, but I'm not sold on the additional complexity aspects yet. I'll have to think about this more. To support your argument, I do believe removing the forward message will remove any sort of richness that may come from routing based on DIDs rather than keys, but I'm not certain that it's a profound difference. I think where using DID based routing (with forward messages) rather than key based routing (with only wire messages) would be when a key has been rotated and hops have been notified, but the sender was not.

In this case,

I think where using DID based routing (with forward messages) rather than key based routing (with only wire messages) would be when a key has been rotated and hops have been notified, but the sender was not. In this case, we'd have a failed route because the intermediary hop might not have a way to resolve the key to an endpoint. A DID wouldn't be rotated though, and therefore wouldn't encounter this issue.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 15 Jan 2019 01:09:44 GMT):<br/>
@xnopre What @tomislav described is good practice for external exposure. Internally to an agency, however, you may wish to employ those types of processes for internal routing and sharding requests/agents across servers.

It is important to recognize that the python reference agent in indy-agent is designed for readability and completeness, NOT for scale. Anybody running agents as a service (what we call agencies) will need to make a good number of architectural changes to run agents efficiently.
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Tue, 15 Jan 2019 01:36:09 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog I agree with your observation around the added complexity when routing via keys instead of DID's however I do think there is a version that prevents the above problem. Say I want to rotate a key for my connection with alice, first I generate a new key, then asking my routing agent to create a route for this new key, on confirmation this route is now placed (and messages are deliverable via the new key), I can communicate this updated key to Alice. Sometime later I may remove the route associated to my old key
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 15 Jan 2019 02:17:27 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, seems like a simple enough solution. I figured it wouldn't be much of a challenge, I was mainly trying to challenge my own thinking to see where it might lead. I think it would be ok to remove the forward message at this point.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Tue, 15 Jan 2019 03:49:28 GMT):<br/>
If the message to be forwarded is still embedded in a new wire level message, then all we avoid is one layer of very simple message. Seems like a small gain for a huge architectural loss. I'll wait for the full writeup though.

@dbluhm @TelegramSam I just tried to run the python section of `indy-agent`. I'm on MacOS. I tried to follow the README "using docker". I have some problems :
1/ Each screen start asking for "Wallet credentials". I fill with "Alice / 1234" or "Bob / 1234", but nothing happens when clicking "Open and Create", except than the name (Alice or Bob) appear on top right. I can click on "Connections" and see the 2 empty tables, but if I refresh the browser, I go back to "Wallet credentials" screen... :-/ ... But it's all OK if I start the program with `--wallet Alice 1234` or `--wallet Bob 1234`: in this case, no "login" page, the browser go to "Connections" page
2/ I'm using Docker on MacOS. So I can access to the WEB pages with `http://localhost:<port>/`. I can find the "internal" docker IP addresses or each container (i.e. `172.17.0.3` for example). But with Docker on MacOS it is not possible to access the container with this IP address. No problem, the WEB pages are OK. But, the processes are not able to connect between them with `localhost`, only with internal docker IP addresses. So, in Alice page, I can send a connection request entering the Bob's endpoint with internal address (`http://172.17.0.3:8095/offer`), the request is well sent to Bob. But the endpoint of Alice in this request is automatically generated by Alice agent as 'http://localhost:8094/offer`, and it doesn't work as explained previously, Bob agent is not able to send message to Alice with this endpoint. I have found a solution, in `admin.py`, getting local IP address with `socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())` and using it to generate `agent.endpoint` and `agent.offer_endpoint`. With this correction, all the process (scenario of the demo) is OK. Do you think that this correction is OK without docker ? Are you interested with a Pull Request with this correction ?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=qRc3rw5ZfRZWZrRBD) @tomislav json-ld has some excellent properties, but has lots of.... well.... baggage that comes along with using it. Changing from our current designs make some of our requirements difficult to adopt. Being json-ld non-conflicting means that we have the option in the future to move that direction should we choose. It could also be added by somebody dediated in the interum without causing issues.

Having a mechanical definition of message types would be good (though not schema.org/Message based, shudder) but we have not yet moved there.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=TqXCwrsfcoFvCfRpn) @mwherman2000 multiple decorators in a single attribute has not been discussed, and I don't believe URL use is a requirement, though it would be convenient.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=iNaut6tQASyJxDuXr) @TelegramSam My two cents worth would be to not enable multiple decorators in a single attribute. The more flexible approach would be to layer decorators and link them through identifiers. If you were to allow multiple decorators within a single attribute, you basically limit any interoperability between objects contained within the layered endpoint message.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 16 Jan 2019 17:45:06 GMT):<br/>
@mwherman2000 I agree with @TelegramSam that we haven't discussed the question of recursion before. There *is* the notion of nested agent messages, each of which could have decorators inside it--so you could have decorators at many different levels. I guess that's a form of recursion. But I don't know that we've encountered a semantic goal that would require decorating a decorator directly. It's an interesting thought. If we can avoid recursion, it probably keeps things simpler, but may also constrain semantics a bit...

Using decorators outside of JSON is discussed in the decorator HIPE proposal, but the specific notion of embedding them in URIs is novel--and intriguing.

@danielhardman @TelegramSam RE: "decorator recursion" e.g. `aaa^bbb^ccc^ddd` Caveat: I'm still learning what decorators/decoration is all about.  
1. My idea was more related to Daniel's comment (but different) ...e.g. can there be "decorator"-like things within a (parent) decorator? ...i.e. the recursion thought was really about _recursive selection_ ...similar I think to where Daniel was headed but I think he was talking about recursive selection nested within messages ...a macro scope.  I was thinking about decorators-within-decorators (a micro scope) without knowing if that even makes sense.
2. The URL question is an important one for any specification-based decisions that are expected to be long-lived (e.g. 100 years).

I'm looking at "agent" concept, reading documents and code, but I don't really understand which data will be stored in the "edge" or "cloud" agent ? For example, if user's credentials are stored in the wallet associated with the edge agent, on the smartphone of the user, they will not be available if the smartphone is off (or offline). If I good understand, the solution is around the "cloud" agent. Is the idea to store the user's credential in the wallet associated with the cloud agent ? In this case, the cloud agent is probably a WEB service, for example provided by my platform, and this service is managing many users, am I right ? But in this cas, this WEB service has to store keys to open and access wallet for each user, isn't it ? But this can be a vulnarable "honey pot" ? .... Where can I find more information to find answer for this questions ? And perhaps some schema or diagram to illustrate solution ? Thanks :-)

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 21 Jan 2019 15:18:20 GMT):<br/>
@xnopre the doc linked by @haggs is good, but deep and a little unorganized. The core concept is that a user's keys would remain on their edge agent, and the cloud agent would only retain keys for those actions allowed them. In many cases, this will be minimal and they will only store messages for later retrieval by the edge agent. In some cases (like the cloud agent for an enterprise) they may have more power delegated to them and will hold more keys in the cloud wallet.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=Cs2LD9fxMjfcZamH3) The part (of many, many parts) that might need clarifying is the "power delegated" for me.  Power could extend from acting entirely on behalf of an identity owner (with a set of keys and described powers for...message types? The recent admin message family comes to mind) or in the case of a simple email relay like discussed last week in the agent call, this could simply be the power to "share DID or URL endpoints across agents"? Please correct me where I might be thinking down the wrong path

Wonder if anyone has been throwing the idea around of wallet or agent trust. I've been thinking that certain issuers and verifiers may want proof that an agent/wallet is suitably protected before entrusting in a proof / issuing a credential. For example the Government may wish to say they only want to issue passports into wallets that have sufficient security mechanisms enabled. A verifier receiving a proof of a passport may also want to verify that the wallet is strongly protected and someone hasn't just picked up another persons phone and disclosed information on their behalf. Just an idea at this stage, wondering if anyone else has been thinking along those lines?

@tplooker and @mwherman2000 I have thought about this issue, but from a different use case perspective. I was thinking that if I were doing business with a given remote party, I might want to only accept their signature on legal contracts if that signature came from a key protected by biomatrics. In other words, I'd be unwilling to accept a signature that came from something that could be automated. I hadn't thought about your use case--only issue a credential or share a proof if the remote party has a wallet with particular characteristics. That use case feels more iffy to me, because there's no way of knowing what somebody does with a proof; it might not go into a wallet at all, no matter how strong a wallet the remote party possesses...

I also ran into this requirement when exploring refugee use cases. iRespond is working on Rohingya situations in Myanmar, and they want to guarantee that an aid worker cannot act as guardian for a refugee child and impersonate them to get foot and such. Thus, they want to allow an aid worker to be a limited form of guardian that can only proceed if there is also a key tied to a biometric for the identity owner. They went one step further, and suggested that the biometric needed to have a freshness criterion--the aid worker has to have used the child's biometrics to generate a countersigning key within the past X minutes.

I also ran into this requirement when exploring refugee use cases. iRespond is working on Rohingya situations in Myanmar, and they want to guarantee that an aid worker cannot act as guardian for a refugee child and impersonate them to get food and services. Thus, they want to allow an aid worker to be a limited form of guardian that can only proceed if there is also a key tied to a biometric for the identity owner. They went one step further, and suggested that the biometric needed to have a freshness criterion--the aid worker has to have used the child's biometrics to generate a countersigning key within the past X minutes.

One way to represent this info would be to self-attest it when naming keys in a DID document. Alice says, "this key is tied to a biometric; that key is not".

One way to represent this info would be to self-attest it when naming keys in a DID document. Alice says, "This key of mine is tied to a biometric; that key is not. This key is stored in a secure enclave; that one is not." This opens up the possibility of fingerprinting someone by the characterstics of their keys, and self attestation may not be reliable enough.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 01:01:29 GMT):<br/>
We could certainly express key/signing requirements in a proof request, but we wouldn't have any way to test them in a pure peer interaction.

What we *could* do is introduce an intermediary that attests to the nature of a given key. For example, a biometric service could attest that a key is tied to a biometric, and that the biometric has been reverified as recently as X minutes ago. Of course, this undermines privacy and self-sovereignty, so it's of debatable value.

<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 01:10:08 GMT):<br/>
Interesting perspective! Essentially the direction I am coming from is if there are sub-par wallet implementations that dont enforce wallet protection strategies, then they can in effect undermine credential disclosure. We could push it back to a wallet vendor credential however this does cause unwanted disclosure of information
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 01:11:21 GMT):<br/>
By pushing the trust back to the implementer of the wallet/agent technology we circumvent this to a degree
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 01:11:48 GMT):<br/>
I.e if you trust the technology vendor then you can have greater trust in the disclosure?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 02:17:01 GMT):<br/>
We may be able to use a Sovrin certified vendor credential to handle this, but even then I could think of ways that a holder COULD (with a lot of wasted energy because it ultimately hurts the holder's security) circumvent this. On the other hand, I'm wondering what the negative implications of this could become. I could see issuers putting some extraneous requirements in place which hurts the sovereignty of individuals. For example, an oppressive regime may say that they'll only issue passports to citizens who use approved wallets (with backdoors built in). 
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 03:09:25 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog Yeah you are absolutley right by identifying the wallet vendor in any form, parties could accept or deny solely based on that information.
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 03:10:23 GMT):<br/>
Wrapping it to a Sovrin issued wallet credential is definitely an improvement but not the perfect solution.
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 06:52:49 GMT):<br/>
Great discussion. These are all considerations we are looking at for DKMS (Decentralized Key Management System), an open standard for SSI wallets that needs to address these core trust issues. Those of us working on DKMS have been thinking that a standard certification of your DKMS wallet (in the form of a verifiable credential of course) could be a part of mainstream DKMS wallet implementations, and the more widely deployed DKMS is, the more that offering ZK proof of such a credential should not have negative privacy characteristics due to herd privacy.
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 15:29:54 GMT):<br/>
Yes .. we would also be interested in this approach of having some sense that the agent a citizen is using when they request their government issued identity credential is "well behaved" ... being able to provide a proof that the wallet has some thrid party accreditation such as sovrin or kantara or DIACC ... something like that .. or even if it comes from known vendors perhaps could be sufficient
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 15:30:21 GMT):<br/>
this will be essential I think for verifiers like banks
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 16:07:28 GMT):<br/>
As I think about it more, while I see that there are negatives that could occur, I'm leaning towards the belief that independent 3rd party auditors (to avoid issues like above) certifying software with credentials would benefit more than hurt.

Another cool way this might be done. We could use a Token Curarated Registry to manage the issuance of these credentials. This would add economic incentive complexity though, so definitely not an MVP type idea.

I saw an earlier version of this doc, but not most of the content that's in it now--so thanks for surfacing it again. Excellent.

I don't think it's smart to frame everything in terms of the test suite; that's the most advanced form of interop. I think it's highly desirable, but I think we need some baby steps before we evaluate test suite compliance.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 23:20:33 GMT):<br/>
That's why I suggested 3 levels of interop, where the first one just begins with us testing plaintext file compatibility, manually.

Interesting thought for plaintext. I wonder if the right applicaiton of that is a non-encrypting test wire protocol, where the needed info is passed in plaintext. That would be easy to write to even on the spot, and swappable later for full wire level support.

So if you have a cloud/hub agent (this agent has its own wallet)  with multiple user wallets, when calling ledger.sign_and_submit_request(), is it safe to have the agent DID (i.e as submitter_did) sign for all users that are submitting a request? 
</p>
<p><strong>Dubh3124</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 05:48:26 GMT):<br/>
For instance, when building a NYM request, I've noticed the submitter did should be the agent DID (or the wallet associated with the agent that has Trust ANCHOR permission). However, when building schema request the submitter DID can be any DID from a wallet.

The indy-agent repo is supposed to have multiple reference agents in it, but I think right now the most mature code it has is for a python-based cloud agent.

There is a reference edge agent as well, called the Sovrin Connector. This is a mobile app for iOS and Android. I don't know where its code is located; perhaps @esplinr or @nage can give us the URL.

Neither of these is the thing I called a "dumb app". The Sovrin Connector is a rich edge agent.

@mwherman2000 I've updated the "How to define a protocol" HIPE in two ways to reflect the learnings that you gave me on BPMN:

1. The "Prior Art" section now begins with a new subsection on BPMN, because I think of all prior art, BPMN's scope of concerns is closest to the problem domain of A2A protocols. I included a link to Camunda, mentioned BPMN's XML file format, and linked to a nice discussion about choreographies. I also suggested that we may want to use BPMN's 

2. I went into the section of the HIPE that talks about state machines and diagrams, and added a discussion about using BPMN choreography diagrams there.

I would be glad of feedback.

@mwherman2000 I've updated the "How to define a protocol" HIPE in two ways to reflect the learnings that you gave me on BPMN:

1. The "Prior Art" section now begins with a new subsection on BPMN, because I think of all prior art, BPMN's scope of concerns is closest to the problem domain of A2A protocols. I included a link to Camunda, mentioned BPMN's XML file format, and linked to a nice discussion about choreographies. I also suggested that we may want to use BPMN's diagrams.

2. I went into the section of the HIPE that talks about state machines and diagrams, and added a discussion about using BPMN choreography diagrams there.

I would be glad of feedback.

@TelegramSam @danielhardman and others: I definitely can't claim to be an expert in this area so take this for what it's worth but does the error reporting mechanism in the revised connection protocol vulnerable to being used in a DDoS attack? For example, someone looks over the ledger pulling down DIDs that likely point to agents of public entities then crafts a connection request that they know will fail but specify an endpoint that is actually the endpoint of a target. The attacker could then send this request to every endpoint it found on the ledger which then all try to send an error report to the targeted endpoint.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=cDsBfdDfK43nGQLBE) @dbluhm It may be possible to perform a DoS amplification attack with the error reporting work which is what you've described. I'd have to look at how people have solved this in the past. I think DNS ran into this problem and was able to come up with a solution.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=QENLvJio9ejYpzGpZ) @DuckLover @DuckLover I'll take a stab but I'm sure more experienced experts in this channel will chime in. I think right now the protocol and exact details for for creating that establishment of connection is a continual effort captured in this HIPE: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/54/.  The reference agent (beautifully done in the video) might be making some assumptions about where the protocol is and will change as the protocol does.  
Most recently the excellent work by @dbluhm and others has probably the best reference to establishment of connection between two agents that could be diagrammed.  Running the reference agent and then viewing the JSON output in your terminal might give you the best reference to put into a visual sequence diagram.  I hope that helps
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 30 Jan 2019 23:55:06 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm My read on it is that parties are not *required* to send error messages, almost ever, in A2A. They are *allowed* to send them at carefully chosen points, with carefully chosen meanings. One of the questions to ask when sending messages is: Can I get the message there? Another is: Should I send this? The latter question should be filtered through a security lens.

We should probably update the problem-report HIPE with a discussion of this topic. I believe there's already a mention in it about this risk.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 00:02:10 GMT):<br/>
Given that we have a connection setup first, I think the primary way this could be used is by sending problem-reports for the connection protocol. Most other situations would be significantly reduced by requiring a connection is already setup to send messages. It would still be possible, but it would be far more theoretical then practical to execute with already setup connections.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 00:16:50 GMT):<br/>
A while ago, I wrote a HIPE about how to request two-way, sync communication over an A2A channel. I then paused the HIPE because I wasn't confident of some of my ideas. I have now done a light update of it, and I think it's now worthy of community review. I don't think we need this right away, but we will be seeing some patterns at the connect-a-thon that will eventually require a mechanism with approximately this feature set. Maybe there are better ways?

@danielhardman great timing, I was going to reach out about this and see where it had got to, will endeavor to squeeze in a review over the next week or so.

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 15:11:07 GMT):<br/>
On the way to working out field based signatures, I ran into questions about the right way to proceed. 
First Option:

```
{
  "@id": "5678876542345",
  "@type": "did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec/connections/1.0/request",
  "label": "Bob",
  "connection": {
    "DID": "B.did@B:A",
    "DIDDoc": {
        // did Doc here.
    }
  }
}
```
On the response, you would sign the 'connection' attribute.

Then, I learned from the DID Spec that the DID MUST be present in a fully resolved did document. This means that we could only use the DIDDoc attribute alone.
Second Option:
```
{
  "@id": "5678876542345",
  "@type": "did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec/connections/1.0/request",
  "label": "Bob",
  "DIDDoc": {
      // did Doc here, which MUST contain a DID to be fully resolved.
  }
}
```
On the response, you would sign the 'DIDDoc' attribute.

This finds conflict with any non-peer DID usage flows. While we will be promoting Peer DIDs within the Indy and Sovrin communities, there are players in the ecosystem that may want to stick with publicly resolvable based DIDs for connections, and we will want a path forward to allow connections if the user is willing to accept those.

Do we allow use of either a DIDDoc _or_ just a DID?
Does the DID need to be signed in the response? (it would if the returned DID was not the same as used in the invitation)
Should we allow this in the request and response message types, or should we have different request and response message types that allow returning the DID alone?

Thoughts?
</p>

@danielhardman @tplooker @nage @swcurran @dbluhm and anybody else ^
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 15:49:55 GMT):<br/>
I've been thinking about this statement: "the DID MUST be present in a fully resolved did document." To me, the answer to Sam's question may depend on whether we should assume that the DID doc we receive is fully resolved. If we sign "connection", then we can tolerate DID Docs that aren't fully resolved. If we sign the DID Doc only, then we can't.

I'm feeling like signing "connection" is better. Doesn't hurt anything to be more flexible...
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 16:03:48 GMT):<br/>
If we sign 'connection' it also makes the DID vs DIDDoc (or an optional DIDDoc rather) cleaner.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 16:04:06 GMT):<br/>
also open to better name for 'connection'.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 16:21:15 GMT):<br/>
First, the @type should be about the semantics of the message not control, so did:sov probably doesn't make sense there.  Second it is *much* better to use credentials or self-signed data separately from a DID Doc, this might make more sense as some type of bundle message so that the data structure for labels and other attributes can be more formally structured (unless connection already has strong typing for a label -- we just want to avoid those types of attributes bleeding into did docs that are stored on immutable registries -- too much correlation leakage)

<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 18:03:37 GMT):<br/>
@nage I don't understand what you are saying. I suspect there is a huge amount of context missing.

Message types ('@type') use a DID as resolution to the type spec, so only control exerted there is by the owner of the DID referenced.

And none of this is stored on an immutable registry... it's an agent message passed from one peer to another.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 18:33:31 GMT):<br/>
My comment is colored by the Schema 2.0 effort and largely ignorant of this weeks discussions in the agent group
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 18:33:49 GMT):<br/>
types are about the meaning of the data regardless of transport, movement or channel
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 18:35:03 GMT):<br/>
so did:sov references only make sense in that the semantics are sourced from a private peer connection, and even in these cases a content-addressable derivation for the id makes more sense, which makes it independent of source.  So pathed references to particular agents probably don't make sense, except as an additional context to reference what agent is considered as the authority over updates or resolving ambiguity
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 19:04:48 GMT):<br/>
The type reference is NOT to an agent, but to a spec service pointer which resolves to a documentation URL. Also, it isn't a did:sov reference, but a DID reference which can use any method.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 19:06:57 GMT):<br/>
that doc reference can be content addressable storage, but that doesn't make sense when documentation updates are required without schema changes. The documentation contains not only the schema of the message, but also includes the other important protocol details releveant to the message family in use.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 19:07:39 GMT):<br/>
I've updated the connection protocol HIPE has been updated per yesterday's agent call conversation about signing attributes instead of signing the entire message: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/a580d00be443990dfcbcf12be5ac85808340de1f/text/connection-protocol/README.md
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 20:43:30 GMT):<br/>
Types are not API routes.  APIs have side effects, forwarding, and other data transformation semantics that are not about the type, and graph path for addressing a particular API or data item is more properly part of an object ID, not the type. 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 21:20:34 GMT):<br/>
@nage I think you are talking about quite a separate topic from the one Sam raised. I am agreeing everything you said but it feels like it doesn't relate to Sam's issue. Might be easier to resolve interactively.

Separate thread: I have raised a new PR with an explainer around agents--what they are, how they work, how they can be categorized, how to write one, etc. This might be a useful resource for new community members who want an introduction to the concept. Something like it has been needed for a while. I suspect other community members can improve it in various ways, so please weigh in. https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/86

Had a good discussion with @TelegramSam today and he helped me understand the requirements issues he is working from.  I think there is still more overlap here, but it won't become apparent until  later, and it isn't worth disrupting the good work going on preparing for the connectathon.   I am satisfied that this issue will come back soon as the Schema work becomes more clear.  Until then I might make some suggestions to rearrange some of how we identify type strings, but not untill we have a clearer way of communicating what value it will add.

- define 3 remotes: "origin" (your fork), "upstream" (hyperledger's copy), and "dhh1128" (my version)
- git fetch dhh1128
- create a new orphan github branch (git checkout --orphan agents)
- on the new branch, git merge dhh1128/agents
- push your changes to origin (your fork)
- on github, click "New Pull Request" button; define the PR so its source is the "agents" branch of your fork, and target is the "agents" branch of my repo

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=b7Jmmj6HR2dGDXQnK) @mwherman2000 i looked into the log and it looks like the agent from alice writes to the ledger directly. I am not sure that it is needed even in the earlier point of development. Shouldnt it normally be that the Faber sends the connection request because it can write to the ledger?
</p>
<p><strong>DuckLover</strong> (Sun, 03 Feb 2019 03:32:53 GMT):<br/>
Is it even possible that Alice creates an connection request without beeing able to write to the leder?

@DuckLover It's super tedious to explain this as chat text.  I've started on the diagram.  It's a fairly tedious protocol - I hope the diagram will help a lot. The diagram will be annotated with the same numbering used for the tasks in the script.  There will be an exact 1:1 correlation between the script code, the script logs, and the diagram. 
Caveat: the `getting_started.py` simulates the details of what an agent-to-agent conversation would look like ...without using actual agents.   The script is one long-hand piece of Python that calls directly into the Indy SDK to make all the calls a group of agents would have to make for the screnario.  It's precise and accurate without having agents implemented as separate communicating/cooperating tasks, for example.

I have one doubt regarding Indy Agents, from what I have learnt, it that agents can be categorized on the basis of location (i.e.: edge or cloud). So if i have a scenario, in which I want the user(holder of creds) to have a mobile app, and interact with the network, can I go with implementing a cloud based agent rather than integrating mobile based (edge agents) in mobile ? If yes, then can you please explain if we have to create a separate agent for all the users or a common cloud based agent can handle wallets of multiple users ?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=X72RxC7cekGS6amh8) @mwherman2000 Thats makes me not sure if i understand DID and DID Document :thinking: By sharing your DID, you give a person/organisation your PublicKey for a secure communication but also an endpoint (like an url) where the agents send their data to. Without providing an endpoint behind the DID how does the agent know where to send data to?
</p>
<p><strong>mwherman2000</strong> (Mon, 04 Feb 2019 14:42:38 GMT):<br/>
At the low(er) level that I'm talking about (below the agent/DID Document level), the agent doesn't have any information about the endpoint ...at this level there are no agents ...but this is at the low-level _plumbing_ level ...i.e. the plumbing doesn't know about pumps and water taps, etc. ...hope the metaphor works.

In my use case, I want to give the user a mobile based application which should be capable to interact with Indy nodes and do the required txns (like issue/request credentials).
From what I have learnt so far is that, we have to create agent application, which interacts with Indy nodes
And we have wrappers available of Indy SDK to create the agent app in different languages.
But I am planning to create mobile app using IONIC framework which can build cross platform native apps for both android and iOS
so wanted to understand whether I would be able to integrate Indy SDK in ionic app or I would have to go with Native app development and use Indy SDK wrapper for Android & iOS?

@HLFPOC Ultimately, you need libindy native binary both for iOS and Android in order to run it. With ionic, you could use a plugin that exposes interfaces to both. I'm not sure if the Nodejs wrapper can be used in the context of embedded web view and call the platform specific API for you, out of the box. If that's the case, then you can use the nodejs wrapper. Connect me app was written in react native, which is of similar architectural setup for both platforms. https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-connector-preview

Do we have any notification/event service available in Indy SDK or at agent level which notifies the user whenever some other user requests/issues some credentials ? As I was going through the Alice-Faber college demo, each time we have to reload the browser to see the updated changes..so just thought it would be beneficial to trigger some notification or event about any new transaction.

Notifications are higher level concepts, not suited for solving at indy-sdk level. In your example, the python agent could implement this using websockets or similar.

@tomislav  Can you please explain more about role of steward in Indy? As per my understanding, it is a bootstrap identity which has the role of Trust Anchor and has ability to add new Trust Anchors in the network. So if i have to create my own private Indy pool and add 3 new orgs in that pool so do I have to enroll 1st Org using steward identity ? If yes, where and how to define the steward seed value and do i have to make separate agent app for steward for creating DID of my organizations ?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=q2AhMBr5YW2i7C6Yg) @HLFPOC You are correct that a steward has the privilege of adding trust anchors. A trustee can also add a trust anchor to the network, I think--and it is possible that a trust anchor can add another trust anchor. The truly unique/necessary thing about a steward is that it can add a node--exactly one node--to the network. In other words, you must be a steward to add a validator.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=GmNRJkJe7hgt9BwAM) @mwherman2000 Yes, we have periodically asked ourselves this question. I think for some audiences this might be quite helpful, and for other audiences it might just muddy the waters. The notion of a connection in A2A maps approximately to layer 5 (session). A2A wire messages maps to layer 6 (presentation). Agent plaintext is layer 7 (application)--but so is our concept of protocols (unless protocols are a missing layer 8).

A2A calls everything below layer 5 "transport", which is a simplification of OSI's layers, but not an incorrect one in that OSI only requires each layer of abstraction to understand the layer immediately beneath it. The wikipedia article about OSI has a very nice table for layer 4 (transport) that explains why A2A (which is transport-agnostic) cannot assume duplex communication pipes with reliable delivery.

Some concepts/terminology from OSI are not going to help us (e.g., "PDU")--even though they are present in our system, adopting the terms just makes the conceptual landscape denser.

I wonder if a one-page write-up of this topic would be valuable--either as an update to our wire HIPE or as a link referenced in it.

@xnopre You're right, can't use nodejs directly. Perhaps https://github.com/janeasystems/nodejs-mobile-cordova can be leveraged. It provides access to nodejs runtime using standard cordova bridge, while nodejs has access to the native libraries. May be worth a shot for those looking in cross platform options.

Guys,
What's the best approach to get published credential definition IDs from another agent?
The scenario is one agent trying to discover the public credential definitions from another DID (agent).

Hi! I was working on Sovrin Test Network. I got a trust anchor created by Sovrin support team and I can store in the ledger schemas by this trust anchor. But if I create a new trust anchor as from the old one, this new trust anchor is not able to store schemas in the ledger. Does someone know why it could be? or what is it happening? 
</p>
<p><strong>DavidP</strong> (Wed, 06 Feb 2019 12:58:57 GMT):<br/>
thanks!!

As a clarification, this is not happening for DIDs, is only for schemas

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=yiXpjfvSYm3AdbEBc) @misaelssantos I think this has to be out of ledger and out of indy, for example, the actor creating schema and cred-def can expose its "catalog" in an HTTP API. Am I right (other guys) ?

Hi all. I'm trying to have a good large vision on "agent", but I don't really understand and I need some top level informations. 
I have read some "hipes" in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text.
I have read this doc (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mRLPOK4VmU9YYdxHJSxgqBp19gNh3fT7Qk4Q069VPY8/edit#heading=h.ody6evg9dhq7) but the last modification was the septembre 7, 2018.
I try to follow the exchanges in this channel, but I don't understand where are the discussions.
I have contributed dockerinzing `indy-agent` and ran it (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent/pull/59).
I have dockerized (I will share it in a PR) the VCX demo, using the `dummy-cloud-agent`.
But even though, I'm lost... :confused:
Questions : Where is the project ? What is the roadmap ? Is there something I can use now, "out of the box" (`indy-agent`, `indy-sdk/vcx/dummy-cloud-agent`, ...), or do I have to implement my own agent ? What is the role of a cloud agent, just to transmit messages between actors, or also storing some data ? I saw some informations for "message format" and "A2A communication", but where are we now, is it finished or still in discussion ? ...
Sorry for as much questions, but I need help to understand... Thanks for some answers for some points :-) 
</p>
<p><strong>DavidP</strong> (Wed, 06 Feb 2019 14:45:54 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @xnopre 
In the Sovrin Trust Framework, I found:
    Trust Anchor.  An Identity Owner who may serve as a starting point in the Sovrin Web of Trust. 
    A Trust Anchor has two unique privileges: 
    1) to add new Identity Owners to the Sovrin Network, and 
    2) to issue Trust Anchor Invitations. 

So I understood that a Trust Anchor could add new Trust Anchors.
I was trying:
    let VerinymDIDRequest = await indy.buildNymRequest('<TrustAnchorDID>', '<NewTrustAnchorDID>', '<NewTrustAnchorVerKey>', null, 'TRUST_ANCHOR');
    await indy.signAndSubmitRequest(poolHandle, '<TrustAnchorWallet>', '<TrustAnchorDID>', VerinymDIDRequest);
But according your comment, only a steward could execute this code.

To sum up, only a steward is able to add new trust_anchor to the network, so if I need to add new trust_anchor to the STN, I have to contact with sovrin support team.

</p>
<p><strong>xnopre</strong> (Wed, 06 Feb 2019 15:09:21 GMT):<br/>
In my understand, yes, only stewards can set "trust anchor" role. Anyone to confirm or not ? 
But you already got a trust anchor created by Sovrin support team, no ?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=b6mTfgTWvXdQQrda8) @xnopre Ah, the big questions!  :-).  To put it simply, all the building blocks are in place and the higher level pieces are being built.  The underlying ledger and SDK are in place, work and have even been used in production. You can build agents, and connect them together, establish connections, issue, hold, provie and revoke credentials, and the crypto is in place.

The current phase of structuring the pieces so that each implementation will work together, and will do so in a privacy-preserving way.  Getting your two agents to talk is easy - getting all implementations to work is harder.

And it is an open source project, so people are building both what the community needs and what they need.

The upcoming connectathon is a key milestone where we hope the different implementations really come together.

Hope that helps.

ALL: I am second-guessing our notion of having a DID reference as a way to identify message types. We need a way to identify something that's immutable--but we already have that with github commit hashes. And our HIPEs are github-centric. I'm wondering of the type of a message ought to be something like: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/6bb006e19836aa42086cd8e48d089bb847f2b31b/text/acks#1.0/ack

I have one doubt regarding Indy Agents, from what I have learnt, it hat agents can be categorized on the basis of location (i.e.: edge or cloud). So if i have a scenario, in which I want the user(holder of creds) to have a mobile app, and interact with the network, can I go with implementing a cloud based agent rather than integrating mobile based (edge agents) in mobile ? If yes, then can you please explain if we have to create a separate agent for all the users or a common cloud based agent can handle wallets of multiple users ? 
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Thu, 07 Feb 2019 08:39:26 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=dmq2zJLosF5tmacqo) @danielhardman That's a very good question. From the standpoint of pure syntax, there's not much difference. From the standpoint of immutability, let me ask a simple question: which do you think is going to be around longer: GitHub or Sovrin? Persistent identifiers are all about the persistent guarantees (or lack thereof). But from a practical perspective (e.g., our lifetimes), either could work. (I personally lean towards the elegance of using DIDs. Also, I'm preparing a proposal that @nage requested for DID syntax to address a digital object permanently stored on a ledger that is NOT a DID document, but rather a "unit of semantics" as he puts it (or he might have said "unit of language").
</p>
<p><strong>xnopre</strong> (Thu, 07 Feb 2019 08:49:24 GMT):<br/>
@DavidP Why do you not "play" with a local sovrin network ? There are many example ot run 4-nodes network, and generally, you can create a DID with seed `000000000000000000000000Steward1` which has steward role, i.e. can give "trust anchor" role to other DID. You can also do what you want ;-)

Hello,
i currently looking at the reference agent demo where Faber creates and sends the Transcript to Alice. Why does the demo not include a form where the values for the credentials are typed in? Is there a idea behind? Something like that it is better to access those data from a local database or maybe that in the future all values could be pulled from other credentials?

@DuckLover @xnopre The Node Agent was early work that did a good job demonstrating a full set of credential behaviors, but was built prior to establishing standard protocols for the agent interactions.

The Python Agent is newer work and the closest to the current established (and proposed) standards, but currently lacks the depth of credential features of the Node Agent.

This is not ideal, but we are pushing as fast as we can. (Community contributions very welcome.) We expect to have credential features in Python within the next 2 months.

@TelegramSam I remember a while back when we were talking about cross domain messaging on a call with @swcurran you said that the term domain was being used in another context outside of that defined in the cross domain messaging HIPE? Reason I ask is we are currently reviewing/rewriting these HIPE's and just wanted to clarify the nomenclature that should be used? The current definition as it stands is 'Domain - a set of Agents collaborating on behalf of an Identity' this gives rise to terminology such as a 'Domain Endpoint agent'. Anyone else have an opinion on this nomenclature?

@danielhardman interesting, are you suggesting we use this outlined convention in place of just relying on threading and outbound channels? i.e a connection request as an HTTP POST just triggers 202 Accepted and in the background triggers an A2A connection response on a new HTTP POST to the resolved connections endpoint?
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 22:11:59 GMT):<br/>

@tplooker If you are doing it with the new HTTP POST the other direction, then you are doing it the "right" way. That's the way I was hoping people were doing it for the connectathon.

The benefit of this way is that it doesn't require a web server on both sides. Many agents won't have the ability to listen except over a channel they open. We can explore that issue more deeply after the connectathon.

@danielhardman I totally agree and hence why I think your proposal for duplexed communication is important, many agents wont have web servers as you pointed out namely mobile edge agents that even have transient connectivity. Our thinking was in the simplest case to have a mobile edge agents endpoint resolve an cloud hosted inbox service that the mobile edge agent can poll to resolve any un-read messages.
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 22:38:46 GMT):<br/>
The other thing to point out with the above proposal is what happens when a mediator is involved in the sending of a message, where does the resolution of the response originate, does the mediator perform the poll or relay the whole http response of the original request back to the originator?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 22:52:47 GMT):<br/>
Doing duplex through a mediator is going to be tricky. I think it can be done, but not without some careful design and some real implementation effort.

If we standardized a feature like the one I outlined in the google doc, then perhaps all agencies would implement it. This might allow duplex through agencies, which would provide a lot of value. But whether other mediators like routing agents also support it would not be guaranteed, so there might still be many cases where it breaks down.
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 22:59:14 GMT):<br/>
Agreed the implementation could definitely be very complex and requires alot of discussion, Im very keen to discuss this further at the connectathon though and gauge how we as a community assess this functionality as a priority.

```Four key ideas guided Kahn’s thinking and the subsequent development of the networking protocols that were to become the bedrock of the Internet:
• Each distinct network would have to stand on its own and no internal changes could be required of any such network to connect it to the Internet.
• Communications would be on a best effort basis. If a packet didn't make it to the final destination, it would shortly be retransmitted from the source.
• Black boxes would be used to connect the networks (these would later be called gateways and routers). There would be no information retained by the gateways about the individual flows of packets passing through them, thereby keeping them simple and avoiding complicated adaptation and recovery from various failure modes.
• There would be no global control at the operations level.```

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=22SnQXXPeWCe4mSxW) @drummondreed I hate being the dissenting voice all of the time but "the Internet for identity" doesn't make any sense.  At best, it's "Identity for the Internet" but likely more appropriate to say "Internet for the World Wide Web".  
Digital Identity/SSI is built on top of the Internet. The Internet isn't changing. It's not a new "Internet". 
Wikipedia: The Internet (contraction of interconnected network) is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide.
Quotes like the above are confuding to those who don't understand these terms.

Hi all :-) . These days, I have read many HIPEs (1) trying to understand and get a vision, to be able to imagine the "good" architecture for our application. I have many times seen this picture (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/master/text/0023-diddoc-conventions/domains.jpg). When Alice wants to send a message to Bob, I don't really understand the path of this message throw agents, the sequence of hops between agents, with which encryption or not, which message type ("forward" or simple relay), ... And studying this picture, and HIPEs read, I don't really understand what is the role of "domain endpoint". Can someone give me more explanation ? Or where can I find schema and/or explanations ? Thanks
(1) Thanks for the links to @danielhardman , @TelegramSam , @swcurran , and others... :-)

Would this be a correct way to represent indy verkey in JWK format?
```
new JWK([
   'kty' => 'OKP',
   'crv' => 'Ed25519',
   'x'   => '11qYAYKxCrfVS_7TyWQHOg7hcvPapiMlrwIaaPcHURo',
])
```
Assuming `x` is a byte array of the base58 encoded verkey.

Here's an attempt to provide an overview of why the flow might be as we show it in that picture, starting from Bob's side:

- Bob's phones are intermittently online, and he needs a permanent location (agent) to receive and hold messages for him - hence "3". "3" and "6" could be merged - they are just playing different roles - a dumb relay (3) for his mobile devices and an intelligent agent (6) that Bob accesses directly.

- The "domain endpoint" is for privacy. If Bob had a known, published, just-for-Bob endpoint, any messages going across the Internet to that endpoint would be known to be for Bob. Instead, messages for many entities like Bob go to the same endpoint and are then routed based on their verkey. Since Bob and all the entities like Bob have many verkeys for their different relationships, monitoring the traffic into the endpoint does not expose to whom the messages are for.  This is "hiding in a crowd".

- The "domain endpoint" does have to know where to send the incoming message based on the Forward message's "to" field.  That is either the destination DID (as in the existing "DIDDOC Conventions" HIPE) or the verkey of the embedded message (as things seem to be moving). Either way - Alice's agent that is to receive the message has to tell the domain endpoint - "hey, when you see this ID - send it to my agent at <endpoint> encrypted using <verkey, algorithm>"

From Alice's perspective:

- Alice's agent on her phone probably doesn't want to send a message directly to the "domain endpoint", so it just sends it to a cloud agent of Alice's that tracks where domain endpoints are.  Hence the send from "1" to "2".  That's purely optional, and is not required by the interoperability.

Addendum: In that DIDDoc Conventions HIPE, we left the idea that Alice must send the message to the Domain Endpoint, to Bob's Routing Agent and then to Bob's Edge Agent for processing with Bob. In current discussions, we are defining more explicit ways for Bob to tell Alice - "when you send a message to me, here's the path to use".  This is crucial for interoperability.

As well, we have the concept of Relays - hops along the way that Bob knows about and uses, but Alice does not know about.  For example, the problem of interrmitent online access could be handled by a relay that Alice doesn't know about. This is for internal optimization within Bob's collaborating agents, and is not required for interoperability.

Hey guys a random thought, not sure if anyone is thinking along the same lines but it just dawned on me, with all this work going on by nathan to restructure the hyperledger projects perhaps the A2A protocol isn't actually A2A maybe we need to elevate further and say this is really just a DID messaging protocol? After all what constraints are we imposing on this protocol other than dids?
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Tue, 12 Feb 2019 05:39:33 GMT):<br/>

@tplooker and @TelegramSam  I don't understand why we're thinking this isn't agent protocol but rather DID messaging protocol. Agents, not DIDs, are doing the messaging, and agents, not DIDs are the eventual recipients. We don't communicate DID-to-DID, but agent-to-agent. And the protocol requires agent behaviors such as routing to make it work.

Hey everyone, I had some thoughts around test/compliance suites after the discussion and demonstration by @dbluhm today.

I think it will be valuable to have a versioned compliance suite that can be run locally to develop against. The compliance suite could also have some sort of public agent registry to see which agents are currently aligned to which version of every spec.

Part of publishing a change to a message family specification could require adding a test suite and a version bump to the compliance suite. Then the community could see how quickly each agent implementation is keeping up with the changes.

Here is an example compliance suite and registry for XMPP server implementations to illustrate what I'm thinking of: https://compliance.conversations.im (source: https://github.com/iNPUTmice/caas)

What do you all think about modelling the Indy Agent compliance suite in this way?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 13 Feb 2019 22:38:03 GMT):<br/>
We've been talking for a while about having a hosted Sovrin instance of the test suite ("am-i-sovrin-yet.sovrin.org" or something, for example) and issuing credentials to certify compliance but it hasn't advanced much further than talks yet. I think it's a great idea.

Thank you for your answer !! :-) 
I still have questions (sorry in advance for so many questions ;-) ) : 
1/ Alice stores in the blockchain its DIDDOC associated with its DID `A.did@A:B` (specific for the relation with B) or associated with its public "offcial" DID `A.did` ?
2/ Why do the DIDDOC (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0023-diddoc-conventions#diddoc) contain a collection of public keys and endpoints ? Why not only one for the relation `A:B` ? What are all this keys and endpoints ? 
3/ In the schema (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/master/text/0023-diddoc-conventions/domains.jpg), what is "6" ? Is there for example a WEB application (= an edge agent not on mobile but on desktop) ? 
4/ To talk to Bob, what must Alice know ? I suppose `B.did@A:B`, OK. But to which agent or endpoint will she send her messages for Bob ? To the "domain endpoint" or to the "routing endpoint" (I don't understand the difference between this 2 concepts) ? Which path is right : 1->9->4 ? 1->2->9->4 ? 1->2->3->4 ? And is the path from B to A the same (inverse), or a "symmetric" path ?
5/ And where are stored the Alice's data ? Only in "1" (edge mobile agent) ? (it's actually my option) Are other agent only "relay" agent, just able to store messages and follow them when receiver is reachable ? Or are some agent more "intelligent", containing some date (credentials) and able to response to some proof request (for example) ?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 21:48:30 GMT):<br/>
@xnopre - some good questions.  Here's a stab at them:

> 1/ Alice stores in the blockchain its DIDDOC associated with its DID `A.did@A:B` (specific for the relation with 😎 or associated with its public "offcial" DID `A.did` ?

The expectation we are building to is that Alice will not store a DIDDoc for Bob on the blockchain. She will store it in her wallet(s), send it to Bob and he will store it in his.  In the future, only issuers of credentials and entrprises that want a publicly-known DID will put their DIDDocs on the blockchain.

> 2/ Why do the DIDDOC (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0023-diddoc-conventions#diddoc) contain a collection of public keys and endpoints ? Why not only one for the relation `A:B` ? What are all this keys and endpoints ? 

The public keys are for each Agent that Bob wants Alice to know about for their relationship. We don't want Agents to share keys, so if Bob wants Alice to send messages to his different devices/agents, he will add a key for each one.

In the DID Spec, the multiple endpoints are to enable contacting the DID's Controller for different types of services In Agent-to-Agent messaging, our original plan (as seen in that HIPE) is that there would only need to be one service endpoint in the DIDDoc and the different services would be invoked by using different messages. For other reasons, that may change - we're discussing that now in the Agent Working Group.

> 3/ In the schema (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/master/text/0023-diddoc-conventions/domains.jpg), what is "6" ? Is there for example a WEB application (= an edge agent not on mobile but on desktop) ? 

"6" is intended to be an example of an agent that is in the cloud. For example, it might be used to handle messages with a default response. For example, every time a proof request for a certain credential is received, always send back a proof.  There might be a Web Interface that the Bob uses to configure the rules for that Agent.

In the example, it's just to remind people that not all agents have to be mobile.

> 4/ To talk to Bob, what must Alice know ? I suppose `B.did@A:B`, OK. But to which agent or endpoint will she send her messages for Bob ? To the "domain endpoint" or to the "routing endpoint" (I don't understand the difference between this 2 concepts) ? Which path is right : 1->9->4 ? 1->2->9->4 ? 1->2->3->4 ? And is the path from B to A the same (inverse), or a "symmetric" path ?

Your question is the core of why that HIPE was written and continues to be evolved. If Bob has a bunch of agents, each with different keys and purposes how does Alice know how to encrypt the message so that Bob can respond?  The HIPE you are reading only went so far in accomplishing that understanding, and it is still being evolved.  Very little of this has actually been implemented, and it's in the implementation that it will solidify.

I think all the questions you are asking are covered in the HIPE, so I'm just repeating what should be there - my fault if it is not clear. We probably should DM for specific question.

Re: Domain Endpoint vs Routing Agent - the difference is the Owner of those Agents.  the DE is owned by a big cloud provider - e.g. Microsoft or Agents-R-Us. The RA is owned by Bob.  The DE is for many people/enterprise to use so no one can tell exactly who is receiving an incoming message. The DE's only role is to route messages to the intended RA - e.g. Bob in this case. Bob's RA would tell the DE ahead of time "Hey, if you see a message for B.did@A:B, send it to me".  Since the messages are encrypted, the DE can't actually see anything about the message.

The message path is not symetrical. Each identity owner defines how they want messages (incoming and outgoing) routed in their domain.

> 5/ And where are stored the Alice's data ? Only in "1" (edge mobile agent) ? (it's actually my option) Are other agent only "relay" agent, just able to store messages and follow them when receiver is reachable ? Or are some agent more "intelligent", containing some date (credentials) and able to response to some proof request (for example) ?

The challenge with providing a simple answer to that question is people have multiple devices (phones, ipads, laptops) and they want to do things from all of the devices, and we (Agent builders) want to allow them to do that in a way that is safe and secure.  We want to create protocols that make it easy for developers/companies to build agents that are secure and convenient. That's always a tradeoff, and at times that makes things pretty complex.

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 23:14:13 GMT):<br/>
I am feeling more and more positive about @tplooker 's suggestion that we rename "A2A" to make it less strongly tied to the notion of an agent. My earlier pushback in this channel was technical--an agent is going to be involved in making the protocol work, for sure--but I'm realizing that the political value of not using "agent" (an Indy buzzword) might be high, because there are some potential allies that need what we've built but don't want to associate themselves with Indy (which they consider a very specific blockchain). So now I'm thinking about whether we should call this communication mechanism something like "DID-to-DID communication" or "D2D" for short. This might fit naturally into the ledger-agnostic posture of the Hyperledger Envoy project that @nage has begun socializing.

<p><strong>stefan.vogl</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 06:24:54 GMT):<br/>
Hello, I'm rather new to the hyperledger projects. I'm working in a project, that aims to implement an identity eco system based on DIDs and Verifiable Claims / Credentials. 

We would like to have the following kinds of use cases: 
* Registration to an online service (maybe even login) -> prove some defined data to an online service
* Prove something at the point of sale

From an architectural point of view, we would like to have a cloud agent and agency (in the most privacy friendly way, there is) to enable users to have: 
* multiple devices
* backup and recovery
* maybe mechanisms to enable some actions without user interaction

At the moment we are very unsure what protocol to use for Agent 2 Agent communication and messaging. We would like to have a code base, that we can build a prototype on and develop it into a stable production system later on. My understanding is (and that may be completely wrong), that if I use the current indy-agent and indy-sdk implementation, I will have to throw everything away, when the new Hyperledger Envoy (or whatever it will be called) is "finished". Is that correct? Or will there be an "upgrade path" to the new protocol?

Is there anything already implemented in the new protocol, that we can use for our implementation, or is this all completely theoretical?

I would very much appreciate, if you could give me some information, or point me in the right direction, because this is a critical point in our project, and we want to make the right decision. 
</p>

@stefan.vogl The new Envoy project will be born out of Indy Agents, and that history will provide an upgrade path.

Hello, if one agent creates a schema and creddef and send credential definiton to another agent. How can a third agent use this credential definiton in this proof_request? I cant find the Creddef via Tag
</p>
<p><strong>DuckLover</strong> (Sat, 16 Feb 2019 00:08:29 GMT):<br/>
I use the reference agent in nodejs as the base and create a schema and a creddef at the startup. The same spot the GovID is created:
```
async function issueWhsIdCredential() {    
    let schemaName = 'WHS-ID';
    let schemaVersion = '1.0';
    let signatureType = 'CL';
    let whsIdSchema;
    let whsIdSchemaId = `${stewardDid}:2:${schemaName}:${schemaVersion}`;
    

    try {
        whsIdSchema = await indy.issuer.getSchema(whsIdSchemaId);
    } catch(e) {
        [whsIdSchemaId, whsIdSchema] = await sdk.issuerCreateSchema(stewardDid, schemaName, schemaVersion, [
            'name',
            'hochschule',
            'studiengang',
            'matrikelnummer',
        ]);
        await indy.issuer.sendSchema(await indy.pool.get(), stewardWallet, stewardDid, whsIdSchema);
        whsIdSchema = await indy.issuer.getSchema(whsIdSchemaId);
    }

    let whsIdCredDef;
    [whsIdCredDefId, whsIdCredDef] = await sdk.issuerCreateAndStoreCredentialDef(stewardWallet, stewardDid, whsIdSchema, 'WHS-ID', signatureType, '{"support_revocation": false}');
    await indy.issuer.sendCredDef(await indy.pool.get(), stewardWallet, stewardDid, whsIdCredDef);
    console.log("This is the whsIdCredDefId: " + whsIdCredDefId);
    exports.setEndpointDidAttribute('WHS-IDCredDefId', whsIdCredDefId);
}    
``` 
When i am trying to send a cred_offer to alice it cant find the CredDef by the Cred_Def_id even if the id is correct in the follwing function:
```
exports.sendOffer = async function (theirDid, credentialDefinitionId) {
    let credOffer = await sdk.issuerCreateCredentialOffer(await indy.wallet.get(), credentialDefinitionId);
    ...
``` 

It seems like the error happens because the wallets are different but shouldnt every agent have the credDef and should find or where and how does the function search for the creddef?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sat, 16 Feb 2019 01:49:17 GMT):<br/>
@DuckLover A credential definition contains private key data based on the schema. When Creddef is created, the public part of it is written on the ledger. If you send the credDef to another agent, you're really sending the public part of it. A credential is issued by signing it using the definition private data. So you can't just pass around the cred def between agents. Each agent has to create definition for themselves.
When you send an offer to Alice, the next step for Alice would be to create a Credential Request from the offer and send that back. Offer -> Request (signed by Alice) -> Credential (counter signed by Issuer of offer)
</p>
<p><strong>DuckLover</strong> (Sat, 16 Feb 2019 02:28:44 GMT):<br/>
Ahh okay. Thanks for the explanation. So i created now a CredDef for every agent with an id thats starts with their did by using the indy.issuer.createDef function but it seems like when i send a proof_request to another agent the cred_id in the proof_request cant be used or it cant find anything to that. How do i prevent that?
</p>
<p><strong>DuckLover</strong> (Sat, 16 Feb 2019 02:36:18 GMT):<br/>
Why does the reference agent in nodejs sends proof_requests with cred_def_id if it cant by used and every agent has his own as i understand?
```
{
  "name": "WHS-ID",
  "version": "1.0",
  "requested_attributes": {
    "attr1_referent": {
      "name": "hochschule",
      "restrictions": [{"cred_def_id": "XTrEq4danDT5Z4JJtY8ZWM:3:CL:17:WID"}]
    },
    "attr2_referent": {
      "name": "durchschnitt",
      "restrictions": [{"cred_def_id": "Th7MpTaRZVRYnPiabds81Y:3:CL:15:SID"}]
    },
    "attr3_referent": {
      "name": "studiengang",
      "restrictions": [{"cred_def_id": "XTrEq4danDT5Z4JJtY8ZWM:3:CL:17:WID"}]
    }
  },
  "requested_predicates": {}
}
``` 

As i understand this created proof request cannot be parsed on the receivers site without replacing the id with their cred_def_id?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sat, 16 Feb 2019 14:43:13 GMT):<br/>
Not every agent needs a cred_def, only the issuers of credentials. When you issue a credential to alice, she can then process proof requests with cred_def carried in the credential she received

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=hvajnJ8NYhFdmrqET) @tomislav In that case, Ledger also stores only the Public information of cred def issued by Trust anchor. Am I right?  Then how verifier verify the Private info of Cred Def ? Do the verifier will contact the trust Anchor (Issuer) for verification of Private attributes of cred def? I want to know which are Private & public attributes in Cred Def. I guess Self attested Revealed attributes are public for sure. How about Encoded Revealed Attributes are they Public too ? I am guessing Predicates are private. Please let me know is my understanding is correct or not.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=m6iDaoWv9eY8tq4aQ) @ashokkj The ledger only stores the Public key for the issuer in the cred def. The private key and attributes are not on the ledger. The private key is kept in the issuers wallet. The attribute values are known between the issuer and the Prover. The verifier only learns revelaed attribute values from a Prover. Predicates only reveal the range of the numeric attribute like 18< x  <100

Thanks for the reply Mike. from @tomislav conversation I could make out Cred Def contains Public attributes (First Name, Last Name , etc)  Private attributes (Degree, experience, SSN, Address etc) . Only Public attribute would be shared between agents. My question was when Issuer creates Cred Def for User, do ledger store Public attributes of Cred Def, Cred Def ID & its public key or only Cred Def ID & its public key only ?

`...has requirement python3-indy==1.8.1-dev-985, but you'll have python3-indy 1.8.1 which is incompatible.`

Has anyone seen this and defeated it?

@tplooker @MALodder Would be great to include some specifics on generating unique challenge to prevent replay attacks for the generic flow, I'm assuming this is related to/will be used in the auth challenge.

<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 20:23:04 GMT):<br/>
@tomislav I was thinking about this before the way I have thought about it until now is we will have different types of challenges i.e a proof/presentation request could be one, proof of possession of a key could be another. In the case of a proof request @MALodder correct me if I am wrong but the proof request involves nonce generation that could be relied on as a source of randomness to counter replay attacks? Optionally if we see it as warranted I can include a nonce at the message level?

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 20:26:54 GMT):<br/>
@tomislav so if we look at the downsides of a bad nonce this is what can happen:

1- The verifier must generate the nonce otherwise the prover could cheat and fake proofs
2- Randomness helps with security for the prover (verifier cannot learn hidden values) and soundness for the verifier (soundness is prover can't cheat)

Replay attacks can affect both sides but mostly affect the verifier because the verifier could be tricked into accepting a proof that the Prover already computed but may no longer be valid. Usually we rely on hardware or cryptographically secure pseudo random number generators for a nonce. In the case of IoT, it might be helpful to look to external sources for better entropy like the root hash of the Sovrin ledger.

I have created a new draft HIPE that I have called an ephemeral challenge protocol, @kdenhartog @tomislav @nage in particular this may be of interest to you guys as we discussed this concept on the last day of the connectathon. I am planning on producing a couple more HIPEs that detail how this procotol can be realised in an implementation. Feedback welcome :)! https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/8af3a15eea6bd9c2244df86019953012b45e700d/text/ephemeral-challenge-protocol/README.md
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 23:12:39 GMT):<br/>
In particular I have an example of how we can use the protocol on top of oauth to realize several use cases that yield a low barrier of implementation for existing websites

Has anyone seen this https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-auth-jose? As I was saying on the call yesterday I think if we want non-repudiation for auth-crypted messages, perhaps we want the internal format to be a JWS format which contains an agent message inside? Then when the recipient (i.e ephemeral challenge or a connection invite) and the sender would like to provide non-repudiation, they can just send the JWS?

I have a question on the message flow between agents when establishing a connection. The flow is connection_offer (ta->alice), connection_request (alice->ta), connection_response (ta-alice) and connection_acknowledgement (alice->ta). The question I have is how does the ta obtain the verkey of the alice in order to anon encrypt the connection_response message? It works fine in the other direction, where the connection_offer originates from the ta because it can write the DID and verkey to the ledger and alice can retrieve it from there, but alice can't write to the ledger so how does the ta get the verkey?

<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Thu, 28 Feb 2019 21:35:27 GMT):<br/>
@Rowan_Shedden Ah ok, sorry about that, yes the current HIPE is the new format the community is adopting, so referencing that is better, are you just trying to generally understand the protocol or are you designing your own agent?
</p>
<p><strong>Rowan_Shedden</strong> (Thu, 28 Feb 2019 21:46:18 GMT):<br/>
I have already built the agents and have a working system, using the existing protocols ... but the compromise I had to make was that all connections had to originate from a non trust anchor due to the limitation I just asked about. I could have just broken the connection_request message and added the verkey, but I wanted to stay true to the documentation. 
</p>
<p><strong>Rowan_Shedden</strong> (Thu, 28 Feb 2019 21:47:13 GMT):<br/>
I asked my contact in Evernym about this and he suggested I ask the community, hence my post on this forum.  
</p>
<p><strong>Rowan_Shedden</strong> (Thu, 28 Feb 2019 21:49:36 GMT):<br/>
I have spent a lot of time building the existing system I have, which is used to demonstrate Sovrin, so I'm not disposed to having to re-write it to adopt the new protocol.
</p>
<p><strong>Rowan_Shedden</strong> (Thu, 28 Feb 2019 21:51:39 GMT):<br/>
in the new protocol I don't see the verkey being shared anywhere and also no mention of anon or auth encrypting the data in those new connection messages. So, is that all out the window now, with the new protocol?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 28 Feb 2019 21:53:47 GMT):<br/>
The keys are obtained from the DID Document, which may be included or found on the ledger. The new protocol assumes that authcrypt-style wire message format (pack & unpack) is used: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0028-wire-message-format

<p><strong>MattRaffel</strong> (Thu, 28 Feb 2019 21:54:36 GMT):<br/>
Agent to Agent doesnt replace what you're doing with auth encrypting etc.   A2A is about messages between agents.
</p>
<p><strong>Rowan_Shedden</strong> (Thu, 28 Feb 2019 21:55:13 GMT):<br/>
Well, in that case, back to my original question ... how would a non trust anchor write to the ledger? 
</p>
<p><strong>MattRaffel</strong> (Thu, 28 Feb 2019 21:56:30 GMT):<br/>
`indy_submit_request` api
</p>
<p><strong>Rowan_Shedden</strong> (Thu, 28 Feb 2019 21:57:33 GMT):<br/>
I'be not seen that api before, do you have a link to the documentation?
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Thu, 28 Feb 2019 21:58:45 GMT):<br/>
@Rowan_Shedden not all dids and or did docs need to be committed to a ledger either, we are developing what has been coined peer did support where two parties  can connect in a pairwise fashion exchanging the did docs directly. Hence why you can either disclose the did and did doc in the connection request or just the did.
</p>
<p><strong>MattRaffel</strong> (Thu, 28 Feb 2019 21:58:53 GMT):<br/>
you're best bet is to look through the samples in the repo:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk  

the samples and how tos are the best documentation 
</p>

<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Thu, 28 Feb 2019 22:02:15 GMT):<br/>
@Rowan_Shedden for a reference implementation of an agent I would recommend this https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent/tree/master/python also the readme here https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent points at several other agent implementations that are emerging and achieve interoperability at the recent agent connectathon

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=FwGYZH5RypNcDLMSr) @MattRaffel are you suggesting that if I use this function that I can submit a NYM message to the ledger without having to be a trust anchor?
</p>
<p><strong>MattRaffel</strong> (Fri, 01 Mar 2019 15:57:52 GMT):<br/>
@Rowan_Shedden  I'm not completely sure of the context, in terms of what you are seeking to achieve.   If you haven't I strongly encourage recreating one of the samples.   Assuming you are using java:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/samples/java/src/main/java/Anoncreds.java

I believe the shorter answer is no.  Pairwise Dids do not require agent or a endpoint be a trust anchor because those are stored in the wallet not on ledger.

Write NYM transaction for new DID can be performed only by trust anchor+ role.
Simple user can send NYM for his did, like key rotation.
Get request doesn't require signature and any role

A2A is functionality that exists on a level "higher".  Its purpose is to facility communication channels.  Agents still need to use indy sdk APIs to create credentials etc....A2A protocols do not do that.

If you haven't I strongly encourage recreating one of the samples, as they do answer a lot of questions.   Assuming you are using java:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/samples/java/src/main/java/Anoncreds.java

thanks Matt for your explanation, I appreciate your patience with me. I have recreated the samples and looked at that code, but it didn't give me the answer my question which is why I asked the forum. However, your statement "Write NYM transaction for new DID can be performed only by trust anchor+ role." above does answer my question. And it proves what I suspected. That is, you can only initiate the connection_offer (and subsequent to and fro request/response/acknowledgement) to a trust anchor as only a trust anchor can write the NYM transaction for a new DID. That seems like a hole in the connection messaging protocol which I suppose is possibly one of the reasons for moving to the newer connection_invitation protocol.

During our last agent WG call, @tplooker and I were debating the virtues of signing messages versus fields in a message. We got on the subject of repudiation and digital signatures. I got some feedback that some people may have wondered why I thought repudiation was such a big deal. I decided to propose a HIPE that explains this topic carefully, so we can refer to it in many other HIPEs where this issue comes up as a tangent. Here is my PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/100. 

This doc doesn't argue the specific question Tobias and I were hung up on (whether signatures belong at the scope of a message or lower down). It explicitly acknowledges that signatures are the right answer for the use case Tobias was describing (see the section entitled "Unknown Recipient").

To clarify where I stand on this issue, I agree with what @danielhardman outlines in the above HIPE, signing an entire message should only be performed when and where appropriate, what I do believe which perhaps differs from others, is that when an entire message is signed it is more of a wire level concept (i.e where and how it is represented) rather than an application level one, hence my push to use a standardized format such as a JWS to represent this construct as opposed to a nested agent message.

Hey everyone. I have been following the Indy SDK walkthrough https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/docs/getting-started/indy-walkthrough.md using both the Jupyter notebook example and also the NodeJS agent https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent/tree/master/nodejs.

My question is this: in the Jupyter notebook code there is a variable transcript_schema_id which is set when Government creates the Transcript schema definition. Faber then uses transcript_schema_id to get the Transcript schema in order to create a credential definition. In the Jupyter script, Government and Faber are running in the same process so one can pass transcript_schema_id to the other. When Government and Faber are running in different processes, this is not possible of course.

My question is: how does Faber become aware that Government has created the Transcript schema? In the NodeJS agent demo, the agents call the getDidMetadata method and parse the list of schema IDs from the result. When I create the Transcript schema in the Government agent, the getDidMetadata method does return the newly created schema ID. However, the same method returns no new schema IDs in the other agents.

I have checked the log files on the node server and the the schema definition message appears in all 4 logs so everything appears to be working according to my understanding of the Indy Plenum overview https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/docs/source/main.md.

Curiously, when I send a connection request from Government to Faber I see similar activity in the logs and the relationship does get established on both sides. So, there is working IPC between the two agents it's just not working for schema definitions.

I feel like I am missing something very basic here!

@abdfaye What specifically about agents and revocation are you looking for? Revocation message protocol or agent API support?

Hey Everyone, I recently wrote a paper at RWOT8 about self-signed and self-issued credentials. Curious to get comments and feedback from those in the community interested in consumer-facing SSI applications, web of trust, identity for all, and semantic web. You can leave comments on the doc or ping me for further discussion.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=QjyHZj9fnAYvnJpXm) @peteoleary The node.js reference agent is not scanning or searching on the ledger for schema definitions. It retrieves a schema from the ledger `issuer/index.js:16`, but it finds the schema identifier that is saved locally in the wallet from a list of schemas that was created by that agent/wallet. In order to do a proof request, I made a textbox to show a sample proof request for a credential definition that is (again) created on that agent/wallet. You can copy and paste the proof request into another agent's proof request tab to modify/execute it against another agent. A credential definition is retrieved from the ledger by having the credential definition identifier (similar to the schema identifier). Hope this answers your question. Sorry for the delay and possible frustration. Let me know if you have additional questions. Glad your using the node.js agent code. We need more eyes on it. :)

@TelegramSam @swcurran @tomislav @tplooker How does everybody feel about making the following tweak to the Connection Protocol (now merged as HIPE 31), in Connection Request and Connection Response:
* The field named "DID" renamed to "did"
* The field named "DIDDoc" renamed to "did_doc"
This brings it into conformance with our chosen convention, snake_case. I don't like having some fields that abandon that convention for no good reason.

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 18:01:12 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman @TelegramSam do we have any good methodology for "registering" core and non-core protocols. Registering is a bad word but it frames the model im looking for which is an easy way for a developer new to the space to discover implemented protocol docs.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 18:02:18 GMT):<br/>
I was thinking @danielhardman had done something like this already and I know it was discussed to use the ledger later. What should we do until we have infrastructure in place for this?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 18:14:07 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog One of the current HIPE proposals (I thought it was the protocol explainer HIPE, or maybe the feature discovery HIPE) had a list of known protocols, and I was imagining maintaining that list there. However, as I think about it now, that's a bad idea, because it means we have to constantly update a largely static HIPE doc just to enumerate protocols. How about if we simply create a new doc at the root of the indy-hipe repo called "Known Protocols" (known_protocols.md), which is like a Table of Contents that links out to other protocols? The Known Protocols doc could describe each protocol in a sentence or two, and then a link to its HIPE. That way, it would be easy to go to one place to discover anything interesting. Updating that doc could be trivial (all merge requests accepted), since the data in it is purely an index. Any time someone proposes a HIPE that's about a new protocol, their PR should include a tweak to known_protocols.md as well...

Individual protocol HIPEs ought to be updated, IMO, to include a section called "Implementations" that contains notes about implementation progress, and links to agents that are known to implement it. But such info shouldn't be highly dynamic. If you want the latest word on how well an agent implements a protocol, you should go to the information page for the agent (which ought to be linked to from github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent/README.md), and study the latest test suite results.

1. In the response object example from the HIPE (https://github.com/dhh1128/indy-hipe/blob/9c7722d208cfe0a336cb67a626cbbb192ae73f8c/text/feature-discovery/response.json), shouldn't `protocols` be an array object to allow more than one protocol to be returned from the query?
```json

For the Indy Agent WG Call tomorrow we'll be discussing the Credential Exchange message family (Families?) for Issuing Credentials and Presenting Proofs. The proposed HIPE for the message families was updated this morning. Everyone planning to be on the call should read the latest and come ready to discuss. We'd like to get these protocols nailed down.

@smithbk - the encoding is going into the Schema 2.0 work which is going to be finalized and started to be worked on Real Soon Now.  @kenebert is a good person to talk about that.   Until then, I think the idea is just to limp along with no good answer.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-agent?msg=ciYmKm3Nd8E2aoexc) @mwherman2000 can you provide this feedback through the HIPEs so that we can continue this conversation? I'm concerned it will get lost in this channel. In short I agree we should support what you've described.

With regards to 2, I think it would just be `*` rather than prepending the DID, because that DID is supposed to be associated with core protocols. In either case I think it would be better to do `"did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec*"` to make sure we're finding the specs and not like a test agent service for that protocol.

@smithbk @swcurran The work on rich schemas (Schema 2.0) is getting started. Brent Zundel and I are working on the HIPEs to put the design work that encompasses the compatibility with the new Verifiable Credentials Data Model specification and the new rich schemas and associated encodings into a reviewable format. This last week was spent on making sure we had accurate descriptions of the ZKP style proofs in the specification before the candidate recommendation vote on Tuesday.

With regards to error reporting at the wire level (Say I try to unpack and I get an error), what ideas did people have for handling this? I'd like to see us get some basic interop on error handling, and I think this is a good case to work on.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 22:08:30 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman @TelegramSam @tplooker @swcurran and Tomislav (I don't know his handle) were the people I hoped would weigh in on this
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 22:46:21 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog IMO, some vital questions that will drive a lot of decisions about error reporting are:

1. Who can I tell about the problem? (Possible answers include: the sender, the receiver, mediators in between the two; any combination is possible.)
2. Does the problem have a predictable outcome (for example, message must be damaged because it can't be decrypted --> must react as if message were undeliverable) vs. a fuzzy one (for example, message is using a weaker cipher suite than the receiver wanted --> ?)
3. Is the problem recoverable? (sent to an unknown DID = unrecoverable; sent but delivered so slowly that it timed out = recoverable)

I suggest that we find the list of questions (of which these 3 are representative) and the list of possible answers, and then make a matrix (e.g., questions as rows, answers as columns). In each cell, we could say what the recommended error reporting action is. In some cases, the action will be to report the error to just one party. In some cases, the action will be not to report the error at all (avoiding an amplification attack). Etc.

Once we have the matrix and agree upon it, then we can do a standard impl of it--perhaps down in unpack().

@swcurran I'm working on creating a PR against the credential HIPE, and I'm looking at the `offers` attribute comment under `credential-offer` changes. Is it replacing the `credential_preview` attribute or the `~attach` attribute?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 23:09:45 GMT):<br/>
Also relevant, uPort doesn't require a credential_definition. They recommend using schema.org when possible.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 23:16:06 GMT):<br/>
DIF hubs don't appear to describe a cred_def like object either. My plan is to add what we've agreed on then make a secondary commit with changes I'm suggesting to support other credential formats in this protocol.

I have made significant revisions to the attachment HIPE, based on discussions that we had at the agent connect-a-thon. The doc now discusses embedding vs. more generic attachment vs. inlining, and explains the rules that could be used to decide which is appropriate. A new review of the HIPE would be appreciated, especially by people who had opinions on this topic, like @tplooker , @TelegramSam , @swcurran , and @kdenhartog . https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/78

Proposal: To allow for credentials exchange interop at IIW, we need a fixed target. How about we agree on a 0.1 message family proposal that works most easily with the existing SDK, and then continue the current HIPE for a 1.0 release that is more complete and better designed.

Proposal for 0.1 message family: https://hackmd.io/oWSw18DLTYCmHi_ty_gYvg

@TelegramSam I'm okay with the spirit of that proposal. However, let's eliminate the credential-proposal message from it, since we won't be using it at all in the 0.1 family at IIW, and anybody at IIW who sees it and has not been on indy-agent calls will just require explanation. Also, near the bottom of your proposal, can we please rename "claims presentation" to "credential presentation"?

</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 17:59:40 GMT):<br/>
but the two issues you mention are complicated because DIDs are not (yet, at least) common in A2A messages, and a 'resource doesn't exist' error is not broadly applicable to message based communication.

All: I have updated the feature-discovery HIPE per some good feedback from @TelegramSam and @swcurran . I think it is now mature enough to consider FCP status. Note that the name of the protocol is now "protocol-discovery" instead of the more generic "feature-discovery". I think that improves the accuracy of its name vis-a-vis its intent. @mwherman2000 I don't know if this will cause you to have broken hyperlinks in your preso where feature discovery was used as an example of did-url usage; you might want to check.

The PR is still at: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/73

For those that are planning on using the 0.1 version of the Credential Exchange protocol (e.g. not the version being refined in the HIPE), we've tweaked the spec. and are dropping the `credential-proposal` and `presentation-proposal` messages from the implementation. They have been marked as struck out in the document.

I've been working on a `did-uri-spec` specification for generic DID URI grammars...

*Hyperonomy Universal Decentralized Identifier URI Specification (did-uri-spec) *

…which emphasized the different application areas or domains that use DID and how they can be supported with the did-url-spec grammar.
An interesting extension of the did-url-spec specification is the ability to easily customize the generic/baseline did-url-spec grammar to support Domain-specific DID Grammars (DSDGs).  

Here’s a short webcast (16  minutes) that describes this capability:

 I am not getting the concept of indy-agents. In real app, every instance should have a indy-agent installed? if yes then it can only be done with desktop application because a web browser would not be able to handle all functionalities of indy-agent.
Also, want some info about Agent providers and ready-to-use agent offerings?

<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Mon, 01 Apr 2019 13:46:02 GMT):<br/>
An agent is anything that can speak the agent protocol and (usually) has a wallet. Identity owners own one or many agents. Possession of an agent enables an identity owner to interact with others in a Self-Sovreign Identity world. Today, the community has reached consensus on and standardized three different protocols: the connection protocol, enabling the establishment of secure communication between two parties; the BasicMessage protocol, a very simple chat protocol; and the trust ping protocol, a secure connection liveness check. In the near future, agents compliant with the agent test suite will be able to exchange verifiable credentials and much more.

MA Owner goes to EVS website and enters email address, gets an invitation (shortlived) in response that is handled by the MA. It connects with EVS and after connection is offered a credential. The EVS Website is the business rules provider, and the EVS agent is a generic (or at best, configured) IndyCat Agent.

What is the current logic of opening and closing a wallet? From looking at the codebase of a few of the indy-agents (specifically the python ref indy agent and the IndyCat Agent) I see the wallet being opened but never closed. Currently, I have a python decorator that opens the wallet, execute a function, then closes the wallet. Is there a better alternative to this? 
```
def open_close_wallet(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    async def wrapped(*args, **kwargs):
        kwargs["wallet_handle"] = await wallet.open_wallet(
            args[0].wallet_config, args[0].wallet_credentials
        )
        try:
            if not kwargs["wallet_handle"]:
                raise Exception
            else:
                resp = await func(*args, **kwargs)
                await wallet.close_wallet(kwargs["wallet_handle"])

@Dubh3124 This method should work just fine, it's just a little slow if you're constantly opening and closing the wallet. I would also put the `close_wallet` call in a `finally` block instead of having it in two places.

<p><strong>Dubh3124</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 06:41:31 GMT):<br/>
I am experimenting with a Hub agent that is a multi-tenant wallet host. I notice the slowness of opening and closing wallets so trying to find a better solution. Thanks for the input on the `finally`, I will change that
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 07:06:56 GMT):<br/>
You could implement a wallet manager that keeps the wallet handle open for a certain amount of time and closes it if not accessed, although that would only help when you're accessing the same wallet multiple times, not so much if you're switching tenants frequently. IndyCat agent will likely do something like that eventually instead of keeping the wallet permanently open
</p>
<p><strong>Dubh3124</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 07:12:34 GMT):<br/>
Hmm that is a good idea to treat it as a session manager kind of thing, but I wonder what is the security implications of keeping a wallet open.

@tplooker @kdenhartog @TelegramSam @swcurran @saholman  have some new thinking about the idea of connectionless interactions (e.g., the ephemeral challenge protocol that Tobias has outlined). I don't want to go to the effort of writing a long doc about it until we can talk interactively. Could I get some time (maybe 20 min?) on a meeting soon where all of you will be there? I think I can give Tobias the ephemeralness he's after (no back-and-forth to build connections), but in a way that doesn't require a bunch of new, ephemeral protocols and new signature mechanisms. it also will make adjusting to ephemeral use cases much easier inside agent code.

All: I made some ambitious updates to the protocols explainer HIPE. They are not semantic changes--all the same concepts we've been talking about all along are still there, more or less as we've described them. However, I have added many examples, plus some new content to explain state machines a bit better. I also broke the big, monolothic doc into subdocs. Some places worth reading, even for people familiar with what came before, include:

A quick update on some message protocols we (BC Gov, Streetcred) are working on for an upcoming demo. If anyone is thinking of trying to be interoperable with us - here's what we're working on.

First is an "introduction-service" protocol.  This will likely not be used again, as the "introduction" protocol HIPE that Daniel has proposed will be used in the long term. However, for the short term we're using a simpler process that fits exactly our use case. Specs: https://hackmd.io/jhjVAB2fQkiwRnG6CFNvGQ

Second, we are going to use an "action-menu" protocol, where one agent sends another agent a list of options and the other agent selects one option and sends back the selected option.  Specs: https://hackmd.io/s/HkpyhdGtV

Namely, "Must the Consent receipt always (in the end) be in the form of JWT? Might it be in JSON form and not signed or in JSON and signed, bot not coded as JWT ... What are the possible variants the CR Viewer has to be able to read? It says in the spec that JWT (JWE and JWS are also mentioned, but these seem to be a part of JWT) should be used (not must be used)."

Agent Call Recordings Posted: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/indy/2019-04-03+Agent+Call
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 20:02:49 GMT):<br/>
I had someone today question the term "peer-to-peer messaging" for what we are doing with Indy agents that have agency/routing agents in between the endpoints.  His claim is that "peer-to-peer" messaging implies/requires that the two peers know the IP address of each other and talk directly.  Thoughts from others on that?  Do we need to have a different term?
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 20:11:43 GMT):<br/>
Is there any documentation they can point to that talks about the claim? I hadn't heard of an inextricable link between peer and IP address? If they are talking about P2P tech in general most existing implementation would have peers identify by their IP address but I dont see why that imposes a constrain on future tech?
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 20:16:29 GMT):<br/>
Personally `peer` feels pretty divorced from the technology to me?
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 20:20:28 GMT):<br/>
peer DIDs encrypt the message in question ... we still say p2p on internet even though there are routers
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 20:20:55 GMT):<br/>
no intermediary can intercept the message and mess with it
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 20:21:26 GMT):<br/>
they could in theory discard it by they won't know where its going in the inter identity domain zone
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 20:22:02 GMT):<br/>
in the intra identity domain zone there could be ways for cloud agency providers could attempt to interfere with message forwarding
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 20:22:10 GMT):<br/>
at the transport layer
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 20:32:51 GMT):<br/>
We also use "peers" to route the message. It is important that agent messaging not be TCP dependant.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 20:33:59 GMT):<br/>
peer in this case means that there is no service required to perform an intermediary role. There is no Amazon, Facebook, etc in the middle of the operation.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 21:54:55 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the feedback. I'll share that.  I agree - it certainly doesn't bother me as a term.  Further, looking up the Wikipedia definition (which I should have done first) suggests that his definition was not right and our use of it is correct.

</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Tue, 09 Apr 2019 18:51:52 GMT):<br/>
I agree that there should be no problem referring to agent-to-agent messaging as P2P, even if it uses routing agents. But the most accurate term is A2A.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 09 Apr 2019 20:28:57 GMT):<br/>
There may be some nuances of P2P that make this statement true. We're not disabling P2P by any means (agents can talk directly to one another) making it optionally P2P by his definition. However, with certainty we're using end to end encryption.
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 09 Apr 2019 20:56:08 GMT):<br/>

In light of the fact that we have settle on the existence of ephemeral mode type of operation with DIDCom messages. Are we happy to change the current URL based conventions for invites to be more generic i.e change the query parameter from `c_i` to `m` and rely on the decoded type of the message to decide what the message is?

@andrew.whitehead @dbluhm have you 2 (and any others that have independently implemented pack/unpack api) seen PR #1537 in Indy SDK? We're concerned that it will create a breaking change with your implementions. Im thinking it will, so I'd like your opinions on whether we should accept this change. I'm fine with it given the current implemention was declared "experimental" for 1.8.0 release

One value of `c_i` is that it would be semi-uncommon. `m` is a little to common to provide the same value, but maybe `a_m` for agent message or `d_m` for did message?

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 20:47:09 GMT):<br/>
I feel like both case should supported
- Using a single query parameter for all message types makes for a lot better developer experience and is a scalable solution. It also allows for a use case where the message could be encrypted without revealing the information
- Using separate query parameters has its good use cases, since it allows URL processing in routing/domain services to happen without inspecting the content. This has applications in providing better user experience. For example: a vendor can register universal links where they want to redirect all messages with "m" query to their authenticator app, while everything else to the main wallet app.

Perhaps we shouldn't impose these restrictions now but use both cases and re-evaluate this after some time to see if there is a need to either consolidate or decide not to because we may end up needing only few cases.

</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 23:54:09 GMT):<br/>
@tplooker and @sklump @andrew.whitehead We need a value for the query string argument in a URI that makes it possible to register an agent on a mobile device as the handler for all URIs that match the regex. Otherwise a connection invitation will not be intercepted by SSI-aware software but will instead always get handled by the mobile device's browser. Even "c_i" is not great. "m" definitely won't work.
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Sat, 13 Apr 2019 00:08:35 GMT):<br/>
Will review this doc, soon and yes I agree I was merely pointing out that connection invitations are not going to be the only type of DIDCom message send in the url encoded format and hence we need to change this query parameter or url format to reflect that

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 15 Apr 2019 15:31:52 GMT):<br/>
@sklump That's *exactly* why I capitalized. We need a parameter in query strings that is *for sure* going to be used only for agents who understand DIDComms, and that will never appear organically in an unrelated query string's params. Otherwise agents registering to handle such URIs won't reliably get them.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Mon, 15 Apr 2019 15:43:15 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman in that case, ?didcomm=... is better as it explicitly identifies the purpose. My two cents only.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 15 Apr 2019 15:51:34 GMT):<br/>
Okay, that one works for me too.
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Mon, 15 Apr 2019 15:54:17 GMT):<br/>
it's worth pointing out that anything we use will not eliminate a secondary check. First, we capture a URL by regex or presence check of the designated URL param. Second, we evaluate the value of that param to see if it is a proper message. If the second step eval fails, we throw ignore it.

The main purpose of designated URL param is to filter as close as reasonably possible to avoid false positives.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 15 Apr 2019 16:03:50 GMT):<br/>
@TelegramSam I agree that the secondary check is necessary--but its existence doesn't make me comfortable about relaxing the precision matching requirement. While it will not be a problem for an agent if it ends up rejecting a URI with a false match on our query parameter, wouldn't it be a problem for the user who clicked on that URI and expected Chrome to open?

BTW, all the docs I'm finding about registering custom URI handlers on Android and iOS assume that the customization comes in the scheme portion of the URI, NOT in a query string. Do you have any links where we can read about registering a URI handler based just on a query string param?
</p>

A scheme handler feels like a much better bet, but we'd loose the boostrapping capability of a new user hitting a website.

How do I set the target path for the reference agent to find the binary?

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 23 Apr 2019 16:22:49 GMT):<br/>
With regards to the P2P discussion, we also support both mediated P2P (when using mobile devices and non-static IP addresses) and direct P2P (which causes privacy concerns because of traffic analysis)
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 23 Apr 2019 18:22:35 GMT):<br/>
Hey I was just thinking about this. Would it be possible (definitely astronaut architecting here) for an agent to send the message family handler code to a receiver in a verified, secure way?

Did we decide to cancel the Indy Agent call today in deference to IIW?

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 01 May 2019 15:05:31 GMT):<br/>

I thought it would be great to share with you some of our next open steps. We would also like to contribute components to the larger Hyperledger community.

<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Mon, 06 May 2019 03:26:24 GMT):<br/>
The Mattr team is pleased to announce the open sourcing of osma - an open source mobile agent built on top of AgentFramework (https://github.com/streetcred-id/agent-framework), this project is still in development but we hope it will be of great community value to accelerate the development of mobile agents. Check it out at https://github.com/mattrglobal/osma and get in touch if you have any queries!
</p>
<p><strong>atomeel</strong> (Mon, 06 May 2019 07:00:09 GMT):<br/>
@tplooker Is the osma project targeting iOS or Android? I pulled the source to take a look and couldn't get the release configuration to build yet: I tested on Android ARM64 phone + x86 AVD and iPhone actual device + simulator, and so far it only worked on the iPhone simulator on debug configuration after manually linking the pre-built libs from the agent-framework repo, not sure if this is normal or not? (noob to Xamarin/C#, so very likely to be my problem :smile: )
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Mon, 06 May 2019 16:18:23 GMT):<br/>
@atomeel It's Xamarin Forms targeting both iOS and Android. Generally, Release mobile configurations are used in distribution pipelines tied to distribution signing artifacts. Local deployments should run fine in Debug configuration.

<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Mon, 06 May 2019 19:31:55 GMT):<br/>
@atomeel so you have got iOS but not android working? In regards to the libraries, did you call git lfs pull when you cloned it? As the libs folder in each platform project should have the binaries?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Mon, 06 May 2019 19:36:43 GMT):<br/>
@tplooker There are some missing libs in the repo, inadvertently removed when moving things. There's a PR pending the fixes this.

I'm getting some errors building the Android version, running on a Mac using Visual Studio Community if that matters:
1. Can't find AgentFrameWork.Core >= 4.0.0-preview.365
2. ConnectionsViewModel.cs(47,47): Error CS0308: The non-generic method 'MessageUtils.DecodeMessageFromUrlFormat(string)' cannot be used with type arguments (CS0308) (Osma.Mobile.App)
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:55:52 GMT):<br/>
@ianco is this with the current head of master?
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 23:11:44 GMT):<br/>
@ianco can you try pulling the head of master now? I believe this was due to some environments not dealing with the dependency when it is transient, I have now made this explicit for the Osma.Mobile.App project
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 00:07:47 GMT):<br/>
I'll give it a try now

</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 00:13:05 GMT):<br/>
You should see that there is a local nuget package configuration next to the solution that adds this as another package feed https://github.com/mattrglobal/osma/blob/master/src/nuget.config
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 00:13:45 GMT):<br/>
I'll try it on windows, it's possibly an issue with the mac community version
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 00:13:54 GMT):<br/>
... of Visual Studio
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 00:14:34 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 00:17:36 GMT):<br/>
Yeap also is it asking for 4.0.0-preview.365 or 635
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 00:22:58 GMT):<br/>
Build is working but when I try to deploy (local nexus emulator) I get "cannot determine abi of native library libs/armeabi/libindy.so"
</p>
<p><strong>tplooker</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 00:23:48 GMT):<br/>
Cool you also need to call `git lfs pull` before you build as the indy binaries are stored using git fls
</p>

Is an Indy Agent "formally" expected to have a UI component? ...e.g. either a GUI or web UI? ...is the the boundary of an Agent limited to it being a mid-tier server exposing a set of services? ...e.g. comms, wallet, etc. ....asking for a friend ;-)

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 15:35:28 GMT):<br/>
@Zohaib_Sohail - if you are trying to go beyond running the node example - suggest that you go to the https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent repo, nodejs folder. The education repo you are using is a snapshot of that repo taken for the edX course - a snapshot so it stays stable.  The nodejs implementation in the indy-agent repo has evolved a little from there.

Not certain it will solve your problem, but it's a better starter location if you are going to dig deeper into the nodejs agent.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 15:39:18 GMT):<br/>
FYI - note that nodejs agent is not in active development right now. If you know python - take a look at the python folder in the indy-agent repo. It's in active development.

There is also a second python agent in active development, and one in .NET/C# if those are of interest.

ALL:

The Peer DID Method Spec is maturing nicely, thanks to thoughtful improvements from many--especially Oskar van Deventer and Christian Lundkvist. We still have more to do, though.

You can help in the following two ways:

1. Please review this PR and express an opinion about whether it should be accepted: https://github.com/openssi/peer-did-method-spec/pull/32

This PR would change the way a peer DID's numeric basis is generated. Instead of generating from the initial public key, it would use a sha256 hash of the initial version of the DID Doc, which means the initial DID Doc could have any number of keys, and that it wouldn't be vital to rotate the one and only initial key value immediately after being used to generate the DID.

2. Please read at least section 5 of Oskar's doc here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SgKvuG7u0r5UkaDRnnkQmnarVylCx5VF5y0eIyV-I6Y/edit. Perhaps we can discuss some of the questions he raises in our next Aries call.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 19:16:52 GMT):<br/>
Socializing a possible convention: I'd like to suggest that *protocols be named by a verb, not a noun*. For example, we would have the "issue credential" protocol, not the "credential issuance" protocol; "connect" instead of "connection".

My reasoning: You can do lots of things with a noun. With the noun "connection", for example, I could "build" it, "destroy" it, "maintain" it, etc. By naming protocols after a noun, I think we're creating an inherent fuzziness that would go away if we named them with a verb or verb phrase.

I was wondering if there was someone here form the bcgov team that could help me with using indy-catalyst (or anyone else who is familiar with the project). I got the agent to run per these instructions (https://github.com/bcgov/indy-catalyst/tree/master/agent) But there is a lack of documentation on how to work with the agent post set up, e.g. what calls can be made and what to pass with those calls. Appreciate the help!

We can help. DM me to start and I'll connect you wil the right person on the team.  If you are just getting started with it and want to run it locally to see it running, I suggest you use this - https://github.com/bcgov/greenlight/blob/master/docker/VONQuickStartGuide.md.  That's the production version.

indycatalyst that you are working with is still in progress and will soon replace the current production version, bringing a well-designed agent, a more scalable credential registry and an indy-agent HIPE/Aries RFC basis for interoperability.

Just wanted to double check :) like @kdenhartog and @pleerock above I'd be very keen to see an open source native example to learn from. (Also I hope a React Native example using indy may turn up someday for similar reasons :) )

thanks so much for the OSMA suggestion, I am looking at it and hope to learn what I can. As @pleerock mentioned above, I see it is a Xamarin project built in C# using a dependency on streetcred AgentFramework project, which itself is an abstraction on top of Indy SDK. I never heard of Xamarin before seeing this so atleast I've learned that so far :upside_down: 

If anyone discovers something closer to Java native mobile app using the indy sdk they'll be showered by virtual warm wishes and praise by noobs like me trying to get a head start on learning all this stuff :thumbsup: :smile: The closest thing I found searching around might be https://github.com/AxelNennker/DroidLibIndy but I haven't looked at it in any detail, atleast seems to show the setup of a new Android Studio project...

@rfu2k my understanding is there's a few people interested in a react native implementation. There's one that is hard to build called the connector-app built with react native. 

It's found here: https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/connector-app 
As @tplooker and @swcurran pointed out theres OSMA which is not native, but is open source.
This may be another interesting project worth looking at which appears to be a native app and open source: https://github.com/Quintor/StudyBitsWallet
The best place to reference them is normally here, but it didn't have @AxelNennker listed: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent

Hi All, I very new to Indy-Agent. Here I saw the getting started use case of Alice to get the Transcript from Faber university and got the job in Acme corporation based on the transcript and submit the employment proof credential to Thrift bank to get done the lone approval. This complete use case having only one piece of code without any indy- Agent implementation. If this use case working without Indy-Agent then what is the use of Indy-agent for this or any other cases which includes the IoT devices as well. Please let me know what is the exact use of indy-Agent and advantages to have indy-agent. Thanks in Advance.

<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Sat, 08 Jun 2019 21:03:18 GMT):<br/>
Hi @pradeepjain, 
The reason that the [getting started code](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/docs/getting-started/getting-started.ipynb) is only in one script is to simply demonstrate the range of API calls that different entities can make to the indy SDK in order to create and exchange credentials. The code acts as if Alice, Faber College, Acme corp, and Thrift bank are all storing their wallets on a single device. 

This simplification eliminates the complexity that arises when credentials are exchanged across a variety of different uses cases, operating systems, devices, transport protocols, and privacy needs. The real world uses of Indy become very complicated when thinking about all of these layers.

The Indy-Agent and [Hyperledger Aries](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/ARIES/Hyperledger+Aries) project provides the necessary cryptographic wallet infrastructure and a common set of protocols to enable blockchain-rooted, peer to peer interactions in the real world. This includes use cases like the Alice demo, but is meant to expand to many use cases even including IoT devices. It's pretty exciting stuff, and we're happy to have you here building with us. 

Let us know if you have any other questions! Thanks

Also I found an indy-agent for IoT devices https://github.com/evernym/connectathon-agent Can I use this agent for IoT devices or you want to suggest something different. Thanks

Hi all, I was learning for some time now Indy project and now I am at the point to start implementing an Indy application on top of a private Indy's ledger, to provide Decentralized Identities.

Hey guys - I've been exploring the indy-sdk implementation in nodejs. When I run npm i --save indy-sdk the following error is thrown: LINK : fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file '.lib' ... I've also run into issues when installing libindy on Windows 10 (so I do not have it installed right now, maybe thats what is causing the error?). Everything runs successfully with Docker though.

OS: Windows 10 (x64)
Libindy Installed: No

@carlojb01 #indy-sdk is probably the correct channel for your question :slight_smile: If you're willing to, it would also be very helpful if you opened the question on Stack Overflow then linked to your question on #indy-sdk  so the answer becomes discoverable by others in the future.

Hello everyone! My question is about indy-agent. I wondering if there single protocol for indy-agent, or there are many different implementations of it (described https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent#known-agent-implementations). For instance https://github.com/evernym/connectathon-agent/ has different message format then indy-agent. So is there some standard way to communicate between indy actors which is supported by majority? Or indy-agent implementation is just an example how it can be done? Is indy-agent a production solution? And is it still under development/supported?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 28 Jun 2019 13:53:33 GMT):<br/>
At a low level, there is a standard way to communicate between indy agents which is supported by *all* of them. It is called "DID Communication" or DIDComm. It is documented here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0005-didcomm.

At a higher level, each agent has to choose what transports it is going to support. Most of the ones built so far support http; a few have implemented DIDComm on top of smtp or other transports.

But just like two things that talk http can only talk if they understand one another's web service interfaces, so two agents can only get work done together if they both speak the same protocols. You can think of protocols as web service APIs: you have one protocol for connecting, and it involves several different message exchanges (API calls); another protocol for exchanging credentials (again, several different message exchanges or APIs), and so forth.

Protocols are described here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0003-protocols/README.md

As far as the indy-agent codebase: This codebase is getting less attention right now. You may be better off looking at some sample agents in Aries: aries-cloudagent-python (which is being used to build production solutions), aries-staticagent-python, etc.

Until now we are implementing only client->server connections, when client (mobile phone) is always initiates all types of interactions. Now we'd like to implement something like push notifications using Firebase. As far as i understand indy-agent is early implementation of communication btw agents via http. ACA-PY goes the same way, but applies some common concepts described in rfcs (w3c). Am i right?
So there is still no Firebase push notifications, right?

May be i misunderstood agent conception. Let me describe it by example, please correct me if i wrong.
Alice knows agent uri and sends REQUEST message. Agent saves dids pair and respond with did/verkey. Alice also stores pair. Then Bob appears. There would be 2 cases. 1) Bob also knows agent url and goes same way as Alice. 2) Alice invites Bob (INVITE message), then agent sends REQUEST to Bob, and then Bob replies with RESPONSE. Then Alice is able to send messages to Bob via agent, because agent has pair did/endpoint. Messages could be any type and for i don't get why indy-agent or ACA-PY is implementing more types because for me it seems that agent has to just forward messages. I think I missed something at that point or may be even before.

Re: notifications. For a mobile agent, the request response model (client-server) for messaging and mobile platform ntofications seem to be sufficient. The Firebase-type notifications, tell the person - "hey, there's a message" and the person triggers to client request to the server (the cloud agent). You can see that in action with the StreetCred agent in the IIW Book demo.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 14:36:13 GMT):<br/>
Not quite sure of your case 1, but case 2 seems right. ACA-Py supports more messages because you can build a full edge agent (equivalent to mobile) with it for enterprises (as an example). We are using ACA-Py agents to issue, hold and proof verifiable credentials in an enterprise (gov't) context.

<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 16:30:14 GMT):<br/>
When we discussed it last time, we felt that Indy Agents would continue to exist for some time, until Aries development had progressed enough. So I added the announcement at the top of the channel and left it open.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 03 Jul 2019 16:30:37 GMT):<br/>

Hello everyone, so I am learning about the concepts of wallets in indy and had some questions. I hope I could get some input from the folks here or a direction to proceed. I apologize if I have not used the correct technical vocabulary to ask the question, I am still learning. 
</p>
<p><strong>ravip</strong> (Tue, 09 Jul 2019 23:30:31 GMT):<br/>
This is one of the questions: Can you and should you store IPFS links to PII images in user's indy wallet?

<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 14:25:14 GMT):<br/>
@ravip this channel has been mostly superseded by the Aries project and questions about agents and/or aries should be directed to #aries. Your specific question will likely find a better audience in #indy or #indy-sdk. I suggest asking your question there :slight_smile:

@danielhardman @swcurran  Hello! I am trying to understand the conception of mediators, bacause we need to implement push notifications on mobile. I've read rfc, but still have some questions. First is how mediator resolves recepient address from 'to' field? I guess it should find connection by 'to' verkey, then check corresponding DIDDoc and get serviceEndpoint. Is this correct?
And the last question. Sending firebase message requires some user-token, so as i understand it should be placed in serviceEndpoint. Right? But no ideas about format of it. Please clear this moment.
Also may be you can point to some explanation of how to establish connections between two mobile phones through cloud agent. It probably already done in IIW-book demo, but i could not find any resources. Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 06:53:31 GMT):<br/>
@ravip and @dbluhm Actually, I think the #aries channel is the most appropriate for those questions now, as most Indy agent discussions have moved there.
