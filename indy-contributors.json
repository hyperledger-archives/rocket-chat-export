{"msg":"@esplinr, @nage, @danielhardman, @TelegramSam, @jljordan_bcgov and Sovrin team - a question for you.  \n\nWe (BC Gov) have a Ledger Browser that we have used against several indy-node network instances.   The Ledger Browser starts up and sequentially reads the ledger transactions from 1 in chunks (e.g. 500 per chunk) until it hits the end, and then queries the ledger every n minutes (2 is usual) to get new transactions as they are added.  The transactions are stored in a simple database (SQLFile maybe? - not really crucial) and the ledger browser supports filtering by type, name and page.  We add more functionality from time to time. We ran this on the Sovrin Testnet and it worked fine - 50000 transactions in about a day.\n\nExample: http://dflow.bcovrin.vonx.io (front page) and http://dflow.bcovrin.vonx.io/browse/domain (ledger browser/filter).\n\nWe'd like to use this to enable browsing the Sovrin Mainnet by using our own Mainnet DID to do the reading.

{"msg":"@TelegramSam @danielhardman I was just looking into invitation protocol and I think we have a MITM problem. A MITM seems small when setting up a connection, but as the connection becomes trusted it could allow the MITM some powerful capabilities. For example, if Mallory is able to inject a key into the DID Doc into Alice's DID Doc it seems useless because the connection isn't trusted. Lets say Alice presents proof though, and Bob trust's its truly Alice. Then Alice submits a proof request to Bob, Mallory forwards this on and then Bob issues the credential. Bob sends it back to Alice and she stores it in her wallet. Then Mallory decides to submit a proof request for a second credential. Mallory generates a second link secret and submits a proof request. Given Bob \"trusts\" this connection because he already has received a credential, he offers a proof to Mallory thinking its Alice's second agent. Now Mallory posesses a credential to impersonate Alice, Bob doesn't know he issued to Mallory, and Alice doesn't know there's been a second credential issued.","username":"kdenhartog","ts":"2019-03-15T03:17:42.775Z"}

Now, Alice asks \"Bob\" to prove that he has a driver's license. That's it--no deep disclosure, no predicates, even. She just wants to know she's dealing with a real person. Mallory takes out her digital driver's license credential and proves this to Alice. Mallory also relays this request to Bob, and has Bob prove it to Mallory. Alice has now received the proof she expected, and Bob has given the proof he was asked for, and neither party has been able to detect the MITM.\n\nThis is not avoided by the \"ZKPs can't be proxied\" claim you have made, because Mallory is making no attempt to proxy Bob's proof to Alice; instead, Mallory is throwing away Bob's proof and substituting her own.\n\nWhat I am recommending doesn't solve this problem, either--yet. But carry the relationship forward a bit. Now Alice needs to know something meaningful about Bob. She asks Bob to prove that he has a bank account and lives in Canada (where Bob is supposed to live). It is in Mallory's interests to look as much like Bob as possible, so Alice will eventually disclose unsafe info or send money that Mallory can siphon off. So Mallory now has 2 choices:\n\n1. Try to proxy Bob's legitimate proof requests, tweaking them per Mallory's convenience. As you have said, this doesn't work.\n\n2. Go out on the dark web and buy a credential from someone who lives in Canada.\n\nApproach 2 is where what I'm recommending becomes useful. If Mallory buys a credential from such a source, and uses it to substitute her own proof request, the credential will have a link secret that is different from the one Mallory used to do her initial proof.

{"msg":"Basically to prevent MITM, the discovery mechanism needs to allow both parties to agree on what was sent. \n\nIf the discovery is two people taking in person and one showing the other a QR code that is scanned and the other doing likewise, that’s one example. I may post my connection info on an orphaned website that I only tell new connections about and they confirm that info via phone, sms, email, snail mail, what have you. Most services today have a semi trusted service that handles this for us by uploading an identity key of some kind and as long as we trust the service not to lie about the identity key and also confirm with the other party that the key belongs to them either by fingerprinting, safety numbers then we’re safe.\n\nFor self sovereignty, ssb helps with the discovery of new people and we can piggyback on that idea but add the extra confirmation step with new connections. Existing connections are already secured if we use the TOFU approach. Ssb can also help me find existing connections and sync up with them without the internet.

The README has a note at the top explaining how/why this HIPE is a bit anomalous, and it links to the larger content.\n\nYou can see the README here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/b338473a10a655f0e2c915a7c2b029d7eeef1e1a/text/dkms/README.md\n\nI suggest that we assign this HIPE a number from the small set of numbers < 10 that are reserved for truly foundational material.

It arose out of years-long efforts by community members to wrap their brains around how key management should be solved without a central authority. It represents deep thinking by many industry experts, including important voices outside the Indy community. It is published on a deadline, as part of a research grant from the US Department of Homeland Security. Because of this, the normal community collaboration process is somewhat inverted; maintainers have agreed to publish the doc directly, and then open it up for community contribution and polishing after-the-fact.```","username":"danielhardman","ts":"2019-03-29T23:00:57.596Z"}

{"msg":"@esplinr @sergey.minaev @andrew.nikitin I'm designing a _true_ rpm repository for Sovrin and Indy artifacts, and I came up with a versioning system that I believe effectively balances our needs with convention and allows for proper package sorting, (\"convention\" mostly coming from the [Fedora Packaging Guidelines](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Versioning/)). Here's the breakdown:\n\n- `stable`: The `Version` field contains the version tagged in the git repository that adheres to semantic version standards, (e.g. `1.14.2`). Because all stable releases will be tracked with a separate version, the `Release` field will always be `1`.\n- `rc`: The `Version` field will use the version projected to be released from it. To differentiate it from the `stable` versions, `Release` will always be of the form `0.<jenkins build number>`. The `0.` signifies its state as a prerelease.\n- `master` and other dev builds: By convention, the `Version` should be set to `0`, and `Release` should be of the form `<branch name>.<jenkins build number>.<snapshot w/ git revision id>`.\n\nIn this system, each stream is separately installable. e.g.,\n\n- `stable`: `yum install libindy`. This will always track stable.\n- `rc`: Assuming `1.14.2` has not released yet, `yum install libindy-1.14.2`. This will grab the prerelease and track stable once stable matches/passes that `1.14.2`.\n- `master`: `yum install libindy-0-master`. This will track the master branch as far as I can tell. It may try to upgrade to a different branch that sorts sooner than \"master\" does, like \"feature-xx\"\n\nI've definitely had pushback on the \"version master as 0\" standard, and I'm willing to change that if anyone has a better solution.\n\nAlso, this proposal will come with a some changes to the CD pipeline, (not unexpectedly), but in some places will require the CI system to know what the next version of stable will be, (see `rc` standard ^^). I'm not sure how easy/difficult that would be to implement, and/or how much maintainer intervention is needed to handle that.\n\nThoughts?\n\n(A preview of the repository is available for viewing [here](https://repo.sovrin.org/nexus/#browse/browse:rpm))","username":"SteveGoob","ts":"2020-01-22T23:06:56.721Z"}

{"msg":"Hey folks --- on the Indy Contributors call this coming Tuesday (July 21, 8AM Pacific), we're going to be talking again about the DID Method underlying Indy -- currently \"did:sov\" and at the interoperability of the DID Method and Aries across multiple ledgers.

My thought is that we (I??) need to organize a \"Connectathon\" like multi-day virtual conference to explore the possible solutions, decide on a sufficient goal endpoint, agree on what code needs to be implemented and define a plan to get the resources to do the coding.\n\nPlease join us on Tuesday for this discussion -- https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/indy/2020-07-21+Indy+Contributors+Call","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-07-17T20:35:07.459Z"}

{"msg":"I'd like to propose a different approach going forward.  Basically, the only difference between what we have released and the main/master branch is Rich Schema.  Assuming that is true, I'd like to propose that we drop the Rich Schema work and instead of bringing up the release to what's been merged, we instead bring master/main to match what we've released.  I say that with apologizes to Brent.\n\nWhy?  It's a combination of BBS+ and the new DID spec. \n\nFirst, with BBS+ we are removing the need for objects on the ledger to better align with other communities, while still supporting (at least) ZKPs, selective disclosure and revocation.  Schemas are replaced with JSON-LD which can be on or off ledger.  I cannot see us going to the more complex Rich Schema solution that is very Indy specific vs. just using JSON-LD.\n\nSecond, if we do want the schema information (the JSON-LD documents) on ledger, that can be done with \"normal\" DIDs according to the new DID spec.

{"msg":"@swcurran @sergey.minaev @esplinr \nBBS+ signatures are great. The way the public key can be extended to sign as many messages as are in a credential is fantastic, which means that the need for a cred def on the ledger can be eliminated (as long as the revocation registry is also sent as part of the credential). \nSchemas may be anchored anywhere. The need for an immutable record of a schema depends on the trust framework. Rich schemas provides one mechanism for immutable anchoring a schema. Another method that may serve most use cases is to send the schema used as part of the signed credential.\nTo this point, I can see the argument to no longer feel that rich schemas are necessary, however, the signing mechanism of BBS+ still expects the signed assertions to be represented as integers. How should an issuer specify how each asseretion has been converted? The current method used with CL signatures may be adequate for simple use cases, but we run into more and more cases where it would be very valuable for an issuer to be able to specify a more complex encoding scheme than \"all strings are hashed.\" I do not know of an answer for this other than rich schema mappings and encodings.\nThere is also the rich schema notion of anchoring a presentation definition to the ledger. As the ecosystem grows, having a set of common, publicly available, immutable presentation definitions may not only be valuable, it may be vital.\nUnless satisfactory answers can be found for the full scope of capabilities provided by rich schemas, then it doesn't make sense to me to remove them.","username":"brentzundel","ts":"2020-10-05T18:24:37.477Z"}

Because they are actually BBS+LD-Signatures, they also make use of real-world JSON-LD schemas.

{"msg":"One of the things that we would like to see in the CI/CD work that is happening in indy-node and indy-plenum is a simplification of the branching model being used.  We would like to see a simpler model where there is Main (aka Master) branch, and short lived PR branches for features. Releases are tagged commits on Main, and if an urgent patch is needed, a special branch is made from the release tag and handled appropriately.\n\nThat would eliminate the use of the Stable branch and the RC branches.  CI would trigger automatically on merges into Main, ideally, also on PR creation/update and we'll decide on the CD trigger/Tag creation strategy.\n\nWe welcome input on this approach and how best to accomplish it. Since we are currently \"stuck\" on our ability to release, this seems like a good time to do this.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-12-11T15:16:10.276Z"}

She mentioned to me that \"there are so many tests and they require so many resources that when you run all of them at once, problems may arise due to the overload of the OS\".\n\nI will look at your docker environment and see if the failing tests look consistent with what I saw on my 16.04 environment. I will update you with my stauts.","username":"rmarsh","ts":"2021-01-29T15:02:03.392Z"}
{"msg":"@RobinKlemens `python3-indy` it's a Libindy (from indy-sdk) python wrapper. /usr/lib/libindy.so - the main library. It was tested with ubuntu 18, but never with ubuntu 20.

There are a number of places that `ENV RUBY_VERSION=2.3.0` is defined to pick the version of ruby to install for the build.  However, if I'm reading things correctly it looks like that only affects the centos based images, while the build is using `/token-plugin/devops/ext/docker/base/xenial/Dockerfile.0.2.0` by setting `OSNAME=xenial` and `BASE_DOCKER_VERSION=0.2.0`.  This version of the dockerfile is installing `ruby 2.3` by default.\n\nOptions seem to be;\n1) Setup the build to use one of the centos build containers and set the `RUBY_VERSION=2.4.0` or higher.\n2) Add support for defining the ruby version in the xenial build containers.\n3) Pin `fpm` to a version that supports `ruby 2.3`\nWith any of these options there is the chance of knock-on dependency issues that need to be addressed.\n\nThoughts?","username":"WadeBarnes","ts":"2021-02-20T21:35:05.583Z"}

Here is a snippet of the error, in hopes that @Toktar or @antonden has seen something similar before:\n\nagent_1 | NOTIFICATION stp_core.common.log:keep_in_touch.py:66 Delta’s connections changed from {‘Alpha’} to {‘Gamma’, ‘Alpha’, ‘Beta’}\nagent_1 | NOTIFICATION stp_core.common.log:keep_in_touch.py:91 CONNECTION: Delta now connected to Beta\nagent_1 | NOTIFICATION stp_core.common.log:keep_in_touch.py:91 CONNECTION: Delta now connected to Gamma\nagent_1 | INFO stp_core.common.log:motor.py:33 Delta changing status from starting to started\nagent_1 | TRACE stp_core.common.log:remote.py:164 Event: {‘event’: 4096, ‘value’: 0, ‘endpoint’: b’tcp://127.0.0.1:0;127.0.0.1:6001’}\nagent_1 | TRACE stp_core.common.log:remote.py:119 Remote Alpha:HA(host=’127.0.0.1’, port=6001) has monitor events: [4096]\nagent_1 | DEBUG stp_core.common.log:node.py:1257 Delta choosing to start election on the basis of count 4 and nodes {‘Gamma’, ‘Alpha’, ‘Beta’}\nagent_1 | DEBUG stp_core.common.log:node.py:2983 Delta sending message LEDGER_STATUS{‘ledgerId’: 0, ‘txnSeqNo’: 4, ‘viewNo’: None, ‘ppSeqNo’: None, ‘merkleRoot’: ‘38dJSTuhPsur1VbV3LuMmESRXxsdkg8n8MPSG32cVP1C’, ‘protocolVersion’: 2} to 1 recipients: [‘Beta’]\nagent_1 | DEBUG stp_core.common.log:node.py:2983 Delta sending message LEDGER_STATUS{‘ledgerId’: 0, ‘txnSeqNo’: 4, ‘viewNo’: None, ‘ppSeqNo’: None, ‘merkleRoot’: ‘38dJSTuhPsur1VbV3LuMmESRXxsdkg8n8MPSG32cVP1C’, ‘protocolVersion’: 2} to 1 recipients: [‘Gamma’]\nagent_1 | TRACE stp_core.common.log:zstack.py:549 Alpha got 9 messages through listener\nagent_1 | TRACE stp_core.common.log:zstack.py:777 Alpha got ping from Beta\nagent_1 | TRACE stp_core.common.log:zstack.py:852 Alpha transmitting message b’po’ to Beta by socket 510 39930560\nagent_1 | DEBUG stp_core.common.log:zstack.py:758 Alpha ponged Beta\nagent_1 | TRACE stp_core.common.log:zstack.py:777 Alpha got ping from Gamma\nagent_1 | TRACE stp_core.common.log:zstack.py:852 Alpha transmitting message b’po’ to Gamma by socket 516 40946032\nagent_1 | DEBUG stp_core.common.log:zstack.py:758 Alpha ponged Gamma\nagent_1 | TRACE stp_core.common.log:zstack.py:777 Alpha got ping from Delta\nagent_1 | TRACE stp_core.common.log:zstack.py:852 Alpha transmitting message b’po’ to Delta by socket 514 40907632\nagent_1 | DEBUG stp_core.common.log:zstack.py:758 Alpha ponged Delta\nagent_1 | TRACE stp_core.common.log:zstack.py:791 Alpha got pong from Beta\nagent_1 | TRACE stp_core.common.log:zstack.py:791 Alpha got pong from Gamma\nagent_1 | TRACE stp_core.common.log:zstack.py:791 Alpha got pong from Delta\nagent_1 | DEBUG stp_core.common.log:eventually.py:174 partial(check_node_connected) succeeded with 19.50 seconds to spare\nagent_1 | DEBUG stp_core.common.log:eventually.py:174 partial(check_node_connected) succeeded with 19.50 seconds to spare\nagent_1 | DEBUG stp_core.common.log:eventually.py:174 partial(check_node_connected) succeeded with 19.50 seconds to spare\n…\nagent_1 | DEBUG stp_core.common.log:eventually.py:161 partial(check_node_connected) last try…\n*agent_1 | ERROR stp_core.common.log:eventually.py:188 partial(check_node_connected) failed; not trying any more because 19.49565719999373 seconds have passed; args were ()*\n*agent_1 | DEBUG stp_core.common.log:eventually.py:96 a coro partial(check_node_connected) with args (Delta, {Beta, Gamma, Alpha}) timed out without succeeding; fail count: 1, acceptable: 0*\nagent_1 | ERROR stp_core.common.log:looper.py:253 Error while running coroutine checkNodesConnected: AssertionError(‘assert False\\n + where False = all([False, False, True])’)\nagent_1 | INFO stp_core.common.log:motor.py:33 Delta changing status from started to stopping\nagent_1 | INFO stp_core.common.log:node.py:3063 node Delta current stats","username":"devinleighsmith","ts":"2021-04-07T17:07:28.941Z"}
