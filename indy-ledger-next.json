{"msg":"As per proof-of-non-revocation (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0011-cred-revocation#presenting-proof-of-non-revocation):\n\nThe prover can calculate an updated witness u by finding the product of all of the non-revoked entries in the tails file and excluding its own entry. The Prover also knows its own factor, b, because it was given its entry's index in the tails file, and can calculate u*b = e, where e is the accumulator. \nThe prover then uses zero knowledge proof to prove to the issuer that he knows u and b using product proofs.\n\nNow let’s say the prover has 2 credential definitions, one which is revoked and one which is not. My question is what stops the prover to use u and b from the credential definition that was not revoked while sharing a credential definition that was revoked.\n\nExample: Let’s say a prover has a driving license and a university degree from a same issuer. Then the issuer revokes the driving license but not the university degree. In this case while sharing driving license with the verifier the prover also shares u and b values of university degree and not driving license (since driving licence was revoked).","username":"vardan10","ts":"2019-11-05T09:26:18.525Z"}
