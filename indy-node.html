Ledger WG call notes: we are currently merging recent changes with a "3-phase commit" feature in sovrin-node, and also a "state trie" feature.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 15:15:42 GMT):<br/>
These features introduce batching into Indy, which provides important performance benefits. State trie also makes it possible for us to receive a single response to the query, instead of the F+1 responses required by consensus. The single response is trustworthy because it contains at least F+1 digital signatures. Also, state trie makes it possible to prove that the answer to a query is the latest correct answer (has not been superseded at any time since the point when it was correct).
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 15:16:13 GMT):<br/>
The merge is complex, and we spent some time on the call discussing implications for testing, risks of disruption in the master branch, etc.

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 15:25:48 GMT):<br/>
We have discovered an additional change that is part of the same sequence of commits as the stuff we're trying to merge. This additional change may need to be separated from the rest of the logic by reordering commits or something.

Q: should "TGB member" have any role in the system at all?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 15:53:03 GMT):<br/>
We discussed and concluded that at most, a TGB member should have the privilege to propose an upgrade. Also discussed signing .deb files with a PGP key using an ED25519 curve, where key is stored on our ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 16:03:29 GMT):<br/>
Also discussed whether any of the governance rules baked into code today need to become configurable (in the config ledger rather than config files, to make the rules public and uniform across all participants)

Lovesh: for the last two weeks we have been working on the election process and the view change
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:05:34 GMT):<br/>
...: this protocol had a few problems so we have moved to a simpler version of round-robin leader selection
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:06:18 GMT):<br/>
...: a bunch of view change problems were also uncovered under load, where the protocol could get stuck (state wasn't being communicated properly during the view change)
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:06:35 GMT):<br/>
...: we discussed 4 different approaches from PBFT, and settled on the simplest one
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:06:52 GMT):<br/>
...: we are almost done with that change and are hoping to raise those changes into master next week
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:07:23 GMT):<br/>
...: one more thing that we've been wondering about is our quorum sizes, we've been doing 2f+1 and f+1, but if the n value isn't exactly 3f+1 this creates some problems
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:07:57 GMT):<br/>
...: the 2f+1 number is fine, but the f+1 doesn't create an intersecting quorum with the writes and reads
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:08:47 GMT):<br/>
...: so we're looking at (f+n+2)/2 as an alternative for prepare and commit quorums and then n-f for the view change quorums
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:09:00 GMT):<br/>
...: thanks to the Fabric guys for pointing us to the code where they are using these numbers
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:09:46 GMT):<br/>
...: this brings us to the discussion of pre-prepare and how preprepare right now can prevent us from moving to the prepare stage
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:10:03 GMT):<br/>
...: so far we've been trying to move speculatively, but looking at other implementations it looks like we actually can do this
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:10:24 GMT):<br/>
...: these are the protocol change that we are looking at making in the next few weeks
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:11:52 GMT):<br/>
jlaw : asked some questions to clarify why the changes help.  Lovesh expounded on why the read/write and preprepare/prepare quorums need to be sized to provide the needed protocol guarantees.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:13:04 GMT):<br/>
@LoveshHarchandani will send out an email to the hyperledger-indy mailing list for further questions and discussion
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:14:59 GMT):<br/>
alex: added information on how some of these changes are going to proceed
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:15:48 GMT):<br/>
...: on improving the view change, our current approach is based on the catch-up process of asking about missing transactions which was only started on node startup.  Now during view change we trigger catch up.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:16:12 GMT):<br/>
...: it looks like the improvements to view change also leads to some good enhancements to the catch up code process
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:19:45 GMT):<br/>
jlaw: mentioned an optimization about how catch up can take care of any issues that could arise due to having what would currently be considered to be an insufficient number of pre-prepares
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:20:50 GMT):<br/>
lovesh: For the view change, we had a comprehensive document about the 4 approaches with discussion about the different options.  Can we make this public?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:21:05 GMT):<br/>
nage: so long as the reviewers know it is public, that sounds like a great idea
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:23:42 GMT):<br/>
luca: Is the provisional nodes network run by the provisional nodes hard enough to run a real load?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:24:11 GMT):<br/>
lovesh: it depends on what a resonable load is, but it general the answer is yes.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:24:43 GMT):<br/>
...: mostly we're looking to find the edge cases, like what happens with view changes under high load.  We've found some unexpected issues around those, and expect there might be more.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:25:04 GMT):<br/>
...: we have performance testing to help prove we can handle load, so please try things and report issues.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:26:00 GMT):<br/>
jlaw: the big reasons for these view change fixes were caused by this hardening process.  We found issues that needed these changes.  The current alpha network doesn't have all these fixes yet.  Those fixes should go out during this coming week.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:26:26 GMT):<br/>
alex: yes, the next release that is in a week should have these view change fixes
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:27:17 GMT):<br/>
...: there is a development flag that allows you to disable view changes, and when you do this you can do 10,000s of transactions.  Hopefully with the view change fixes we can get to that load without turning the view changes off.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:28:19 GMT):<br/>
jlaw: there are configurations called "unsafe" that disable characteristics and requirements of the protocol to help with testing.  These are labeled this because they are *very* unsafe and shouldn't ever be used in production, but allows us to test things faster (and identify if things proceed correctly when nodes don't behave).
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:30:27 GMT):<br/>
jlaw: there are known issues under certain conditions and loads where the alpha network won't survive, so don't throw tons of work at it without coordinating with other folks (#indy is a good place to coordinate those efforts)
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:31:37 GMT):<br/>
jlaw: there are some specialized scripts for testing, I wonder if all of those scripts are in the repo or if they are on someone's local machine.  If anyone has test or load scripts that can be shared, we should make sure they are in the repo.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:31:54 GMT):<br/>
alex: there are some good scripts in the sovrin-node repo (eventually to migrate to indy-node)
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:32:13 GMT):<br/>

</p>

markus: a trust anchor which a steward creates for themselves has a concept for creating identities for other folks, what is that called

jlaw: in Sovrin, because identifiers are pairwise, it feels a bit funny with stewards who have identifiers who are public (all the nodes should be publicly known)
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:40:30 GMT):<br/>
...: it is pairwise in your role, where your steward key has one id, but then when you create ids for other roles you use different IDs, so in this case you get a trust anchor ID that is different than the steward id
</p>

mike: we now have 9 validator nodes on the network, and we're debugging an issue on one of them where it disconnects periodically
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:42:20 GMT):<br/>
...: we are able to do transactions on the ledger, and there are several others who are qualified to be founding stewards.  We need to be encouraging them to get their nodes online.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:42:37 GMT):<br/>
...: we have them in Europe, South America, Africa and North America (so we are geographically diverse)
</p>

jlaw: do we have any status on the node in Singapore?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:43:27 GMT):<br/>
mike: we expect to ping the stewards who haven't brought their nodes online today (the Singapore node is in that list)
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:43:49 GMT):<br/>
jlaw: we'd like to share the location of those stewards and start some discussions about the diversity of the stewards
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:44:27 GMT):<br/>
...: to make sure there aren't too many that share the same security attributes (too many with one host like AWS, in any one country, etc)
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:44:46 GMT):<br/>
mike: we don't currently have a lot of visibility into some of those attributes, so we might also want to gather more of that type of data.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:45:31 GMT):<br/>
markus: how many nodes will we have, what is the plan?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:45:43 GMT):<br/>
mike: we have 16 approved, and are hoping to go up to somewhere around 19 for now
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:46:54 GMT):<br/>
jlaw: there are competing interests on the size of the pools.  As you add nodes you increase your security (greater number of discrete administrative domains that must be compromised to stop network progress), so larger is better, but the more nodes you have without the scaling architecture that we've modeled out implemented yet, the network will slow down the more nodes we add.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:47:29 GMT):<br/>
...: there are identity based subpool ideas and other things we've thought about to help with that, but the testing we're doing is also to help us find out where the "sweet spot" is for the number of validator nodes
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:47:42 GMT):<br/>
...: we suspect that the ideal might be 19 or so
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:48:13 GMT):<br/>
...: there are more and more requests for becoming a steward, so the numbers there will certainly grow.  Becoming a founding steward right now requires a vote.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:49:15 GMT):<br/>
jlaw: when we're talking about 16 or 19 nodes, we are talking about validator nodes, not about the concept of observer nodes (which isn't fully implemented yet)
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:49:46 GMT):<br/>
...: observer nodes function much like an edge cache and can answer read requests and we expect that there should be more of these distributed more widely.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:50:24 GMT):<br/>
...: observers also have reputation in terms of performance (also tied to who their stewards are), and can be used to help select new validator nodes going forward.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:51:23 GMT):<br/>
lovesh: we have been using a 32 byte cryptonym which allows you to treat your cryptonym as your DID, the functionality here is being cleaned up, so you will need to use the 16 byte id more correctly going forward
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:51:54 GMT):<br/>
jlaw: we are in the process of deprecating this before provisional go-live so we don't have to support both long term
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:53:25 GMT):<br/>

jlaw: I know several folks are working on GUIs
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:54:37 GMT):<br/>
...: there isn't really a reference GUI in the public repos right now, I don't know the answer to that, but it would be a great contribution
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:54:50 GMT):<br/>
...: adding one makes a lot of sense, it is a good question
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:55:44 GMT):<br/>
jlaw: I know Markus is doing some work, and Evernym has some proofs-of-concepts that involve GUI
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:56:14 GMT):<br/>
...: but we've heard bits and pieces about different folks in the community doing different things with existing GUIs that hope to integrate Sovrin as well
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:56:47 GMT):<br/>
...: we're not sure if any of those are public yet.  We would like it if there were some public open source reference GUIs
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Jun 2017 15:56:51 GMT):<br/>

@here We have an Indy Node WG meeting tomorrow (Thursday at 9:00 Mountain Time) here https://zoom.us/j/730665163.  We will be discussing consensus in Hyperledger Indy, the algorithms used and what makes Indy's consensus approach different.  We will also be discussing Go-Live status, and any other topics proposed by those who plan on being part of the call.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 05 Jul 2017 20:52:56 GMT):<br/>
Please post your questions or discussion topics here and I'll make sure they are added to the agenda.

<p><strong>Skorpion7777</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 12:25:41 GMT):<br/>
Hi guys, I have some questions concerning the alpha network and the installation guide. During my set up I ran into two problems (following those steps: https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-environments/blob/master/vagrant/training/vb-multi-vm/TestSovrinClusterSetup.md) First install I did was on my notebook. Everything went well and I managed to run 4 agents and 4 validators inside of virtual box (setup with vagrant). At this time my pc was pretty slowed down by all these VMs so I decided to pause them and only leave 1 validator and 1 agent activly running. This is the problem: when I log in to the agent with the `vagrant ssh agent01` command beeing in the _sovrin-environments-masters/vagrant/traning/vb-multi-vm_ I the login works fine. But when I want o continue the guide and use the `sovrin` command I get that it isn't installed.
</p>
<p><strong>Skorpion7777</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 12:32:37 GMT):<br/>
So I decided to give it another try. I rented a aws EC2 instance (with windows server). With more power than my notebook to run all agents and validators. Installation wasn't as smooth as on the notebook since i needed to use vagrant up agent/validator for every VM seperatly. The EC2 instance couldn't handle something like `vagrant up agent01 agent02` only one at a time. Anyways after having all units running I'm now running into the problem that I can't connect via ssh. I always get `ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer` I'm not quite shure where the problems are comming from, but I wanted to inform you. I'll be in the WG meeting later, so maybe we can discusse some issues. I'll also see if I have the time to try running the docker version before the meeting starts.

</p>
<p><strong>farooq_m_khan</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 15:11:51 GMT):<br/>
Answer from Steve: There is a auto-update system in place
</p>
<p><strong>farooq_m_khan</strong> (Thu, 06 Jul 2017 15:12:31 GMT):<br/>
For the update transaction to succeed however Stewards need to ensure the OS on there nodes is updated with OS patches

since we use the BFT which creates consensus and hence you need 4 nodes

Hi folks. One aws related question/comment. I used the CloudFormation Script (https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-environments/blob/master/cloudformation/training/SovrinCluster.json) but ran in to the problem that no mater which region I selected the ami's have been wrong. I've searched all public ami's and couldn't find any used in the cloudFormation script. Then I just edited the script and used a random ubuntu 16.04 ami (in my case ami-62498b0d ) that worked and the EC2 instances spinned up. Am I the only one who had this problem? 
</p>
<p><strong>tharmon</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 18:09:29 GMT):<br/>
The AMIs used in the CloudFormation script are produced by Ubuntu. They occasionally release new versions, which causes the old ones to be deprecated. Those who have previously used the deprecated AMIs are still allowed to continue. However, new users cannot see them. It appears that this has occurred, and I'll need to update the AMI list in the template.
</p>
<p><strong>tharmon</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 19:28:52 GMT):<br/>
Just updated the AMI list, as well as a few other items that I saw. There have been a number of changes recently in the code, and they may not yet be fully reflected in the templates. If you run into any issues with them, please DM me. Thanks.

@LoveshHarchandani and/or Kelly, on the Sovrin Trust Framework WG call someone asked what the service level objectives of the fully live (no longer provisional) network are/should be.  Do we have any current performance numbers or any objectives that we could talk about at the next Ledger WG call this Thursday?

Do we have any current performance numbers or any objectives that we could talk about at the next Ledger WG call this Thursday?
</p>
<p><strong>krw910</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 20:58:02 GMT):<br/>
@nage I am working through getting some get numbers now. Our focus was on stability and not performance for the initial release. I have several metrics I am working on gathering to see where we are now and then we can make goals on where we want to be. I also see different performance numbers than @LoveshHarchandani partially due to the difference in our setup and partially due to how the information is gathered. Most of my numbers have been from the clients view point which includes round trip latency with the client. With the transaction timestamp I can now start to measure how quickly those transactions are being recorded in the ledger. For example when sending 3500 transactions at once (10 Client at 350 each) the client view shows a throughput of 16 per second, but the timestamp in the ledger shows those were all written at 25 per second. I have seen as much as 69 per second, but it all depends on the load.

</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Tue, 01 Aug 2017 20:58:44 GMT):<br/>
would you be willing to go over some of this info on the Ledger WG call?

For those new to Hyperledger Indy and Sovrin, and as a reminder to all, we have developer calls every Thursday at 9:00 am US Mountain Time (the international time can fluctuate based on daylight savings time both in Utah and your local time).  We alternate between our Agent Working Group which concerns itself with the off-ledger interactions using Sovrin Identities, and the Ledger or Indy-Node Working Group which talks about the ledger itself.

Hey - trying to run the test script end to end using docker scripts. Currently setting up agents as per - https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0B4efUY1IocYwUERNNW5sekNTMUU.  On the step right before "Acme" in the script:


send ATTRIB dest=ULtgFQJe6bjiFbs7ke3NJD raw={"endpoint": {"ha": "10.0.0.6:5555", "pubkey": "5hmMA64DDQz5NzGJNVtRzNwpkZxktNQds21q3Wxxa62z"}}

Getting error: Error: client request invalid: InvalidClientRequest('dest should be added before adding attribute for it',)

I think the dest has been added in the previous steps.  I'm not sure I have the right IP:port, but I don't think that has come into play yet.

Any ideas?
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 21:07:11 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran The link given does not take me to the doc, so this will be a little general.  The steps needed are something like this:
1. As a STEWARD add Acme's TRUST_ANCHOR:
   sovrin> new key with seed 000000000000000000000000Steward1
   sovrin> send NYM dest=ULtgFQJe6bjiFbs7ke3NJD role=TRUST_ANCHOR verkey=~5kh3FB4H3NKq7tUDqeqHc1

2. As the TRUST_ANCHOR, add the ATTRIBs:
   sovrin> new key with seed Faber000000000000000000000000000
   sovrin> send ATTRIB dest=ULtgFQJe6bjiFbs7ke3NJD raw={"endpoint": {"ha": "<IP where agent will run>:5555", "pubkey": "5hmMA64DDQz5NzGJNVtRzNwpkZxktNQds21q3Wxxa62z"}}


From the error message, I think you missed step 1.
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 21:07:57 GMT):<br/>
That should be Faber's agent, not Acme's

Looking at the test code that run the tutorial, it looks like the the endpoint is just the ip:port?
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 21:13:22 GMT):<br/>
on one of the validators, what does "grep ULtgFQJe6bjiFbs7ke3NJD /home/sovrin/.sovrin/data/nodes/<ValidatorAlias>/transactions_sandbox/1 give you?
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 21:13:57 GMT):<br/>
You should see the ledger entry for the TRUST_ANCHOR
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 21:14:53 GMT):<br/>
if not, the steps in step 1 did not work

<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 21:17:12 GMT):<br/>
Another thing to check.  When you typed the "send NYM" instruction in the CLI, you should have seen "Nym ULtgFQJe6bjiFbs7ke3NJD added" as a response.

Where would I run that grep log command - I assume I exec into one of the docker containers - any of the nodes?  I'm on the client and not seeing the log file.
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 21:26:17 GMT):<br/>
Hm.  Your client is finding the validators and connecting to them.  But you are unable to successfully post a transaction to the ledger.  It is probably time to go splunking in the logs.  On the CLI node they will be in cli.log in the directory from which you ran sovrin.  Look for errors there first.  Then maybe you will need to look in a validator's logs.  They are at /home/sovrin/.sovrin/<NodeName>.log
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 21:27:15 GMT):<br/>
OK - so exec into the client container and look around there.
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 21:27:15 GMT):<br/>
Any validator will do
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 21:27:42 GMT):<br/>
Sorry - just to confirm - that's one of the nodes, right?

<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Thu, 17 Aug 2017 21:28:09 GMT):<br/>

Solved - self-inflicted. I had some issues getting the docker started, and had tweaked one of the scripts - node_build.sh.  Saw that in the node logs that (for example) Node 1 thought the other nodes were at 127.0.0.0, vs. the proper IPs.  Undid the hack and redeployed.  All is well.  @mgbailey  - thanks for the help.

Please find today's status of Indy-Node team:
- Multi-signature mechanism in consensus protocol: implementing BLS Signed State in Plenum.
- Issue with validator lagging behind the rest of nodes in pool: investigating the issue.
- Command line tool providing validator status: finished base implementation of node-side part, implemented formatted output, started to improve it for cases of incorrect/missed data.
- Lack of wallet migration mechanism: faced issues with incompatibility between different versions of jsonpickle, supported wallet migration from the intermediate state of renaming Link to Connection; added updating wallets directory name at cli/agent startup.
- Performance and load testing.
- Confirmation testing.
- Logging newly found bugs.

other features - see in spreadsheet
created monitoring tool for Stewards (CLI, installed w Node)
stats, info about node, current status
link in spreadsheet for video demo

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:11:14 GMT):<br/>
Fixed some stability problems, motion of nodes, primary nodes, improved some login, working on portability and maintainability tasks
clear exlplicit logs when something happens
Client Wallets and transaction files from before this release
Continue working on improving code, made changes, has code support, code validation
if code is not formatted for these rules, PR code will fail  - check in CI system
Working on states and state proofs
feature which will allow, to send request to one node, validator or observer, and get response to request
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:11:31 GMT):<br/>
possible due to state tree and signing of root, via BLS algorithm

</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:16:50 GMT):<br/>
Alex:
good comment, thanks
all BLS related stuff will provide sep crypto library
sep project, IndyCrypto
contain BLS algo
written in Rust
indySDK and IndyNode will work with BLS sigs
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:17:14 GMT):<br/>
adding more stuff, crypto and protocol related, this project good one for contribs from community related to crypto stuff

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:17:38 GMT):<br/>
Stephen: meant to replace CL algo or add to it?
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:18:40 GMT):<br/>
Nathan - CL (comenisch) is for building credentials (claims and proofs)
BLS for group signatures, w/o having to ask for S+1 nodes, for consensus and communicating consensus outside ledger
</p>

<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:30:06 GMT):<br/>
Nathan - discuss State Proofs

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:31:28 GMT):<br/>
Lovesh: State proofs and why important
Overview
as of now, if any clients want to trust a value on the ledger, asks a number of nodes (F+1)
confirms from greater than F nodes that something on the ledger has a specific value

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:32:09 GMT):<br/>
basically - let client create explicit proof
client requests one node, to provide a proof, that a particular key on the ledger has a particular value
ask a node "tell me the value of this DID, present proof that what you are saying is correct"
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:33:10 GMT):<br/>
from client and node perspective
proof that a particular state is valid
node holds merkle trie that stores key value pairs, and because network is signing merkle root periodically, once a proof is valid, and the state is signed by validators, the proof is correct for a particular value pair
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:33:35 GMT):<br/>
code present to verify proof, integration to do it between node and client, yet to be done
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:34:43 GMT):<br/>
change, receiving YES reply, and code needs to be aware of 
API level change in the SDK
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:34:58 GMT):<br/>
Vyacheslav
Not in SDK API, in NODE API
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:36:32 GMT):<br/>
signing of transaction
dont expect changes in SDK
Lovesh - you would have a proof coming right?
Alex - high level API, get "nym" transaction, would not change, hidden from user how we process replies from node and correct, USER only concerned with it result
internals of API may be changed, how check reply is correct, probably from high level POV what NODES ask for in reply, as of now always sent to whole pool of validators, in future, config and send request from some of the nodes

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:36:54 GMT):<br/>
just integration of States and State Proofs, how send replies, from validator pool, APIs should not change much for the end user
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:38:32 GMT):<br/>
Nathan - state proofs important from performance perspective, allows observer nodes, allow them to answer questions on behalf of ledger
READS spread out over larger set of computers, larger network
important piece of progress, and scale/drive adoption 
network handles higher load, support identities anchored on the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:38:54 GMT):<br/>
Alex - how these changes will be integrated is important
optional or mandatory
first version optional

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:39:10 GMT):<br/>
after some time may make features mandatory
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:39:34 GMT):<br/>
require every batch of transactions signed by all nodes, sufficient number of sigs from nodes
support feature iteratively to not break pool
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:39:46 GMT):<br/>
So ... will is it part of the network vision to allow organizations/people to run observer nodes with very low friction to join the network?
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:41:03 GMT):<br/>
Nathan - YES - tier of validator nodes, trust framework approved, publicly validate transactions 
observer nodes, signed to the trust framework, hot spares, full copy of ledger, promoted to the validator pool when needed
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:41:28 GMT):<br/>
achieve diffuse trust
no too many reps from any one geography, industry, political jurisdiction, hosting platform, etc. 
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:41:49 GMT):<br/>
not effect consensus overall, or if so it wouldnt impact fast enough to prevent sovrin from reacting
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:42:35 GMT):<br/>
:thumbsup: 
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:43:38 GMT):<br/>
easy to obtain copy of ledger as ledger is updated, closer to doing large #s of queries
run an observer node, get a complete copy
copies of ledger is healthy as a whole, easier to audit, prove people are validating, following TF
with high volume of queries, obfuscation, preserving privacy of all on network
closer to center, faster updates
at edges, can still build rep to be reliable node, move to center over time, increase participation
indy that is not Sovrin, arch differently - only showing sovrin as global public utility for identiy as an example
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:45:06 GMT):<br/>
Nathan
Sig schemes, code changes, node side, SDK impacts
Open discussion - questions welcome

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:45:45 GMT):<br/>
John(BC) - curious about peer to peer comms
once two peers discover each other, est secure connection, where crypto TLS and DID TLS happening?

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:45:59 GMT):<br/>
Nathan
Agent to agent comms in the Agent WG
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:47:22 GMT):<br/>
LEdger serves as distributed PKI
everyone has ID, pairwise ID (pub key you can check on ledger, see if still who they say they are), consensus means you have confidence that the consent of the owner to change key
instead of cert authority chains and rely on root source of trust, use DLT as root of trust
handshake with any party, without disclosing more info
enables diff parties to do secure comms, IOT, individuals exposing facets of ID
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:47:41 GMT):<br/>
nutshell - 2 kinds
1. Agent to Agent comms
2. Talk to the ledger

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:49:13 GMT):<br/>
2. is simpler
Node side - genesis trasactions, validating BLS in state proofs, and make sure party is auth
in 1. Agent to Agent - take CurveZMQ, common protocol for dist system
connect or talk to agent, this is my ID and this is the ID I want to talk to
dont disclose details to malicious eavesdropper
no correlations of point to point comms
John has his DID for Nathan and Nathan has his own for John

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:51:48 GMT):<br/>
no one else knows about them
protect user to make sure info isnt leaked
2 ways
curveZMQ - pairwise feature
johns agent in cloud server - it is this ID I am trying to talk to (server sends right to John, no one else knows)
TLS handshake
key material on ledger - present certs, complete handshake, iETF compliant
both techniques work due to oracle of ledger
encrypted ? hints, but because we have an oracle of a DLT, can create key or look up key to encrypt SNI data, full end ot end encrypted handshake
Source ID address, talked to this ID Address
if an agency can forward traffic to another entity on Sovrin, flow of traffic is not sufficient to build correlation models
censorship resistance use cases
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:51:55 GMT):<br/>
discover who is talking to whom
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:53:09 GMT):<br/>
John(BC) - layer 2, 3 monitoring
Nathan - challenge
pairwise pub keys, priv keys, why not endpoints
IP addresses are mapped to phys world
either go down path of building onion network, or funct to build deniability that you need
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:53:37 GMT):<br/>
couple of routing features, excrypted SNI part is sufficient, see where people want to go from there
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:54:09 GMT):<br/>
Nathan - reach outto Sam Curren, Farouk Khan, or Mike Lodder - love to discuss it

Eric Welton
looking at SDK
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:55:32 GMT):<br/>
touch real quick on relationship b/w genesis transactions and runtime when connecting to ledger
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 15:55:43 GMT):<br/>
is idea Genesis is dynamic or fixed for say the Sovrin network?
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 16:00:34 GMT):<br/>
Lovesh: seed file, getting with codebase is a seed file to connect other nodes
EricW: would be varying that a lot under testing
but outside of testing, that's a fixed set of transactions
constantly growing, not fixed, wouldn't have to use the one that comes with codebase
test genesis files

ErickW - going thru SDK - first hurdle, confirm und the seed file defines a network, one particular seed file, but if running a priv or nested would have diff seed file, that whole ledger defined by one set of genesis transactions - quite correct
might contain ten nodes
discovery - client, connects to 10 nodes, client 

Nathan - from client perspective, genesis block might get updated over time: some leave, others take place, need to grab block and ask for updates, to whatever the current state is

simple - get initial state, connect to network, rooted in the blockchain all the way back to initial, should be able to proceed
first block on the ledger, was a long signing ceremony, to verify root of trust was correct, audit way to package manager or source of SDK

EricW - great, matches understanding, wanted to mention, particular use case in Feb was running a sep ind network, example given something like the hong kong monetary authority, having 100-110 validators corresponding to each group w/in HKMA, sep genesis transactions cloistered from rest of Sovrin
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 16:05:09 GMT):<br/>
diff set of genesis transaction, only case where a client would want 2 independent instances
get comfortable with
talkin to a protected network, brokering DID and DDO exchange between both
appropriate facade from regulated environment to public environ

Nathan - when you shard, allow all transactions to flow from priv to pub, maintain subset of data locally for jurisdictional control
just like OS trust more than 1 root CA, maybe have SDK trust more than one Genesis Block, check sig on whatever is appropriate
community resolver tool from DIF

EricW
the SDK would only ever need to have one genesis block, spin up two instances in close proximity
added complexity of SDK not worth it
Exporting data to public ledger, specifically the request to avoid
contrary to spirit of sovrin, but real concern from reg agencies - this is hong kong data - doesn't leave the island

Nathan - self sovereign, control over priv key side
in current model, most wont get it, more experienced the hope is they will be shown reality over time

EricW - going back to Dec Jan
if remember, more of a "I can't sell this upstream when there is data crossing national boundaries, like idea of parity
like idea of internet of identity
same infrastructure on both sides
lightweight NATing
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 31 Aug 2017 16:06:48 GMT):<br/>

Hello,
As an exercise to improve our understanding of the process, I would like to add a new agent to Faber, Acme, and Thrift in the Alice story. The Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) agent would:
* on creation,
- write a (simplistic) INAC-Status claim definition consisting of:
> ssn [str] _(wrong on many levels for Canada, but plough through)_
> status [boolean]
- create a request for Alice to connect
- store an INAC-Status claim for Alice
* on bootstrap,
- get or bootstrap the INAC-Status claim definition defined above
- make Alice's claim available.

A few questions arise, regarding magic values.

From `sovrin_client/test/agent/faber.py`:
---------------------------------------
* in `create_faber()`,
- `agent.invites`,
> is `b1134a647eb818069c089e7694f63e6d` a nonce?
> can `openssl rand -hex 16` suffice to generate such a nonce, or is there a more native way in practice?

* in `bootstrap_faber()`,
- re: ID `schema_id`, `FuN98eH2eZybECWkofW6A9BKJxxnTatBCopfUiNxo6Z` is Faber's DID.
> How is it generated?
> Is it only in the `sovrin>` client that the steward writes Faber as a trust anchor?
- re: coro call to `bootstrap_schema()` -- the primes `p` and `q` come from `../constants.py`.
> is it OK to use `openssl prime -generate -bits 1024` to generate both?
> Do `p` and `q` need to be related somehow on the ed/curve25519 curve or is it enough that they are 1024 bits (and distinct)?

From `sovrin_client/test/agent/acme.py`:
--------------------------------------
* in `bootstrap_acme()`, the code re-uses the same `primes["prime1"]` to bootstrap the `Job-Certificate` schema as `bootstrap_faber()` in `faber.py` uses for its `Transcript` schema. Is this safe? What are `p` and `q` for??

Disclaimer: I have a degree in crypto, but it's from 1993-94 when elliptic curve crypto was new, so I don't know all the modern tricks. So you can get pretty technical with me, but I can't claim to understand all the results in depth.

Possible Issue: When trying to follow the Alice/Faber story, first step is to ./pool_start.sh. This seems to work from that scripts output point of view. However, if one enters the node1 docker container and does an 'ls -la .sovrin' there is no Node1.log file indicating node1 did not start up.

Here is the node2.log file output ...

Normally, I can stop the pool, restart it and node1 starts up fine.

Not sure if this is important or not.

Slava: most important bug , found by Andrew 
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 15:10:39 GMT):<br/>
Slava - also important, limitation of message length depending on transaction type, now not only generic msg length limitation but also smart limitation
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 15:11:51 GMT):<br/>
Victor: - can't create large transaction because it is not supposed to be large
can inc amount of size for overall batch of transactions while limiting volume to prevent 
mechanism 1 limits size of message, another limits by type, provides control over msg lengths, limits are configurable 
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 15:13:13 GMT):<br/>

Indy SDK achievements
1. creation of dedicated Indy lib and repo on HL github
purpose to provide crypto for hyperledger indy project
for this lib, 3 diff interfaces: native C interface to create diff wrappers for languages
provides RUST interface
provides Python wrapper
implemented DLS signatures, create multisig and verify multisignatures
library for state proofs 
working together with Indy Node team, release funct together in Indy Node and Indy SDK
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 15:16:27 GMT):<br/>
some changes in Python wrapper of LibIndy
for now possible to use Python wrapper, most common version 
installation will be simplified, dont need additional repos
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 15:17:01 GMT):<br/>
enhancement of ? wrapper
possible to do custom wallet types
code is finished but in review and avail in next version of Indy SDK
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 15:19:04 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 15:22:04 GMT):<br/>
One thing to mention, in upcoming sprint, whole series of tasks to do to graduate from incubation in Hyperledger
branding of folders and files, codebase works against Indy (not Sovrin), tasks for security and general cleanup
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 15:22:45 GMT):<br/>
Node codebase - folders and files with Sovrin in path name, need to refactor for Indy instead
files structure needs work
data files need work, placed on system in a a way to make it difficult
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 15:24:07 GMT):<br/>
working on effort to enumerate where all files are on disc, config files, org in such a way that is clean and logical, clear which files belogn to whcih network
create test network? move that to production without loss
make cleaner and more logical, on SDK side makes more sense to have more than one indy network, might move from instance-test -network to production
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 14 Sep 2017 15:25:48 GMT):<br/>
think we can make the process smoother and avoid mistakes, state files or directories that have data that we dont need to get rid of but not use for a period of time
slava and  team working on organization, posting links on Rocketchat
CHANGES HAVE SOME AMOUNT OF RISK ASSOCIATED
hoping to get feedback on final destination of files and folders, have migration scripts as part of the upgrade, no disruption to the core of the system
bring it up here - you may have written tools or monitoring or logic that depends on certain files in cert locations, we want to avoid disruptions along the way

We've been struggling with trying to get Indy-Node instances running in an OpenShift (Kubernetes) environment.  The main challenge has been because of Indy-Node's use of systemd and running as root. In thinking about solutions, the use of systemd becomes unnecessary if an assumption is made that Indy-Node will run in a container-ized environment. If you assume containers, the container is "the service", the container manager (eg. Kubernetes, etc) manages robustness, scaling, etc. and so having Indy-Node running without systemd becomes viable.  We think it would be a lot easier to test, more supportable and deployment becomes a lot easier (e.g. all the arguments for containers).  It does require that Stewards run a container environment, but these days, that is becoming the norm for most organizations, let alone those forward thinking enough to be running Sovrin.

Thoughts on that?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Wed, 20 Sep 2017 09:41:40 GMT):<br/>
I think there are some security reasons why it's assumed that Stewards doesn't use containers now.
The Node itself doesn't require root, it's run from 'sovrin' user. It's the node-control-tool-service that requires root. This service is responsible for auto updates (POOL_UPGRADE txn), so it stops node service, performs update (apt-get), and restarts the node service.
</p>
<p><strong>gudkov</strong> (Wed, 20 Sep 2017 11:02:27 GMT):<br/>
From my point of view, indy node must support deployment on different platforms and different nodes must be deployed different ways. Otherwise one security issue in Kubernetes or OS that is used as base for docker image can affect the whole pool. Also hypervisor based environments (actually the most of SaaS based container and virtual environments) can have problems with crypto random numbers generation. 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 20 Sep 2017 14:32:31 GMT):<br/>
Sounds good. Not the end of the world - just something we're grappling with.  We're adjusting the deployment to work with openshift and it looks like (fingers crossed!) it will work without systemd.  We'll see what we have to change and see if that is worth contributing back or if it will lead to useful suggestions for adjustment.  Our current purpose is to just run a test network, but it will give us some experience if we do go the Steward path.
</p>
<p><strong>darrell.odonnell</strong> (Wed, 20 Sep 2017 16:04:01 GMT):<br/>
I'm a bit too high-level to know definitely. We've had a few projects shift between systemd and other daemon running tools so I can't see what they would have done to block that.
</p>
<p><strong>tharmon</strong> (Wed, 20 Sep 2017 17:21:46 GMT):<br/>
There are a couple of different things going on here, from my perspective.

1)  There is a big difference between running a validator in a testing environment and running on in a production environment. The current thought is that for a number of reasons a production validator should run either on bare metal or on a fairly beefy VM. So, there's a bias towards that in the coding. For those running on the Sovrin Network, the Sovrin Provisional Trust Framework (https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SovrinProvisionalTrustFramework2017-03-22.pdf) Technical Requirements basically mandate this (Section 7.1). That said, we would certainly like your participation in the working groups to discuss how containers may become a possibility in the future (ping @nage). That's also one of the best places to get the deep technical reasoning behind why certain decisions have been made.

2)  The environments provided in evernym/sovrin-environments aren't part of the official release, but instead are part of a community effort to help each other build up testing environments. They certainly lag behind what is produced, and also occasionally diverge in other ways (though we try to get them back in sync as quickly as possible). I suspect that's where the running as `root` is coming from. That's not how it's suppose to be done. With this, we invite as many contributions as possible to help make the environments provided here better and easier to use. The goal of this particular repository is to provide methods to quickly set up working pools for testing--which is right in line with @swcurran's purpose.

Big point, @swcurran, I love your interaction and pushing the community to make things better for everyone.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 20 Sep 2017 17:43:10 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the response - especially pointing out the details in section 7.1 - interesting stuff.  The High Availability needs are indeed different than a "typical" app we deal with, so the non-container world does make sense - at least for now.  FYI - the good news is that our approach for our test network is working and we're miles ahead of where we were yesterday :-).  We're consolidating what's been done and we'll see if we have things to contribute back to the evernym/sovrin-environments codebase.

Indy SDK
State proofs and BLS multi sig
code implemented
displayed in pull request, merging soon into Indy Node and Plenum packages

Also - incubation tasks
similar tasks for SDK (renaming, CI and CD efforts - similar to Indy Node repos)
remove binary artifacts to community repos
only exception is making compatible repos for java wrapper
plan in the future - move to maintenance
perform bug fixes
use different cure for BLS Multisig and BLS

Nathan
Indy crypto lib has been changed to use more secure type 3 pairing curve
move SDK over
official supported curve for anoncreds going forward
open to community - 
if people have claims they have made that require compatibility - please speak up 
most claims in ecosystem on PoC projects, reissue in future
if you know it will be disruptive please let us know (here, mailing list, direct, rocketchat, etc.)

one of next plans in future sprint to fully get rid of Py anoncreds and client, switch to INDY SDK
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 28 Sep 2017 15:16:39 GMT):<br/>
implement CLI in Indy SDK

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 28 Sep 2017 15:17:52 GMT):<br/>
of course, important thing - take into account current wallets people may have, provide some kind of migration from old wallets ot new one by Indy SDK
use Indy SDK for Indy Node
test time dependency
use Indy SDK to test how pool works, after items done
deprecate Python code in anoncreds as well
can fix current python anoncreds to use new curve as well
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 28 Sep 2017 15:18:47 GMT):<br/>

further plans, next thing, agent-agent communication
more for SDK not ledger
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 28 Sep 2017 15:19:35 GMT):<br/>
other plans, important features - DDO support for DID, revocation support (supported in anoncreds code and protocol) but not supported in ledger in terms of transactions (we have schema and claim definition to store for primary claims but not revocation keys yet)
</p>

indy crypto library as basis for shared crypto library for Hyperledger
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Thu, 28 Sep 2017 15:21:40 GMT):<br/>
going forward does it make sense that there could be more that one crypto function supported within the ecosystem and therefore verifiable claims may need to be associated with specific crypto algorithm as time passes?
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 28 Sep 2017 15:22:29 GMT):<br/>
across Indy and could be shared across other projects at Hyperledger as well
interest from Sawtooth folks, validate creds with claims and proofs, threshold sig implmeentaiton for BLS, other ZK crypto primitives, ED 25519 curve, more useful way, better for ledger to consume than Apache-Milagro crypto lib
breaking up the org of the library, where crypto primitives in lib
might decide to break into file system and network comms and one for serialization/data formats
</p>

Jljordan42's question
Answer - yes, possibly (quantum computing use case, something to harden further), still need to validate and exchange proofs from before - business ceases to exist and still use claim issued, but 
right now no significant use no need to carry forward 
rather drop from being supported and not carry old version
do want to support multple versions of protocol, look to add

CHanges to how agent-agent comms can occur
found pairwise curve zmq proto for agent-agent has difficulty integrating into app environments (android, iOS) and mechanics of handshake
- going to libsodium based encryption, HTTP or HTTPS and sign over that channel to allow agent comms between environments with less work and avoid hurdles in the past
Indy SDK milestone

QUESTIONS?

<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 28 Sep 2017 15:42:24 GMT):<br/>
KELLY - Upgrade issues
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 28 Sep 2017 15:44:30 GMT):<br/>
did an upgrade of provisional network, main issue found, when setting up live pool, defaults are set to a sandbox pool
need to override in Sov config settings
upgrade runs migration script, as root, conffig files as sov user, failing on the upgrade
there was a bug fixed after provisional where system was in upgrade loop, pool bouncing, got it fixed and pushed into package, up and running now, gone through and addressed issue, dress up things for upgrade
basic issue 

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 28 Sep 2017 15:44:49 GMT):<br/>
NATHAN
In JIRA there are a whole set of tickets named "upgrade"
and bug fixes to address issues
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 28 Sep 2017 15:45:50 GMT):<br/>
more difficult to have confusion on how update settings worked
rearranging config files
3 sep config files - user, system daemon and global
think some will help reduce risk of this happening again, easier for scripts to find settings in question, other fixes related to make it easier to handle and manage that part of the code
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 28 Sep 2017 15:46:08 GMT):<br/>
more to discuss in 2 weeks as those tickets come into scope of work that people are actively persuing

JAMES WAUGH
quick question
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 28 Sep 2017 15:48:55 GMT):<br/>
interested in the crypto lib, collab between Indy and Sawtooth

NATHAN
collab in early stages
really like working with Mic, interesting ideas of integration points that make sense, see which bear fruit
try things
in particular, secure execution environments are super relevant to key management
lot of integration team specifically related to how key management can function, make sure keys cant be stolen or phished
Sawtooth generally - data streams that can use external validation
Verifiable Claim to allow you to see or interact with data that is on a different ledger
Data Stream of supply chain data, on an enterprise ledger, grant access to others based on their sovereign ID, give claims, have proof of ability to see data

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 28 Sep 2017 15:49:46 GMT):<br/>
Ledger able to grant access to info, allow transact to occur based on approval distributed
instead of Fabric CA and you can depend on external root of trust w/o haveing to contact CAs or have centralized infrastructure
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 28 Sep 2017 15:50:08 GMT):<br/>
remains to be seen how much work would be put there
interested in those who want to do PRs

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JSSezTZ6Fon_cWN0XYju9ASjfSSOkzLXsc4v6MPli6Y/edit?usp=sharing
Core and SDK team
Core team working on continue on State Proofs
in CLI too
CLI can work with nodes with sep state proofs
backward compatibility for state proofs with all clients
state proof changes backwards compatible
continue work on multiple directories and layout
fresh install looks fine, prepping integration script for new nodes
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 15:13:22 GMT):<br/>
integration work in progress
continue work on rebranding of code to indy
wallet now can use diff keys
implemented Libindy in Sovrin  packages
new nodes added to pools
SDK team - state proofs
changes in state proofs provided by core team
also additional calls to wallet
sep key rotation in wallet
supported new calls

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 15:14:30 GMT):<br/>
auth and anon encryption from keys from ledger
implemented new methods to host info on pairwise connections between wallets
multiple bug fixes, indy SDK team working on design of new agent-agent approach
allow more simple way to communicate between agents, plan to get results in next sprint and implementation
any questions ?

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 15:14:52 GMT):<br/>
Nathan - versioning?

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 15:16:00 GMT):<br/>
Slava - State Proofs finished, only problem to create production version w/ sep state proofs is providing way to update current pool
plan to implement migration during this sprint, hope soon there will be new release with sep state proofs
support in Node, SDK and CLI

Daniel - explaiing what State Proofs do and why important
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 15:17:07 GMT):<br/>
Nathan  - State Proofs - read req off ledger, will come with group sig from all nodes and that is the signed state from all parties in the network, when you get that back from one node you asked question of, verify that is the state of the ledger from F+1 nodes to assure answer is not malicious and ascertain state of the ledger of all
trust answer you get back
2 things:
ID is read-heavy use case (more reads than writes)
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 15:17:44 GMT):<br/>
2. allow building observer node pool - allow smaller # of validators and lager pool of observer nodes
high query node can run it against a observer, 
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 15:18:51 GMT):<br/>
Daniel - clarify adding support for state proofs are returned but also adding verification of state proofs so when indy sdk is called to get question answered, the signature is tested
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 15:19:30 GMT):<br/>
Nathan - yes, thats the understanding
Slava - good explanation
State proof is signed multi-sig, from each nodes and client of pool, verifies all nodes signed this proof

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 15:21:39 GMT):<br/>
Daniel
timing for state proofs? protocol versioning?

Nathan - versioning for protocol and numbering of transactions
imp change to evolve an installed ledger

Slava - current vision, comms with node, will introduce version of comms protocol, 1 version and also need to intro version of transaction
means that transaction, semantically response to some general x related to version
how nodes comm w/ each other and with IndySDK
for moment we have implemented audit-only version to comm protocol, only reason for change - current responses with state proofs arent compatible with old clients
for now the clients that want to use state proof func.t should put version of comm protocol (#1 for now) 
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 15:21:54 GMT):<br/>
if version isnt provided, regular results w/o state proofs (consensus approach)
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 15:22:03 GMT):<br/>
so responses are valid
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 15:22:30 GMT):<br/>
plans to have backwards compatible, changes to protocol, use new version
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 15:23:09 GMT):<br/>
Nathan - add here, in very long term essentially allows to revise comms protocol, can show/test if they are compatible
important to diffuse trust because you dont want a point of failure in any point of system, trust it as much as possible

</p>

Daniel - anyone volunteering to be docker maven
have an image
dont have a higher level construct/team of images all together with a single command
lacking/not rocket science
if we tackle - someone will fig out how to make it work, check in, announce success, 1-2 months later, some need to tweak, will have forgotten, not centerail to thinking and interest
wouldn't naturally realize maintenance to do there
someone who cares about docker enough to own it (supervise, build, maintain)
Daniel - never done - pick up a new environment and framework and ecosys for Indy to behave as first class constructs - ongoing maintenance not one time task
upgrading GSG as a onetime task and not ongoing, neglected, and got stale

Nathan - imp point about open source in general - if you want a funct, please come help
get the support community is willing to maintain

</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 15:44:37 GMT):<br/>
daniels point - someone in community who wants docker images to be maintained, it wont happen
</p>

Make a call out to the mailing list on features people might want to see


[11:49] 
letting people know the direction heading, somethign s people want to participate in, can get started sooner rather than later
has seen some callouts on the mailing list of diff projects for roadmaps


[11:49] 
document it in a way that makes it available to people


[11:49] 
pointers to where tey can look for add’l info, involved in particular piece


[11:49] 
anything to help und where to go will help


[11:52] 
Stephen Curran BC - Verified Claims
Nathan - have it with anoncreds, very much ledger specific to what we are doing, working on standard w/ W3C, more a JSON format, changes to anoncreds to asjust things, need to suggest things back to W3C (schemas and proofs v claims) - point where it makes sense, supporting W3C ver claims and work with them to move to priv preserving arch
Lot like DID/DDO thing
Indy supports, do today, do future, adjusting agent code and sdk level


[11:56] 
Tony Rose - blockchain enthusiast, studying space
started role with Juvo.com (spelling?)
financial inclusion and digital identity using televoms as channel to the consumers
doing study on identity
help guide them
when they think about digital id and credit profile to unbanked, more than collecting data into a database and move them upstream, more than connecting to bank for larger loan, opportunity to give them an identity that has more utility
brrings him to INDY
at HL Hackfest in January (where first considered)
first opp to help develop a product to take advantage of these capabilities
looking forward to participating
no questions yet
spent all week reading SOv whitepapers, techs launched, how do we put together a prototype
6 month engagement, do protos
</p>

<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 12 Oct 2017 16:00:11 GMT):<br/>
Sovrin foundation started work on token support
method to help reduce spam
method to create incentives to give issuers data to id owners within ecosystem to be paid for sharing more broadly
some refactoring work in Node and Plenum to make sure the config ledgers are in the right places to extend Indy ledger in interesting ways
Lovesh and Brent and others putting on agenda for Node in next few weeks to help make it possible

@ashcherbakov is giving an update on the end of the current sprint and the start of the next one
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:05:58 GMT):<br/>
The next sprint is devoted to merging in state proofs and part of the incubation tasks around file/folder refactoring and rebranding to Indy
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:06:18 GMT):<br/>
... we should have a new stable release with these things and some bug fixes for upgrade and some code improvements for CI/CD and so on
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:06:39 GMT):<br/>
... This is the status for the first part of the Indy Node part of the sprint, for the SDK part of the sprint
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:06:56 GMT):<br/>
... the main tasks for the past sprint were to design and create a new Agent-to-Agent API based on libsodium

[ the transport agnostic encryption tools we talked about some at IIW ]
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:07:50 GMT):<br/>
... the main point of communication was related to DID, but now we have a generic key management approach for agent to agent and signing and verification with just keys that don't necessarily have DIDs (unanchored keys)
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:08:52 GMT):<br/>
... this gives us peer to peer or point to point communication when you have keys for each part
</p>
<p><strong>codenamedmitri</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:09:17 GMT):<br/>
question - are you using any sort of tweaks or changes to the DID spec, in Indy?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:09:24 GMT):<br/>
... you can prepare a message to be sent using libsodium sealed-boxes and authentication encryption
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:09:41 GMT):<br/>
ack @codenamedmitri's question
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:09:58 GMT):<br/>
... the security is done on the prepare message level
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:10:18 GMT):<br/>
... then you can send the message over any transport
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:10:46 GMT):<br/>
... there is a link to a demo describing these changes.  They are not yet in stable, finishing this new api and getting it merged should happen early in this next sprint
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:11:02 GMT):<br/>
... along with the state proof and multisignature support
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:11:14 GMT):<br/>
[ see the spreadsheet link shared earlier for details ]
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:11:42 GMT):<br/>
... there is also an update in the wallet implementation to use SQLCypher by default
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:11:49 GMT):<br/>
... that should be merged in this next sprint
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:11:53 GMT):<br/>
( for the SDK code )
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:12:21 GMT):<br/>
... the agent to agent API based on ZeroMQ will be deprecated in favor of the libsodium boxing api described
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:13:12 GMT):<br/>
[ because the pairwise-curveZMQ version of ZeroMQ we were using didn't allow agents to talk to agents using the owners keys without authenticating an agent's authorization to talk on behalf of the identity owner ]
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:13:28 GMT):<br/>
@Sean_Bohan can we take a look at the demo?

@Sean_Bohan many of the community were at the Internet Identity Workshop, it was good to talk to everyone there, does anyone in attendance want to give a report?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:20:12 GMT):<br/>
@darrell.odonnell A big take away for me was the biggest part of a self-sovereign solution was governance, and that really sets Indy and Sovrin apart
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:20:42 GMT):<br/>
... I'm pleased that the framework is so solid.  Additionally @swcurran and @jljordan_bcgov 's demo was awesome!
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:21:23 GMT):<br/>
@jljordan_bcgov It was good to be there and meet everyone.  We learned a lot and got good feedback on our model.  As for the tech, there is some DID/DDO Verifiable Claims stuff is very interesting to us and we're looking for that to achieve consensus.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:21:39 GMT):<br/>
... seeing the activities in the DIF was interesting and we're really hopeful for interoperable implementations
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:22:09 GMT):<br/>
... we really want to improve the simplicity of adopting Indy, so seeing the CLI and SDK come into alignment and become easier to on-board will be important.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 15:22:23 GMT):<br/>
... there are confusing discussions to be had about what you have to do in the CLI vs the SDK
</p>

Lot of thing that have to happen to make things easier to use
Finding most stuck on Agent-Agent comms
Rethinking it
Always thought of useing TLS
TLS 1.2 and earlier dont do diffie-helman earlier enough
Revelase relationship between one reltationhip and another
TLS3 does
Pairwise curvezmq has a real hard time doing agent auth
Dont want to auth keys to agents themselves, but to identities, make sure agent is auth to act for identity  in question
Uphill battle with CurveZMQ
Backed off and instead building API based off of auth encryption inside of LibSodium
Using boxing and unboxing APIs makes sense
Dont have to change threading model that works (node.js, PHP, Py, Java) - do what native platform wants and get secure piont to point
When we do move to DID TLS
Terms of maturity of the ecosystem - bumpy ride, best option moving forward
Questions:
Dmirti - experience in semantic web world
Used classic TLS certs to ID DIDs
b/c faced with same problem, needed to ID Agents to do same thing, “auth on behalf of” terminology
Introducing slight edit to DID spec - not only auth DID holder, but also other agents on behalf of that holder
Nathan - had that discussion
Same curran has a goog doc with DID TLS spec
Tradeoffs - how to articulate agent
If you have to tell the ledger who the agent is, you could correlate mult keys
Idea - generic delegation, vs agent delegation
Any did looks the same as any agent
USE CASE - hospital and bank want to give ID on a sys like Sov
Bank = finance APIs, hospita - medical APIS
Tie them together
Might simply delegate different endpoints to different places
Might need endpoiint that stitches together APIs
Might say “doctors office, you can be in charge of keys for med API, dont need to be Self-Sov in that case, sign right auths for agent to respond on my behalf
Not the business of who you are talking to
Like to look at WebID examples Dmitri mentioned
Fairly common pattern for any sys using mutual authentication
Onramps or shortcuts? Pick up and use to make DID TLS happen faster
DMIRTI - 
No extensions to TLS itself
Load semantic web equiv of DIDs
Look for claims
Nathan
Discussed Indy SDK
Crypto code in Indy SDK drops down to Shared Crytpo lib
Break apart file system from SDK from pieses that do data format and protocol piece
Run protocol mech via something like Intel SGX
Differential privacy if claims and proofs from Sov could be done w/in that kind of environment
When you try to trust someone elses TPM, trust assurances can be spooked or faked, only trust own, lot of blinding steps alrady in anoncreds protocol
Pointed to parts of spec that have usable bits of crypto

How that helps over time
Roadmap - agent WG call
Alot of features pretty far out - focused on making onramp and developer impedence issues are improved
Few pieces of toolset where new devs getting hung up, technical things we can do to make it easier
Prirotizing dev onboarding that dev new features
Welcoem to add yourselves into the sprint!
Pull into team standups and people working on overlapping bits of code
Use asynch comms as we can 
Resources available
Talked a lot about things worked on in var standards orgs
Need ot make more clear - lot of things inside of DIF and other ID platforms that we want to see standardized, beyond Sov and Ind we dont know what the right approach is yet
Indy - approach for privacy, trust, ver claims
Bite sized standards - ZKPs, selective disclosure, pairwise IDs, DID Specs, Agent APIs (extensible), Identity hub for discovering agents
Some pieces we arent sure about: linked data, schema info in ledger vs. higher level, REST resources based approaches of ID hubs, some might disagree w/
As an ecosystem we want people trying those things if they believe in them
If somoene wants to try out, see how it works, happy to merge if experiments work out
When you look at specs, not every codebase will support everything in spec
Cpmpatibility problems, new ecosystem, try things, ok if we dont all support entirely, but we need to see if things work
Lessons - adopt standards, pls dont go dark, talk about, “hey i want to do restful ID hubs on Sov” - you can talk to people here 
DMITRI
DID Auth? Mentioned a couple of times
Is there any sort of doc, or spec or is it implicit “read the code”
NATHAN
Started on a couple of times
Dont believe there is a coherent doc 
Closest thing in terms of TLS is Sam Currans DID TLS
UML diagrams, swimlane pics of how the LibSodium approach works (Farouk - worked a lot making it clear and documenting parts of use case for claims and proofs
Share with community next week
CHRISTIANS
Experience w/ OpenID Connect and OAuth
OpenID Connect and libraries and dealt with extremem edge cases in that world
How to go abotu getting VerClaims from Sovrin integrated w/ federation
Seems like possibly a path that might drive certain kinds of dev adoption or interest
Floorboard engineers in big corps to find ways to justify using small pieces of Sov
Onboarding path - tooling
NATHAN
Christian and Dmitri talked a little at IIW
Khagesh Sharma - worked on integrating OAuth and OpenID COnnect
RWoT Archives (RWoT 4) - what web auth spec might look like
Most folks working on infrastructure level stuff before we came that far
D & C could probably make a lot of process quickly

Open up to the floor

use GitHub to post user stories and post dollar value
"help us w/ this user story"
vendors can manage agile teams and so forth
interesting to use OAuth capability of GitHub to bring GitHub ID into Sov as a mechanism
way of understanding their contributions
Nathan
Keybased doing proof of control
Notary can issue a ver claim that you can prove you use a particular account or service
Super interesting
DMITRI
interesting mechanism we could take inspiration from

<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 12:32:41 GMT):<br/>
Hi @prmdmshra.
What OS do you use? As of now, it's guaranteed to work on Ubuntu only.

Look like you need to install Charm-Crypto (have a look at https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-anoncreds/blob/master/setup-charm.sh)

Also for what purpose are you installing indy-node? Installatiomn from pip is not a recommeneded way.
Please have a look at the documentation (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/README.md)
- if you want to contribute to the code and configure development environment, then please have a look at https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/setup-dev.md
- If you want a ready-to-use pool, then please have a look at `How to Install a Test Network` section in README
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-node?msg=SgubtTh7turErysd4) @ashcherbakov 
I am trying to setup the Indy network to demostrate a PoC for Birth certificate registration.
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 14:01:28 GMT):<br/>
ok, then you probably need to have a look to indy-sdk (the client part containing also anonymous credentials logic).
I think it should be sufficient to install a pool from Docker (see docs in indy-sdk or links above)
</p>

@nbrempel on a validator node you can run "sudo -i -u sovrin validator-info -v" for an overview that includes the sizes of the 3 ledgers in Indy. (2 ledgers are metadata.  
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 21:58:05 GMT):<br/>
the one you want to see is "domain")
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 21:58:46 GMT):<br/>
To inspect the actual contents, on the validator run "sudo read_ledger --type domain"
</p>
<p><strong>nbrempel</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 22:14:34 GMT):<br/>

Hi..I am trying to understand the code. I started with the simple_node.py file in examples. However, it makes a call to the addGenesisTxns and startKeySharing methods of the Node class which are not present in the code
</p>
<p><strong>pawan176</strong> (Sun, 26 Nov 2017 10:33:57 GMT):<br/>
Is this an issue?
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 10:05:15 GMT):<br/>
@pawan176 The code under `examples` is obsolete (our fault), have a look at the tests under `tests`
</p>
<p><strong>pawan176</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 16:58:13 GMT):<br/>

Hi all, is this the place to ask basic questions about the Alice demo?
</p>
<p><strong>wittrock</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 19:05:29 GMT):<br/>
If so, I've got a weird situation in which I'm supposedly connected to the sandbox network but not actually: ```ALICE@sandbox> accept request from "Faber College"
Request not yet verified.
Connection not yet synchronized.
Request acceptance aborted.
Cannot sync because not connected. Please connect first.

ALICE@sandbox> connect sandbox
Already connected to sandbox

Usage:
    connect <sandbox>```
</p>
<p><strong>wittrock</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 19:05:55 GMT):<br/>
So the `connect` command tells me I'm already connected but other commands tell me that I haven't.
</p>
<p><strong>nbrempel</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 19:06:47 GMT):<br/>
I think there is a command called `status`, try that
</p>
<p><strong>wittrock</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 19:09:53 GMT):<br/>
```ALICE@sandbox> status
Attempting connection to sandbox Indy network```
</p>
<p><strong>wittrock</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 19:10:08 GMT):<br/>
Not _quite_ sure what that means.
</p>
<p><strong>nbrempel</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 20:00:11 GMT):<br/>
I've seen that before, the cli isn't super clear. Basically that means that it attempted to connect, but did not connect successfully
</p>
<p><strong>nbrempel</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 20:00:37 GMT):<br/>
So the CLI cannot find the nodes on whatever IP you're pointing it at
</p>
<p><strong>wittrock</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 20:30:15 GMT):<br/>
aha, thank you! I'll double check open ports, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>nbrempel</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 20:40:17 GMT):<br/>
👍🏻
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 22:25:59 GMT):<br/>
@wittrock after you do "connect sandbox" you should you will see many lines displayed showing that the client is communicating with the nodes of your test network.  You should also see the following highlighted line:

*Connected to test.*

</p>
<p><strong>wittrock</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 22:35:45 GMT):<br/>
@mgbailey thanks! the problem was something related to my attempted docker setup, I got the connection working. Currently struggling with a similar CLI question around what I think is a failure to sync: ```ALICE@sandbox> sync faber
Expanding faber to "Faber College"

Synchronizing...

Try Next:
    show connection "Faber College"
    accept request from "Faber College"


ALICE@sandbox> accept request from Faber
Expanding Faber to "Faber College"
Request not yet verified.
Connection not yet synchronized.
Attempting to sync...

Synchronizing...
Remote endpoint (None) not found, can not connect to Faber College```
</p>
<p><strong>wittrock</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 22:36:01 GMT):<br/>
it seems likely to be another failed network setup on my part 
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 22:36:42 GMT):<br/>
Is the Faber agent started?
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 22:37:26 GMT):<br/>
What do you get when you do "show connection Faber"
</p>
<p><strong>wittrock</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 22:37:40 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>wittrock</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 22:38:56 GMT):<br/>
similar: I think the sync call is succeeding but the callback in the CLI isn't ever getting called. currently tracking down why
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 22:39:16 GMT):<br/>
It would appear that the faber agent attributes are not on the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>wittrock</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 22:39:51 GMT):<br/>
aha, interesting. Do you know enough about the getting started doc to know where that's supposed to happen in the flow?

Hi all, another question about the Alice demo: I've made progress on the initial setup of syncing to Faber (no more issues with verKeys not being found), but am currently dealing with a supposedly successful sync and then a failure to find an endpoint. My first sync looks something like this: ```ALICE@sandbox> accept request from "Faber College"
Request not yet verified.
Connection not yet synchronized.
Attempting to sync...
No key present in wallet for making request on Indy, so adding one
Key created in wallet Alice
DID for key is 7P5uXE7Dk5jE7RPzRb9cxS
Verification key is ~VDZdvdb74sEiPoHSPCFwJ
Current DID set to 7P5uXE7Dk5jE7RPzRb9cxS

Synchronizing...
    Connection Faber College synced
Remote endpoint (None) not found, can not connect to Faber College```

Subsequently the connection looks like this: ```ALICE@sandbox> show connection "Faber College"
Connection (not yet accepted)
    Name: Faber College
    DID: not yet assigned
    Trust anchor: Faber College (not yet written to Indy)
    Verification key: <empty>
    Signing key: <hidden>
    Remote: ULtgFQJe6bjiFbs7ke3NJD
    Remote Verification key: ~5kh3FB4H3NKq7tUDqeqHc1
    Remote endpoint: Not Available
    Request nonce: b1134a647eb818069c089e7694f63e6d
    Request status: not verified, remote verkey unknown
    Last synced: just now```

While I'm getting my nodes and agents set up, also see error messages like the following, but I'm not sure they're related to the problem I'm seeing:
```Error: client request invalid: InvalidClientRequest('dest should be added before adding attribute for it',)
Error: client request invalid: InvalidClientRequest('dest should be added before adding attribute for it',)
Error: client request invalid: InvalidClientRequest('dest should be added before adding attribute for it',)
Nym ULtgFQJe6bjiFbs7ke3NJD added
Nym CzkavE58zgX7rUMrzSinLr added
Nym H2aKRiDeq8aLZSydQMDbtf added```

Can anyone help me figure out why my client can't seem to find an endpoint?
</p>

You went through these steps? https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-environments/blob/master/vagrant/training/vb-multi-vm/TestIndyClusterSetup.md#setting-up-a-cli-client-and-configuring-the-agents-in-the-indy-cluster
</p>
<p><strong>nbrempel</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 21:44:53 GMT):<br/>
What happened when you ran the commands like this? `send NYM dest=ULtgFQJe6bjiFbs7ke3NJD role=TRUST_ANCHOR verkey=~5kh3FB4H3NKq7tUDqeqHc1`
</p>
<p><strong>wittrock</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 21:45:27 GMT):<br/>
those are the steps I'm using, yeah. I'd been scripting the first few commands (connect, new key with seed ..., send NYM..., ) and starting just at `prompt ALICE` but I decided that might have been hiding error messages
</p>
<p><strong>wittrock</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 21:45:44 GMT):<br/>
so I literally just tried to do it by hand, and I got: ```indy@sandbox> new key with seed 000000000000000000000000Steward1
Key created in wallet Default
DID for key is Th7MpTaRZVRYnPiabds81Y

Adding nym ULtgFQJe6bjiFbs7ke3NJD
Error: client request invalid: InvalidClientRequest('Th7MpTaRZVRYnPiabds81Y is neither Trustee nor owner of ULtgFQJe6bjiFbs7ke3NJD',)```
</p>
<p><strong>wittrock</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 21:46:29 GMT):<br/>
not totally sure how to fix that
</p>
<p><strong>wittrock</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 21:46:35 GMT):<br/>
in fact, not sure at all :)
</p>
<p><strong>nbrempel</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 21:47:09 GMT):<br/>
If you run the command `status` what do you get?
</p>
<p><strong>wittrock</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 21:47:24 GMT):<br/>
`Connected to sandbox Indy network`
</p>
<p><strong>nbrempel</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 21:48:41 GMT):<br/>
Hm, that's strange. When you started the Indy nodes, did you use the command `generate_indy_pool_transactions`? 
</p>
<p><strong>wittrock</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 21:48:52 GMT):<br/>
I did
</p>
<p><strong>wittrock</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 21:49:06 GMT):<br/>

The command is supposed to bootstrap the test network with dids with various levels of access. But it seems that the did for the seed `000000000000000000000000Steward1` doesn't have "steward" privileges like it should.

They track tickets here: https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/INDY/issues/INDY-562?filter=allopenissues but I'm not sure if the public has write access.

@sergey.minaev might know if it's a known bug.

<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Fri, 01 Dec 2017 00:13:16 GMT):<br/>
@wittrock , your validators should have a domain_transactions_genesis file that contains your trustees and stewards.  Steward1 should be in there, with role=2

Our team is working on a fancier UI to the dashboard.

@nbrempel and @swcurran thanks for sharing, very, very timely. I'm still putting together our RFP to use Indy with Fabric, and TBH what's missing for us is a simple GUI with "push button" controls to action things on the ledger such as provisioning entity's, writing schemas to the ledger and revoking claims.

The trouble is, once you go down this route, you need to be sure that a). the application user is "on the ledger" and has the correct Sovrin style role, and b). that users of the GUI application are authenticated in a way that is consistent with the underlying SSI principles of Indy. For the latter, I'm thinking a wallet app, whose derived pub keys are stored within it, and using a QR code to authenticate.

Still in the thinking stage though.

@theruss - login with SSI is crucial to us as well.  We are focused on the organizational use of SSI (vs. purely personal) and we hope (and are pushing) to see both authentication and authorization (aka roles/capabilities) with delegation of authority as a first class element.  We have our current project on the go (TheOrgBook), but that will lead quickly to authentication and authorization.

What is the difference between a schema and claim definition in the context of Indy? 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 18 Dec 2017 18:51:59 GMT):<br/>
A schema is just that - a definition of the fields in a schema - it has a name, version and creator.  A claim definition is a specific use of a schema by an identify, and (will eventually) provide a link to a revocation registry.  So a schema might be defined by a group of Banks, and each bank would create a claim def that defined their specific use of the schema.

<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 19:19:59 GMT):<br/>
@jljordan_bcgov , you can do this with access to all the nodes in the pool.  It is harder on the live network, where each steward has access to just one node.  How do you think stewards would feel about configuring their production nodes to push this data to a central location / aggregator that could display something like this?  Some of them are big, security-conscious organizations.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 19:35:02 GMT):<br/>
@mgbailey - agreed - that display and our current approach isn't going to scale to the live network. And we aren't really worried about our view of the live network - someone else's problem.  We are building these to make it easier to ramp up new devs and even business folks to help them understand what's going on.

We have been thinking about pushing that data into a graph database (centralized, as you say) for visualization and querying.  Again, primarily for ramping people up, but can be used for status.
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 19:35:33 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran +1 :)

<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 19:38:15 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran Right, but I want it for the live pool too!
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 19:41:26 GMT):<br/>
the Graph idea could be interesting for schema discovery we are thinking
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 19:41:53 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 19:47:39 GMT):<br/>
seems to make sense yes ... in fact we were thinking we would have a verifiable claim that is published by the gov that lists all their services DIDs

good afternoon, can you please explain how to use the Indy SDK? and how to implement it please, if I must first use for example this implementation of Docker https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/environment/docker/pool/README.md and then use the SDK or are they projects that work without depending on each other? since I want to implement a JAVA EE application to interact with the user.
Another question, How and in what type of database does the information keep?

Hi, for a proof of concept I would like to use the indy-node and the Plenum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) Protocol for a custom purpose. I would like to send a custom request from an agent to the indy-nodes. There I would like the nodes to process the request (basically execute a custom function) and then come to consent according to BFT. The result should be sent back to the agent.
Since the code will run locally I don’t mind adding code. My questions are: How is it possible to send a request to nodes so that the BFT Protocol is triggered? Where should I place a custom function that is executed by each node? Is there some information (demos, samples, testcases) that show how indy is executing the BFT Protocol? Thanks in advance!

Hi, happy new year

Quick question about why clients are being added to the ledger by the "generate_indy_pool_transactions" command .. from test_network_setup.py we have:  
```   for cd in client_defs:
            txn = Member.nym_txn(cd.nym, cd.name, verkey=cd.verkey, creator=trustee_def.nym)
            domainLedger.add(txn) ```
what is the purpose of registering new clients when starting the network?  Aren't clients created when the agent code is executed. for example from Faber.py code we create a new client like this:  
    ```if client is None:
        client = create_client(base_dir_path=base_dir_path, client_class=TestClient)```

<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 13:19:15 GMT):<br/>
@the_identity_guy 
In agents code we create an instance of Client that will connect to the pool and send requests. So, client here is a `code`.
In `test_network_setup.py` we create some pre-defined genesis transactions. It created genesis pool transactions (NODE txn defining a node in the pool), plus (optionally) a number of NYM transactions in domain ledger defining Trustees, Stewards, etc. These genesis NYM transactions are called 'clients' in the code. So, here client is a `genesis transaction on ledger`
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 13:20:05 GMT):<br/>
BTW please note that existing agents from indy-node repos (inclkuding Faber one) are going to be deprecated soon.
Please use https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk for any client communicaton
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 13:26:48 GMT):<br/>
@wolili 
As of now, it's not possible to add custom behaviour without writing custom code. But it will be possible soon using `plugins`.

We are working on a better documentation about BFT support in Plenum.
As of now you can have a look at https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/wiki and https://pakupaku.me/plaublin/rbft/5000a297.pdf
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 13:27:47 GMT):<br/>
@ronniemh 
Please have a look at https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk
It already has Java wrapper support.
It also contains docs about how to use SDK
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 13:28:06 GMT):<br/>
You can also ask questions in indy-sdk channel
</p>
<p><strong>ronniemh</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 14:32:07 GMT):<br/>
@ashcherbakov  thank you, another question: what do you mean by "...projects may collapse into this one, except for indy-sdk." in About Indy Node, why are they different?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 14:39:21 GMT):<br/>
indy-anoncreds will be deprecated soon.
So, it'more about indy-plenum and indy-node projects. In fact plenum contains general RBFT and pool support, while indy-node adds Indy-related transactions support. That's why they are different
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 14:39:56 GMT):<br/>
SDK is a separate one providing a read-to-use wrappers in different languages to be used in applications

thank you @ashcherbakov I understood the purpose of creating a trustee and 4 stewards (to manage 4 nodes) transactions but wasn't sure about the creation of clients in ''test_network_setup.py'' as part of the genesis transactions.. My understanding was that clients are used to hold keys and interact with ledger (optionally through agents).. are clients that are created during the genesis used by the Alice use case? can you elaborate a bit on what you mean by clients being a 'genesis transaction on ledger'? are the clients used by the stewards to interact with ledger? 
'''su - vagrant -c "generate_indy_pool_transactions --nodes 4 --clients 4 --ips '10.20.30.201,10.20.30.202,10.20.30.203,10.20.30.204'''

@smontsaroff The only officially supported platform for indy-node now is Ubuntu 16.04. We produce working and tested deb packages for it.
Do you want to develop indy-node (contribute to the code) using Mac OS, or you just want to run the Pool (without changing the code)? In the later case you can use Docker file (see https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/tree/master/environment/docker)

We are trying to build indy-node on a non-x86 platform.  I cloned github.com/hyperledger/indy-node.  There is no Makefile.  How is the build kicked off and where is native code compiled as part of this process?  @mgbailey @andkononykhin   Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Tue, 23 Jan 2018 17:18:58 GMT):<br/>
@smithbk , indy-node is currently python3 code, and does not require building.  Basically what is needed to make it work is:
   1) python3
   2) all the dependent libraries
   3) file placement in the correct directories, environment variables, etc.

In the future there will also be some custom RUST libraries that will need to be built, but that is not the case today.
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Tue, 23 Jan 2018 17:19:29 GMT):<br/>
python 3.5 or later, to be more exact

Hello, i have started to explore Indy, 

Step 1: I followed the Detailed Setup instructions listed on https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/stable/docs/setup-dev.md to run indy locally. I was successfully able to install the dependencies. 
Step 2: To start running indy, i was following https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/indy-running-locally.md and when i try to setup the environment (#Initial Setup), i am getting the following error 
"OSError: dlopen(libindy_crypto.dylib, 6): image not found" and not able to get this around. 

Need help in resolving this issue.
More Details : 'libindy_crypto.dylib' is generated when building indy-crypto (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-crypto#building-indy-crypto) and is in /indy-crypto/libindy-crypto/target/debug/deps folder

Let me know if i need to provide more details

no worries @mgbailey  - @akhihaki - let me follow up
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 07:55:49 GMT):<br/>
@akhihaki What is the purpose of the exploration?
If you need just to run the pool and write your applications against the pool (using https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk), then you can run the pool easily in Docker (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/tree/master/environment/docker/pool). No need to setup dev environment.
So, all client-related logic (send requests and transactions to the pool) as well as anoncreds protocol (verifiable claims) is within indy-sdk.

If you want to contribute to indy-node code (write code in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node repo dealing with RBFT, consensus, etc.) then you need to install dev environment as you started. Please let us know if you really need it, and we will try to help.

@ashcherbakov hi, I have two questions regarding your post above, that might seem trival, but I kind of got stuck.
1. does "run the pool" just mean to startup the docker, or do I have to run some code first?
2. Regarding the development of indy-node. In case I change/add code, how can I deploy/run the code on a local node?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 13:03:10 GMT):<br/>
@wolili 
1. no code is needed. you can just start the docker.
2. during development, you usually write and run intgeration tests (see test folders) which start a test pool (in one process). 
You can also run nodes locally as described in the guide you followed.
Once the PR is merged, and there is a deb package build, you can try it in Docker as well.

Hi people
</p>
<p><strong>hidde-jan</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 14:50:55 GMT):<br/>
Me and a few people are looking at running a test network, however, we'd like to generate our own steward keys and not use the default 00000...00Steward1 seeds used in all test environments
</p>
<p><strong>hidde-jan</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 14:51:29 GMT):<br/>
is there any guide or some examples of how to start an indy network from scratch?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 14:59:07 GMT):<br/>
@hidde-jan, you're in luck.  We've already done that.
https://github.com/topics/verifiable-organizations-network
You'll want to start with von-connector.
</p>

A running instance of the von-network complete with ledger browser; http://138.197.170.136/
A running instance of TheOrgBook connected to instances of the permitify services; https://devex-von-dev.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/roadmap
All provisional, so have at it.  Performs registration, claim def submissions, claim requests, proofs, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>hidde-jan</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:03:18 GMT):<br/>
@WadeBarnes thanks :)
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:04:10 GMT):<br/>
Things are in flux on the provisional sites, so there may be some interruptions.
</p>
<p><strong>hidde-jan</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:17:27 GMT):<br/>
@WadeBarnes I see you're generating your keys in https://github.com/bcgov/von-connector/blob/master/scripts/start_node.sh
</p>
<p><strong>hidde-jan</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:18:13 GMT):<br/>
but aren't these the default keys used in the testnetwork?
</p>
<p><strong>hidde-jan</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:22:36 GMT):<br/>
Is your provisional network set up using the same keys or did you manually bootstrap the nodes and create the genesis file?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:30:34 GMT):<br/>
Apologies I meant to point you at the von-network as your starting point.  The answer to your questions about genesis  file are there.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:32:57 GMT):<br/>
The von-network has an API endpoint where clients can get the genesis file.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:34:43 GMT):<br/>
This allows for a bit of dynamic configuration of agents connecting to the ledger; https://github.com/bcgov/TheOrgBook/blob/master/tob-api/tob_api/hyperledger_indy.py

<p><strong>hidde-jan</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:42:45 GMT):<br/>
it seems that you still use the generate_indy_pool_transactions under the hood, which still use hardcoded seeds as far as I can tell
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 16:17:53 GMT):<br/>
@hidde-jan You can either enhance  generate_indy_pool_transactions to support custom seeds, or just replace verkeys in genesis txns by the ones created by desired seeds.
BTW any contribution to enhance the scripts is appreciated.

@ashcherbakov ok, thanks. I’ve had a quick look. Enabling custom seeds seems to touch a lot of things all the way into Indy-plenum. I might have a further look :)

<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 17:02:16 GMT):<br/>
yes, unfortunately the code is quite tightly coupled in many places.
one of our goals is to re-factor it to avoid this.

Got another question about genesis transaction files
</p>
<p><strong>hidde-jan</strong> (Sun, 28 Jan 2018 16:22:29 GMT):<br/>
How is the txnId determined?
</p>
<p><strong>hidde-jan</strong> (Sun, 28 Jan 2018 16:22:59 GMT):<br/>
I noticed the files are generated by starting a node, adding a few NYM's and then writing the domain an pool genesis files
</p>
<p><strong>hidde-jan</strong> (Sun, 28 Jan 2018 16:24:42 GMT):<br/>
does that seem correct?

Hi I wonder can I just install all the stuff manually with python setup.py install ?
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Thu, 08 Feb 2018 08:13:06 GMT):<br/>
Because there are some compatible issues I have to resolve.
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Thu, 08 Feb 2018 08:13:28 GMT):<br/>
I tried, it seems some files are not properly processed
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 08 Feb 2018 08:40:37 GMT):<br/>
Hi @wangdong 
What is your use case? 
As of now, the only supported platform is Ubuntu (x86). And the only supported way to run Indy pool is to install a deb package.

</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 08 Feb 2018 08:41:06 GMT):<br/>
You can install via pypi or setup.py, but rather for dev purposes (development, running tests, etc.)
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Thu, 08 Feb 2018 08:41:35 GMT):<br/>
yes, I know that. I try to port this to s390 platform
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 08 Feb 2018 08:41:52 GMT):<br/>
What don't you create a deb package and test it?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 08 Feb 2018 08:42:03 GMT):<br/>
With a local installation ytou can check that all tests pass
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Thu, 08 Feb 2018 08:42:35 GMT):<br/>
sure
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Thu, 08 Feb 2018 08:42:56 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Thu, 08 Feb 2018 08:43:24 GMT):<br/>
I will try to have a build environment later on
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Thu, 08 Feb 2018 08:43:54 GMT):<br/>
for now, I just want see if there are any other compatible issues
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Thu, 08 Feb 2018 09:04:18 GMT):<br/>

@wangdong 
Did you run `create_dirs.sh`? Also we don't guarantee that it will work somewhere besides deb packages, since some special folders need to be created, and config files need to be prepared
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Thu, 08 Feb 2018 13:58:59 GMT):<br/>
yes, I ran it. And as you said, I fount the NETWORK_NAME is not created. I have to do that manually.
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 08 Feb 2018 15:19:13 GMT):<br/>
Please feel free to send PRs with your fixes regarding running the nodes locally (not from debs). We will aprreciate any contribution.
As I said, we don't officially support running the node locally (not from debs) now, but if you find all this issues and send a PR, that it would be great to support it again

Hi, we are running a node in docker and want to use supervisord rather than systemd so that we can run unprivileged and still want the control-tool to work.  Is the correct place to add this support by modifying these files to look for supervisorctl if systemctl doesn't exist? ```$ grep -lr systemctl scripts
scripts/upgrade_indy_node_ubuntu1604.sh
scripts/restart_sovrin_node_ubuntu1604.sh
scripts/upgrade_indy_node_ubuntu1604_test.sh
scripts/validator-info

Can a pool consisting of only 2 nodes be stable, or what's the minimum number of nodes?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 12:36:31 GMT):<br/>
@peacekeeper 
As the number of nodes in the pool is 3f+1, the minimum number of nodes for a functional pool should be 4 (f=1 in this case).
One can consider having a pool of, for example, 3 nodes, but f=0 in this case, so the system will not be able to survive if at least one malicious node appears.
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 12:46:15 GMT):<br/>
@smithbk 
1) I think it would be great and really appreciated if you raise a PR with supervisord support.
The only thing is that we should still keep systemctl support as our current builds are based on this.
2) You will also need to extend the build procedure which assumes using of systemd. Have a look at `build-scripts/ubuntu-1604/postinst_node`
You can grep by `systemd`.
Unfortunately, we don't have automated tests for this yet.

Hi all, I'm just looking at some inspiration for monitoring a indy node's performance. Are there any examples/ideas out there, like how many transactions in the past hour/current transaction number, etc?
</p>
<p><strong>hidde-jan</strong> (Mon, 05 Mar 2018 13:50:59 GMT):<br/>
Maybe some people actually integrated these things in their own logging/monitoring setup?
</p>
<p><strong>hidde-jan</strong> (Mon, 05 Mar 2018 14:20:28 GMT):<br/>
I notices the <node name>_info.json in /var/lib/indy, that seems handy, any other metrics that the node spits out?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Mon, 05 Mar 2018 14:58:48 GMT):<br/>
@hidde-jan 
You may be interested in `validator-info` tool based on `<node name>_info.json ` results.
The tool already provides some performance info (from the `monitor.py` module). And we are expecting to extend it with more info provided (see https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/design/validator_info.md)

Hi, I would like to write a custom function foo in indy-node, for example in node.py where I use other functions of indy and process them. I would like to write a testcase which uses this function in different Nodes.
Simplified the test should like:
`n1 = Node1()
n2 = Node2()
n3 = Node3()

n1.foo()
n2.foo()
n3.foo()`
This might sound trivial, but how do I correctly initialize nodes or how would a constructor look like? Is there some existing test case that is doing this, where I could take a look at?

I have 4 test nodes and want to stop them all at the same time and restart without losing what is on the ledger.  Can someone tell me how to do this?  Thanks

<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 11:02:57 GMT):<br/>
@smithbk 
The data on the ledger is persisted, so it will not be lost.
You can just restart the services on all nodes (systemctl restart indy-node), or stop and start them (systemctl stop indy-node; systemctl start indy-node).
Unfortunately, there is no automated way to do it at the exact same time on all nodes, but I think a script can be created for this.

Also we have plans to support `restart` command that can restart the whole pool at the specified time.

If you are talking about tests, then you can see an example of the pool restart in `test_primary_selection_after_primary_demotion_and_pool_restart` test (please note that TestNode instances are used in all tests, and all (test) nodes are started and run at the same process).
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 11:09:36 GMT):<br/>
@wolili 
What is your test case? Why do you need to implement a new function in `node.py`? Please note, that plugins are supported, so probably it's better to use plugins for your case. You can have a look at
`https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/docs/plugins.md` and `plenum/test/plugin/demo_plugin`

As for existing tests, usually an instance of `TestNode` is used there. All nodes in the pool are started and run at the same process in integration tests (see plenum/tests).
You can have a look at `txnPoolNodeSet` fixture (and `create_new_test_node` helper method) where a pool of TestNodes is created, and just use this fixture (or a similar one) in your tests.

Hi @ashcherbakov, I was using the VirtualBox and Vagrant guide

<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 16:49:50 GMT):<br/>
@carter.willetts Hi, I'm about to start through the VB and vagrant guide this morning. I just successfully went through the getting started guide using the local test network solution. If you already have virtual box installed, I would recommend that you set up a fresh Ubuntu 16.04 instance with virtual box, then get indy running locally in that instance. It went very smoothly for me when I did that.  (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/indy-running-locally.md) 
</p>
<p><strong>carter.willetts</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 16:55:15 GMT):<br/>

I'm looking at how to set up and run a simulation of indy cluster and agents documented here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/cluster-simulation.md. 

when I try to install indy-client using pip, via the command `pip install -U --no-cache-dir indy-client` I'm told that there is no matching distribution found for indy-client. I have the full dev environment set up on Ubuntu, does anyone know if I'm doing this wrong, or is the page deprecated?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:35:50 GMT):<br/>
@mboyd @carter.willetts 
It looks like `cluster-simulation.md` is an outdated document. We don't support indy-client now.
The getting started from indy-node repo is also going to be deprecated (since it's based on the old unsupported client).
The new Getting started was created based on libindy: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/getting-started/getting-started.md
</p>
<p><strong>carter.willetts</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 16:01:22 GMT):<br/>
@ashcherbakov I am having some problems attaching the agents to the cluster on the local tutorial ( https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/indy-running-locally.md ) is this file also deprecated?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 16:02:20 GMT):<br/>
@carter.willetts It may be not deprecated, but this is no the intended way to have a local pool.
Please use either Docker or Vagrant.

<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Mon, 26 Mar 2018 03:18:06 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Mon, 26 Mar 2018 12:59:58 GMT):<br/>
@wangdong 
We are planning to migrate to rocksdb.
It will be done only after notification, so don't worry.
As of now leveld is still going to be used (at least for the next stable release).
Rocksdb will be used just for one storage needed for revocation support.

We are planning to migrate to rocksdb together with other breaking (non-backward compatible) changes, such as changes of requests and transactions format.

Of whom is the "signature" entry (steward, agend, primary, replica?)? Why is the "signatures" entry "null"? Shouldn't a user receiving the reply know who validated the request?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 13:04:49 GMT):<br/>
@wolili The current implementation has two fields `signatures` (if we use multi-signature approach) and `signature` if there is just one signature expected. 
This is quite ugly and will be re-factored soon.
Please have a look at the proposal in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/87e363462bb9c93861e413fe02f935e851a1c10a/docs/requests.md#signed-message-structure
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 13:05:34 GMT):<br/>
So, in the current implementation we may have either `signatures` or `signature`, but not both. In the proposal there will be just one signature field
</p>
<p><strong>wolili</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 08:37:43 GMT):<br/>
@ashcherbakov thank you for your reply. The proposal looks interesting. Just for clarification: The "signature" is created by the "Submitter" (client) or by the "Processer" (node) of the request?

<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 08:44:34 GMT):<br/>
@wolili By the Submitter (Client). BTW A Node may also play the role of a client and be a Submitter (see NODE_UPGRADE txn)
There are also BLS multi-signatures set by nodes. They are present in Replies to Requests.
</p>
<p><strong>wolili</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 08:56:02 GMT):<br/>
@ashcherbakov Ok, how can you see/enable multi-signatures in replies, because the code from above doesn't have them...
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 09:07:40 GMT):<br/>
What do you mean by multi-signatures in Replies? BLS multi-signature? As of now this is just one signature (one value), but this is multi-signature because this is multiplication of signatures from all nodes.

Assume I would like to write on the ledger, I will make a write request to some node. When I receive a reply I would like to know which node(s) have processed my request and created the reply. 
My reply: `{'result': {'identifier': 'MSjKTWkPLtYoPEaTF1TUDb', 'signatures': None, 'type': '99992', 'signature': '4qhfFzyBtWoQjQ3PkF3QLopvPLLRsVgaNTMqSws5uzFLD2xj7XhvtagCY5YK42yWSCJXJMbWFeCwSftzXxemm1sp', 'seqNo': 2, 'rootHash': '85ak6icH4YJfpLBJy8KVKofD2gvwfiK1DbvGyBnCLde4', 'txnTime': 1522309945, 'reqId': 16175, 'data': {'amount': 20, 'id': 'abc'}, 'auditPath': ['BvgckVXbuuPzJDmrSnBAFFWPSDD4NHP9EerVfgY5Xkek']}, 'op': 'REPLY'}`
I took a look at this json: you told me that the signature in there is from me (the submitter of the request), so where is the signature from the node(s)?

Hi, I am following the dev tutorial to setup indy on my local system and was on step 2 that says this

*set Network name in config file*
the location of the config depends on how a Node was installed. It's usually inside /etc/indy for Ubuntu.
the following needs to be added: NETWORK_NAME={network_name} where {network_name} matches the one in genesis transaction files above

I am no sure how to give this network name because i cannot initialize a node without a network name. Am i missing something?

@the_identity_guy  - the minimum number of nodes is 4. The plenum protocol requires that many nodes to operate.  The maximum number of nodes can go up significantly (not sure how high), but will have a configured maximum. As I understand it, the HL-Indy approach is to have configure Sovrin to have a maximum number of writer nodes, have the rest of the Stewards operate as observer nodes and have observer nodes become writer nodes to maintain a sufficient number of nodes. Any of the nodes can be used for reading.
</p>
<p><strong>the_identity_guy</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 20:49:54 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran thank you!, after reading the Plenum and RBFT consensus  docs I realized the consensus supports 3f+1 = n  nodes with f faulty nodes .. i.e. if n is anything less than 4, no faulty nodes can be supported. to support 1 faulty node we need 3(1) + 1 = 4 nodes

Do you have any clue? Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 16:32:46 GMT):<br/>
@AnhDung - that will be related to a recent upgrade of the base58 library.  You can search back in RocketChat for references from real developers (I just pretend :-) ).  I'll see if I can find a related commit that might help from our project.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 16:40:49 GMT):<br/>
I think you need to lock down base58 as follows - base58==0.2.5 - until the libindy is update to reflect the change in base58.  @WadeBarnes  - can you confirm/help?

Many of you have asked for an explanation of how the revocation feature works -- something that's not math-heavy, and that doesn't refer to specific chunks of code, but rather explains the basic concepts. Here is something that may help: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/cred-revocation.md

@esplinr Do you have any logging tickets in the current indy-node sprint that I could volunteer for?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 10 May 2018 20:18:05 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman The issue in the current sprint is probably under control:
 We are adding a specific message requested by Evernym Customer Success to flag when transactions are not added: INDY-1274. I think this one is under control.
But there are a number of issues not in the current sprint that would be useful for you to provide some direction on how best to proceed:
* We need to create an issue with a plan for addressing the underlying performance concern found in Olga's benchmarking
* INDY-1311: Review log messages to ensure that they are emitted at the correct log level. Currently too much is at INFO level.
* INDY-1300 is a simple task requested by Evernym customer success.

cannot import name 'Replica'
</p>
<p><strong>ryanwest6</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 19:12:01 GMT):<br/>
I'd post this in an indy-plenum channel but looks like this is the closest I've got. I'm trying to run the indy-plenum unit tests using PyCharm and I get 3 errors like this: "ImportError: cannot import name 'Replica'", one of these in the file indy-plenum/plenum/server/primary_selector.py (line is "from plenum.server.replica import Replica"). But the python file replica.py is definitely there, as is its class, Replica. There are no other import issues (the previous line, 'from plenum.server.primary_decider import PrimaryDecider', works just fine) and I'm on master. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 07:44:51 GMT):<br/>
@ryanwest6 Did you follow https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/setup-dev.md to start working with plenum from PyCharm?
</p>
<p><strong>wolili</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 08:28:53 GMT):<br/>
Hi everyone, I created a plugin in plenum. I created testcases which do read and write requests. Everything works with little code using the TestNodes and pytests - which is pretty cool, respect to you guys. For a Proof of Concept I would like to use my plugin not only with the pytests, but also with a local pool (docker-setup) that I could connect to my Indy-SDK. I have seen in indy-sdk/ci/indy-pool.dockerfile that indy-plenum is installed using a deb package. So my current approach would be to create a deb package from my local plenum and manually install it in the docker instead of the original deb package. Is this possible, are there better options? Any recommendations, thoughts, experiences, ideas are highly appreciated! Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 12:37:38 GMT):<br/>
@wolili I think the idea of a plugin is that you can extend plenum without changing existing builds, so probably you can just copy your plugin into appropriate folders (or create a deb package for the plugin or some installation script that can make the copy)
</p>
<p><strong>ryanwest6</strong> (Sun, 20 May 2018 18:10:29 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-node?msg=2nzhrJCLpsCW4tkii) @ashcherbakov I did not. I am attempting to run the plenum on its own (not using anything from the indy-node repo) and get all of its tests passing before cloning indy-node and trying to run it on top of indy-plenum. I'm using the installation and dependencies found on https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/README.md.
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 07:19:05 GMT):<br/>
@ryanwest6 The instruction I mentioned is not for indy-node, but from plenum also (actually we probably need to copy it to plenum as well). Some dependencies need to be installed (RocksDB, libsodium, etc.) to be able to run the tests locally. The provided link contains the information.

@AxelNennker 
The latest version of indy-node (in master) uses RocksDB instead of levelDB, so just an upgrade doesn't work. 
The intended way to upgrade Indy-Node is to send POOL_UPGRADE command which can take care of all necessary migrations (such as migration from leveldb to rocksdb).
As a workaround you can try to run a migration script manually (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/data/migrations/deb/1_3_396_to_1_3_397.py)

Actually if this is just a test pool and you don't have any valuable data in the ledger, then it's easier just to re-create the pool on the latest version.

This is a NODE txn (the txn telling what Nodes the pool consists of).
A steward's txn is a NYM txn with a Steward role telling DID/key for a Steward.
genesis txn file consists of a NODE txns defining initial set of the nodes in the pool (to be used by clients and new nodes for initial connection). So, genesis txn file is initial subset of the pool ledger transactions.
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 07:32:34 GMT):<br/>
> a separate unrelated question: is the `validator verkey, the HEX verification key for your server` located somewhere on the steward node's disk? or is it *only* accessible from STDOUT when you run the `init_indy_node` script?
The verkey is stored on the disk (together with a signing key) and (as this is a public part) also stored in NODE txn on the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 07:34:27 GMT):<br/>
> i have seen the terms `public key` and `verification key` used interchangeably
No, ZeroMQ (curveCP implementation which is our secure node-to-node transport) requires both verkey-signingKey and public-private key pairs. Actually one can be obtained from the other by some transformation, that's why only the verkey is stored on the ledger.

@AxelNennker What is the pool you are working with? If this is a production-like pool, then all updates *must* be done via POOL_UPGRADE txn, not manually.

Hi, how do I prevent indy-node from binding to 0.0.0.0? Only one interface is the correct one and I don't want the service to be available on the e.g. admin interface of the host. Node_ip is not the right option.

<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 08:12:47 GMT):<br/>
@AxelNennker We've just fixed it this Sprint. The latest version of master allows to specify IP. 
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/start-nodes.md#generating-keys So, you can replace 0.0.0.0 with the the value you want.

I would remove the optional seed from the examples in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/start-nodes.md#generating-keys because people will use the example seed and later move the test network to production. 'init_indy_node Alpha 0.0.0.0 9701 0.0.0.0 9702 [--seed 111111111111111111111111111Alpha]'

<p><strong>sergey-shilov</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 08:32:36 GMT):<br/>
hi @AxelNennker, you can specify IPs for node-to-node and client-to-node communication in /etc/indy/indy.env file. So append something like this:
NODE_IP=127.0.0.10
CLIENT_IP=10.0.0.5
</p>

Just go to the node machine, and run `read_ledger --type=domain` (try -h for more options), or `validator_info` (try -h for more options). Please run the scripts from the `indy` user.
A list of helper scripts: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/helper-scripts.md

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-node?msg=kpQp9pAXwfZoFnBSY) @sergey-shilov I think this will stop my node from working because the node _needs_ the public IP address to be reachable but that public IP address is not assigned to any LAN interface because the firewall (DDOS protection etc) has the public IP address. The node has three private addresses. Only one of them gets the traffic that is directed to the node's public IP. How do I tell indy-node that about the public IP address and at the same time bind to only one of the LAN interfaces - identified by its private IP address). I tried once to start the node with the private address which resulted in it not being reachable by the other nodes. I can try that again but ...
</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 08:45:29 GMT):<br/>
More specific: The node should use its public IP address if that is part of any message send out to other parties but only bind its listening sockets to one private IP address.
</p>
<p><strong>sergey-shilov</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 08:49:12 GMT):<br/>
indy-node gets IPs for binding from indy.env file, so you can specify your private address for listening. Other nodes get IP for connection from pool ledger, where should be specified node's public IP

@sergey-shilov No, you are probably assuming I am running indy-node from git but I am using version indy-node 1.3.428 on this node. Sorry for the misunderstanding. It is still unclear to me which IP address to use when and where. I think that an indy.env might need to look like for my infrastructure:
NODE_NAME=something
NODE_PORT=9700
NODE_CLIENT_PORT=9701
NODE_IP=public-IP
CLIENT_IP=another-or-the-same-public-ip
NODE_BIND_IP=private-ip

@ashcherbakov So I am using the default docker-compose file given in the SDK, and run `docker exec indy_pool read_ledger --type pool` on my terminal, and it shows the genesis transaction (with the node info)... However, I run the write_did_and_query_verkey tutorial till the addition of trust anchor. Now the trust anchor is getting verified by the script, but the `read_ledger` command is still showing the genesis transactions only... Where am I going wrong?

<p><strong>sergey-shilov</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 09:36:43 GMT):<br/>
@AxelNennker of course for version indy-node 1.3.428 these parameters are ignored and it still binds to 0.0.0.0

How do the node or client know their public IP address?
</p>
<p><strong>sergey-shilov</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 09:44:19 GMT):<br/>
@AxelNennker regarding NODE_IP and NODE_BIND_IP... lets look at indy-node as at a simple server that listens for incoming connections, and it just need one IP address to listen on. why does it need any knowledge about proxy/NAT/DDoS-protector public IP if that proxy forwards packets from it's public IP to node's local IP?
</p>
<p><strong>sergey-shilov</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 09:45:21 GMT):<br/>
public IP is needed just for other nodes to be able to connect

</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 09:49:12 GMT):<br/>
It is then a problem if the public IP address is used IN a message between nodes. There only the public IP address MUST be used because the others MUST not know about my private network layout. If the IP address of the node is never taken from NODE_IP or CLIENT_IP but published somewhere else then everything works. Coming back to the first answer regarding key generation, should 0.0.0.0 replaced by the public IP address or the private NIC adddress?

</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 10:13:27 GMT):<br/>
No. 

other nodes - Internet - FW with public addresses for node and client - node with several private addresses
</p>
<p><strong>sergey-shilov</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 10:21:20 GMT):<br/>
so, to make it worked, your FW should do port forwarding, i.e. forward packets sent to GLOBAL_IP:NODE_PORT to LOCAL_IP:NODE_PORT, right?
</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 10:28:31 GMT):<br/>
Yes, the FW does exactly this. This is all working and it will continue to work after indy-node stops binding to 0.0.0.0. My concern is that the node might use the bind address in a message to others who are then confused or reject the message because the IP address is different to the public IP. If inside of messages the public IP is used then everything is fine. But how does the node know its public IP address if it is not in NODE_IP nor CLIENT_IP?
</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 10:29:26 GMT):<br/>
If the IP address is never inside a message then there is no problem at all.
</p>
<p><strong>sergey-shilov</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 10:38:03 GMT):<br/>
as I remember, we don't add IP addresses inside of our business-logic messages, IPs are only presented in TCP/IP headers
</p>
<p><strong>sergey-shilov</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 10:38:41 GMT):<br/>
and your FW does NAT, so your setup should work
</p>
<p><strong>sergey-shilov</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 10:42:52 GMT):<br/>
bind indy-node to local IPs by setting NODE_IP and CLIENT_IP, setup correct port forwarding on your FW and all should work
</p>
<p><strong>sergey-shilov</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 14:41:38 GMT):<br/>
@AxelNennker sorry, use NODE_CLIENT_IP instead of CLIENT_IP in indy.env file
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 22:57:04 GMT):<br/>
@AxelNennker , let me chime in here, and perhaps summarize some of the conversation. The goal is to have 2 externally-reachable NICs. This is to allow isolation between client and node traffic, so that a DOS attack on the client port will not interfere with traffic between validator nodes.  We also expect that the node port will be firewalled so that connections are only accepted from other validators, while the client port is open to any IP address.
Unfortunately there is currently a bug so that the client port binding is to 0.0.0.0 instead of to its specific IP address. This defect will be fixed in an upcoming release, in about a month.
The client and node ports and IP addresses are published on the ledger, which information will be used by the other validators and client to connect to your validator. 
In the current release, I do not see where the client and node IP addresses are configured in configuration files, but in the release where the client port is properly bound to a particular IP address, I assume that they will be configured, perhaps in /etc/indy/indy.env. @sergey-shilov , can you confirm this?

</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 08:12:20 GMT):<br/>
The question is how 'The client and node ports and IP addresses are published on the ledger' is done. NODE_IP and NODE_CLIENT_IP are private addresses (in my case), so the node does not know its public address. In the Steward Preparation Guide is this done by the Sovrin admin after the steward had send the node's info per email to Sovrin?
</p>
<p><strong>sergey-shilov</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 08:27:56 GMT):<br/>
@mgbailey exactly
</p>
<p><strong>sergey-shilov</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 09:16:14 GMT):<br/>
@AxelNennker "NODE_IP and NODE_CLIENT_IP are private addresses (in my case)" - this absolutely right setup.
Regarding the question how 'The client and node ports and IP addresses are published on the ledger' is done: each new node is added to the pool by special transaction called "node transaction". Each pool node and pool client gets IP/port to connect from this transaction. So that this transaction contains PUBLIC node and client IPs to be able to connect. These IPs may differ from NODE_IP and NODE_CLIENT_IP (your case with separated FW with port forwarding), but may be the same. If FW's public IP is changed then corresponding node transaction should be sent to propagate updated node info
</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 10:07:40 GMT):<br/>
Would you advice to add NODE_IP and NODE_CLIENT_IP to indy.env now so that it is there when the next package update is done?
</p>
<p><strong>sergey-shilov</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 10:19:07 GMT):<br/>
I don't think that it is needed now... this will be done by migration script during upgrade of indy-node package. But note that this migration script gets value for NODE_IP from pool ledger, i.e. your PUBLIC IP, and sets 0.0.0.0 for NODE_CLIENT_IP as the script does not know which iface do you prefer for binding. So you can change these two parameters after upgrade is finished. We plan to provide a doc for stewards about that upgrade and binding configuration.
</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 10:27:29 GMT):<br/>
If I add the values now would the migration script respect them? Removing the public IP after the upgrade would result in a second (short) downtime, right?
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>sergey-shilov</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 10:34:27 GMT):<br/>
For now the migration script does not respect them. I can implement appending of these parameters just in case of their absence to avoid the second downtime, but I need to check it with our team as these changes take a time to be merged in master due to our CI and CD pipelines

Hi all,
I'm trying to run a demo from IBM-Blockchain-Identity/indy-ssivc-tutorial on Ubuntu 16.04, 
and webserver in VON network is crashing with indy.error.IndyError: ErrorCode.PoolLedgerTimeout
I assume that this error means that Indy ledger is not working. But not sure why or how to fix it
I appreciate any ideas and suggestions
Thanks

What version of node and client (SDK) do you use? As was announced on meetings and mailing lists, there are some breaking changes in master node (comparing to previous stable). So, please make sure that you either use stable or latest master for *both* indy-node and indy-sdk.

We have a tool `validator_info` which can be run on a node to a lot of statistics (including connections to other nodes)

BTW the tool was improved and extended in the latest master, so it should give more info. 
Also there is a command (available from the new indy-sdk-based CLI) `ledger get-validator-info` which can be run from a Steward to get info from all the nodes in the pool

I'm running indy network from https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain-Identity/indy-ssivc-tutorial
the version of Indy that composes a network of nodes is Indy 1.2.297
I want to run a demo to showcase Indy in our company, so can't really switch to a different Indy version simply because I don't have enough expertise with Indy to do so.
when I run `validator-info` I get back```

also from the log of a node I get:

I am not sure why is it a different port number that node is listening to (e.g. 9418 vs 970x)

Any ideas?

I'm not aware of the content of  https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain-Identity/indy-ssivc-tutorial
You can try an official Docker from https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/tree/master/environment/docker/pool

In general it should be the same port. You can compare the content of the pool ledger (run `read_ledger`, which contains public data), and `indy.env` file (in /etc/indy/indy.env)

@sativ It could be that the IP address for DOCKERHOST isn't being set when you run the manage script.  If you are running on Windows, this is very likely the problem.  Please open an issue with specific details in the git repo (https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain-Identity/indy-ssivc-tutorial/issues) and we will take a  look.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 19:38:46 GMT):<br/>
FYI - this is a good multiplatform way to get the DOCKERHOST set:

```
export DOCKERHOST=${APPLICATION_URL-$(docker run --rm --net=host codenvy/che-ip)}
```

It uses a docker image from Codenvy.  Run that before you start up the various components.  @brycecurtis - you or we :-) could add that to the manage script to increase the flexibility.  We've been using it for awhile in our scripts.
</p>
<p><strong>brycecurtis</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 21:08:53 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran Nice.  Will take a look at it.

Does the current implementation of Indy-Node support the pending DID Document standard as it currently stands?  In particular does Indy allow a DID to have multiple public keys/authentication methods and multiple endpoints?   I'm not talking about storing the information on the ledger as a DID Doc, but whether multiple keys and endpoints are supported.

Hi,
I have setup a couple nodes in docker using the commands in the indy-sdk read me. And a docker for indy-cli
What I am unsure of is how indy-cli knows of the nodes in the other docker image.
There is a create pool option in cli, but I can't see how this is setup to connect to my nodes, so at the moment nothing can be ledgered until the pool is setup
Any suggestions for a pool create gen file and how it is setup? The docker one I found in github does not work
thanks

tks, that lead me to more info:
  Step 1. Create the pool ledger from genesis txn file
          A genesis txn file contains the information about the NODE and
          CLIENT machines. With this information after dumped to JSON format
          and a name, a pool ledger is created.
  Step 2. Open pool ledger to get the pool handle via pool name.
          The returned pool handle is used in methods that require pool
          connection
  Step 3. Create the new Wallet.
  Step 4. Get wallet handle to use in methods that require wallet access.
But I believe that I have a ledger pool in a running docker connection.
Question is how do i direct indy-cli to it

<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 03:17:53 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog I have done the demo before with success, what I want to achieve is 
1. run the docker nodes in a container -  it appears that this is done
2. Setup a wall and a did - and connect to one of the pools to ledger a ddo
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 03:20:47 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog presently I am attempting to build indysdk cli but now this:
warning: spurious network error (2 tries remaining): [28] Timeout was reached (Operation timed out after 30002 milliseconds with 0 out of 0 bytes received)
warning: spurious network error (1 tries remaining): [6] Couldn't resolve host name (Couldn't resolve host 'static.crates.io')
error: unable to get packages from source

Caused by:
  [6] Couldn't resolve host name (Couldn't resolve host 'static.crates.io')
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 03:24:01 GMT):<br/>
let me try running it and seeming what I get. From googling that error it looks like an issue with rust and their dns resolution
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 03:24:54 GMT):<br/>
@PhillipGibb are you on `commit 129b813d6b247a14b869759bdfe56ad15b2fabbc`
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 03:26:39 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 03:27:22 GMT):<br/>
gotcha, and are you trying to get the cluster pool running in docker or the actual sdk?
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 03:30:00 GMT):<br/>
the actual sdk
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 03:37:41 GMT):<br/>
It looks like this has an sdk dockerfile setup already. Did you use this guide last time by chance? https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/getting-started/run-getting-started.md
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 03:59:33 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog going to do that again with docker compose, but I have a docker running with the pools setup, problem is I want to use the indysdk - cli and I am not able to connect to a pool
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 04:00:41 GMT):<br/>
yeah I'm seeing similar issues currently. If you run `docker-compose down` then `docker-compose up --build` that should get you an image setup
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 04:08:55 GMT):<br/>
then you should (this is where I'm stuck at currently) be able to run tests within a terminal by editing files within your local file system and then testing them within the docker container by running `docker run -it --name --rm indy-sdk -v <location of your indy-sdk repo on your local filesystem>/indy-sdk:/home/indy-dev getting-started bash`
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 04:11:00 GMT):<br/>
from here, the indy-sdk container should be setup and we'll have a common system to work with
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 04:11:42 GMT):<br/>
I'm thinking what is causing this problem is either the genesis txns or the network setup in the dockerfile.yaml so I'm trying to change stuff in that right now
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 04:12:46 GMT):<br/>
coool, tks. I am going to try that
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 04:20:11 GMT):<br/>
Ok, I've gotten it to work with a few tweaks.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 04:20:44 GMT):<br/>
do you want to jump on a zoom call? I can probably explain this much faster on there.
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 04:28:02 GMT):<br/>
can't do a voice call with everyone sleeping :O
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 04:28:16 GMT):<br/>
how did you get past: error: no matching version `^1.0.16` found for package `sodiumoxide`
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 04:33:10 GMT):<br/>
no worries, I didn't encounter that error, but I've seen it before. give me a second and I'll see if I can remember what causes that
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 04:35:41 GMT):<br/>
is this an issue when you're trying to build the node or the sdk image?
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 04:40:10 GMT):<br/>
when I try to build the docker image in ci/ 
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 04:41:27 GMT):<br/>
@PhillipGibb what does lines 27 - 31 say on there? I assume they're the same because we're on the same commit but I want to double check
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 04:42:55 GMT):<br/>
ARG indy_plenum_ver=1.2.389
ARG indy_anoncreds_ver=1.0.32
ARG indy_node_ver=1.3.446
ARG python3_indy_crypto_ver=0.4.1
ARG indy_crypto_ver=0.4.0

</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 04:45:10 GMT):<br/>
ok, we're matching on that
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 04:47:02 GMT):<br/>
I did manage to get an image to run with the pools. Yesterday, I believe that it used sodiumoxide 1.0.14
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 04:48:41 GMT):<br/>
yeah that's what I was thinking, but I'm not finding any sodiumoxide dependecies in the files
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 04:49:00 GMT):<br/>
I know there is one, I just can't remember which repo it's for
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 04:53:02 GMT):<br/>
it looks like the only place it's used is by indy-sdk for a cargo crate
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 04:55:38 GMT):<br/>
I was already planning to build exactly what you're looking for within my next sprint (2 weeks). Would you be able to wait until that's finished and I'll send you the dockerfiles and documentation to test it?
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 04:57:37 GMT):<br/>
thanks for the help, I am going to have to continue later because I have to go now
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 04:59:11 GMT):<br/>
same, I'll ping you once I get this new stuff built
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 12:08:38 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog I have managed to get the getting* started *
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 12:10:13 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog I have managed to get the getting started docker image going with docker composer up but the url to 8888 does not work so I don't even know if I can connect to the pool with the cli
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 12:11:12 GMT):<br/>
even if it is working I am struggling to find documentation on the genesis file needed to make a connection to the pool
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 12:11:12 GMT):<br/>
even if it is working I am struggling to find documentation on the genesis file needed to make a connection to the pool
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 12:31:44 GMT):<br/>
actually if I use 127.0.0.1:800 I see stuff - what I can do with it is debatable, but there is a genesis file there
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 12:33:08 GMT):<br/>
I build libindy for my platform (macos) successfully
but I can't build cli so the to liblndy is
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 12:33:15 GMT):<br/>
is pointless
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 12:33:51 GMT):<br/>
back to an unbuntu docker image to connect to the pool which does not work, I wonder what works
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 13:14:21 GMT):<br/>
actually creating a pool with the genesis file and connecting results in "Indy SDK error occurred CommonInvalidState"
sigh
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 19:57:14 GMT):<br/>
Yeah that's the exact same error I'm getting. I'm going to talk with Slava to see what that means. Sorry about the frustration with running the setup. This is something I'm particularly interested in fixing to create a more consistent on boarding experience and developer experience.
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 20:19:49 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog what I can get right is running indy cli via docker, register a did on the test net them connect to the ledger and query a few things
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 20:26:47 GMT):<br/>
unfortunately I can't query an attrib - I think that there is a bug there; the help says I can use a few option none of which work
and error says I can't use attrib but the example shows it
I thought I could query my email
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 20:34:48 GMT):<br/>
What's the error you're receiving when trying to query attrib?
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 20:48:35 GMT):<br/>
it says attrib is not a valid argument
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 20:53:28 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog I am going to code a few node.js calls using a wrapper, do you know of a guide that displays a recommended guide to kickstart with? 
e.g. 
1. Create wallet if it does not exist (open wallet)
2. Create DID or use one
3. open connection to pool
4. connect to ledger
5. publish a piece of public information that is signed
6. query and verify that info off the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 10 Jun 2018 00:44:29 GMT):<br/>
@PhillipGibb  - a couple of things.  First, the indy-agent - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent- repo has a starter indy reference agent in node.  There is a pending PR from BYU, so their repo is a little ahead - https://github.com/byu-oit/indy-agent

Next - your step 5 is not how Indy works. Data does not get published on the ledger.  The ledger is for keys/endpoints (DIDs, DID Docs), schema, Credential Definitions and related Revocation data.   
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 10 Jun 2018 00:52:20 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog - we definitely want to figure out why this was so hard.  We've been using docker for 10 months for Indy, and can spin up networks and agents in seconds.  
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sun, 10 Jun 2018 01:03:51 GMT):<br/>
Are you guys using make files? I think that's the main problem is that commands are too specific as well as there's some changes happening for 1.5 that are getting node and SDK out of sync occasionally because they were breaking changes.
</p>
<p><strong>PhillipGibb</strong> (Sun, 10 Jun 2018 06:48:33 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran yes, thanks, I understand that - about the data.  Huge thanks for pointing me to the reference agent - this is the kind of thing I want to setup

Hi! I'm new to indy-node and I'm trying to implement a pretty simple use case to just create a new connection request. I've been looking for a while now and I'm not sure how to do that, changing/adding files in the sample folder doesn't seem to be working. Please help! 
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 11 Jun 2018 17:38:59 GMT):<br/>
@slr What do you mean by a connection request? You want to establish a DID relationship?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 11 Jun 2018 17:40:34 GMT):<br/>
Oh @slr, I see now that you cross posted in a bunch of channels. That makes it hard to know where to assist you in a collaborative way. I think #indy is probably the best place.
</p>
<p><strong>slr</strong> (Mon, 11 Jun 2018 17:41:02 GMT):<br/>
oops sorry about that! I wasn't sure which one to put it in :/

i ultimately am trying to create a new agent but for starters I was just trying to establish a new DID relationship and see if I understood how that works

any help would be appreciated!
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 11 Jun 2018 17:44:21 GMT):<br/>
If it isn't clear where to post, it is best in #indy. That's the catch-all channel.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 11 Jun 2018 17:45:15 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran recently put together a document to guide people who want to implement agents. You might find it helpful.

@RyanWest im not sure anyone has ventured into this territory yet. If you figure it out can you document how to setup Indy-node for Fedora?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Fri, 15 Jun 2018 07:01:39 GMT):<br/>
As was announced, the next stable release 1.4 of Indy-Node (which will be issued in a week or so), contains some breaking changes related to transaction format. The changes are done for a better versioning support (that is to support compatibility in future) and more readable format of data (separating payload data, metadata and signature). 
There will a new stable release of LibIndy (1.5) which should be used to work with IndyNode 1.4.

*General*

    - By default LibIndy 1.5 will be compatible with IndyNode 1.3, and not 1.4
    - LibIndy 1.5 can become compatible with IndyNode 1.4 if `indy_set_protocol_version(2)` is called during app initialization.


*Guideline for applications*

   - An application can freely update to LibIndy 1.5 and still use stable Node 1.3
   - If an app wants to work with the latest master or Stable Node 1.4, then it needs to
        - support breaking changes (there are not so many, mostly a new reply for write txns as txn format is changed)
          There is a migration guide for Indy-Node 1.3 to 1.4: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/1.3_to_1.4_migration_guide.md
        - call `indy_set_protocol_version(2)` during app initialization

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-node?msg=2SuGLFSSfF4Zkr25r) I've solved this problem; all you need to do is open up util/status.cc:19 and change the line `std::strncpy(result, state, cch - 1)` to  `std::strncpy(result, state, cch)` . This allows rocksdb to build succefully and then you can do `pip install python-rocksdb`. This will be fixed on the rocksdb side, but I'll post the solution here in case anyone else runs into it until then.
</p>
<p><strong>RyanWest</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 15:31:22 GMT):<br/>
As another issue, I believe I've found a circular dependency when trying to run the indy-plenum unit tests using Pycharm. When trying to import plenum/server/replica.py, that file tries to import node.py, which tries to import primary_selector.py, which tries to import replica.py, which fails.

Hi all! I am trying get up and running with indy and I'm following the "how-tos" on writing a did and querying a verkey.
I seem to be having some trouble here. I'm using python, on MacOSX, and running the python file "write_did.py" results in an error 
`ErrorCode: Pool Genesis Transactions are not compatible with Protocol version Libindy PROTOCOL_VERSION is 1 but Pool Genesis Transactions are of version 1.4`
I try adding the following to the code:
`await pool.set_protocol_version(2)`
and I get another error
`AttributeError: module 'indy.pool' has no attribute 'set_protocol_version'`
Does anyone have any advice on how to resolve this issue? 
</p>
<p><strong>gudkov</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 14:57:59 GMT):<br/>
@tylerhester You need to update to latest idny sdk master if you want the latest indy node master
</p>
<p><strong>tylerhester</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 15:02:06 GMT):<br/>
After having pulled the latest indy-sdk, I ran `cargo build` in the libindy folder, and then symlink'd the `libindy.dylib` found in /target/debug/ to /usr/local/lib. I've also exported the path to the dylib in LD_LIBRARY_PATH and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
</p>
<p><strong>tylerhester</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 15:03:56 GMT):<br/>
I'm still encountering the same issue. I feel like I'm missing something. 
</p>
<p><strong>gudkov</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 15:14:55 GMT):<br/>
you need to update python wrapper also
</p>
<p><strong>tylerhester</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 15:26:27 GMT):<br/>
Is that with `pip3 install python3-indy`?
</p>
<p><strong>gudkov</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 15:52:32 GMT):<br/>
> pip3 install python3-indy

this command install the latest stable version. To install master you need to provide exact version
</p>
<p><strong>gudkov</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 15:53:30 GMT):<br/>
1.4.0-dev-591
</p>
<p><strong>tylerhester</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 16:03:56 GMT):<br/>
Awesome! That got it working again. Thank you :)

Did you try it with `sudo vagrant up`?

@ryanwest6 I then started vagrant SHH cli01 to prompt me to perform under the same level of user

@Qiu Once a new NYM with verkey is onboarded (by a TRUST_ANCHOR), which means that the person this NYM belongs to owns the corresponding private key (this private key must be unknown for the party doing onboarding, that is the Trust Anchor!), then only the person the NYM belongs to can update the NYM (rotate keys for example). No one else (including the Trust Anchor who onboarded the NYM) can do this. This is one of the principles of self-sovereign identity (SSI).

Vagrant was unable to communicate with the guest machine within
the configured ("config.vm.boot_timeout" value) time period.

If you look above, you should be able to see the error(s) that
Vagrant had when attempting to connect to the machine. These errors
are usually good hints as to what may be wrong.

If you're using a custom box, make sure that networking is properly
working and you're able to connect to the machine. It is a common
problem that networking isn't setup properly in these boxes.
Verify that authentication configurations are also setup properly,
as well.

If the box appears to be booting properly, you may want to increase
the timeout ("config.vm.boot_timeout") value.

Hi Everyone, I'm trying to run a script that create wallet and credential transactions for users and organisation from a .csv dataset : 
Is there a way to export/import wallet and ledger to re-use them whenever I run my script ? (at the moment I have to onboard and create wallets for all agents and it takes about 2hours, it makes debugging very very long...)
</p>

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 02:48:12 GMT):<br/>
@K.Amine - wallet export/import is coming in the next release (Indy-SDK 1.5). You can just backup and restore the wallet file today.  However, you do have to keep the wallet in-sync with the ledger and that can get tricky. You can use seeds to make the ledger sync up with an existing wallet for DIDs, however when you create a CredDef, it internally creates a public/private keypair without a seed, so if you have to sync a CredDef between the wallet and the ledger you are out of luck. As a result, you are generally stuck with how you are doing it.  It would be really good if you could use a Seed with a CredDef.

I'm not sure about how you would go about snapshotting the ledger and wallets at the same time to enable a known startpoint for a test.

We suggest using Docker to run the test pool instead, which is much more likely to work without error. https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk#how-to-start-local-nodes-pool-with-docker

@ltzMaxwell - von-image is available from the BC Gov on hub.docker.com. It contains both indy-node and indy-sdk in the image and has been optimized for size.  Docker: https://hub.docker.com/r/bcgovimages/von-image/  - github repo for the image is here - https://github.com/PSPC-SPAC-buyandsell/von-image

There is also von-network which makes it easy to spin up a new Sovrin network - https://github.com/bcgov/von-network

The previous problem's been solved, it's a connection issue due to VPN.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 14:59:08 GMT):<br/>
Yup...spinning up a network is easy, and problems tend to be in two areas - IP address between the two systems (e.g. on Windows getting the correct DOCKERHOST IP, VPNs, etc.) and mismatched client/node versions.

Hello everyone, just new to Indy, internally in my company we would like to set up a test env and start playing with it. Could everyone point me out at the right resource in order to do that or, even better, provide me a comprehensive lists of tasks that should be done for having an indy env up & running?

Hi @LuigiRiva, you are looking for the #indy-sdk channel. www.github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk has information on how to set up a test network with Docker, though it is still deep in development.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-node?msg=QhhK5ySjfgEnDRQuE) @smithbk I believe in the ticket there is a clear answer. You have changed port in genesis transactions that caused different merkle trees on client and on ledger side. What additional help do you want?
</p>
<p><strong>gudkov</strong> (Tue, 10 Jul 2018 08:18:56 GMT):<br/>
To help you we need the list of steps that you performed from the very beginning. Remove all images. Start from scratch and document all steps you performed.

Hello,

<p><strong>Abhishek_Tyagi</strong> (Wed, 11 Jul 2018 06:51:34 GMT):<br/>
Hello,
I have completed network set-up using "Vagrant up". I have tried to understand how Indy works using CLI01, Validator01/02/03/04 and Agent01/02/03 but could not understand the architecture. Some of my questions are:
- Where the Public keys are stored and how to look for them?
- How Acme Corp. know that the Proof Request was fulfilled with the correct previous claim(i.e. Faber transcript)?
- How to run the network again and revive all the history after closing the network once (for ex. If I sign out from CLI01 and agents today and then tomorrow I want to continue from where I last left, is it possible?)

Moreover, I now want to customize the nodes (My own agents instead of Faber, Acme or Thrift, and my own indy files). 
Would anyone please care to explain how to proceed further?

Thanks,
</p>

Does anyone know were we got the python3 packages on 'https://repo.sovrin.org/deb/pool/xenial/stable/p/'. 
The python3-psutil broke my system. It is not compatible with mint 19. I would expect all distributions to have many if not all of these common python Debian packages. I doubt we want to sign up to make sure that these packages work for all system that could install them. Is there a reason we don't use the package from the distribution?

@PeterX 
Please use docker to start the nodes https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/tree/master/environment/docker/pool

If you (for some reasons) still want to run a node locally, then, as mentioned in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/stable/docs/start-nodes.md, 
```
the following needs to be added: NETWORK_NAME={network_name} where {network_name} matches the one in genesis transaction files above
```
So, you need to add `NETWORK_NAME='sandbox'` to ``/etc/indy/indy_config.py`
</p>

Hi all , I have a question about add a new node to a existed node pool, described as below:
I have created a node pool follow the document: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/stable/docs/start-nodes.md
Now the pool has four nodes: Node1, Node2, Node3, Node4

1. Use "send NODE" command with indy cli to add "Node5"

2. After add Node5, I found there is errro log on Node1, Node2, Node3, Node4, like below:
2018-07-25 05:47:00,050|ERROR|node.py|Node1 commit failed for batch request, error PublicKeyNotFoundOnDisk("Node1 could not get Node5's public key from disk. 
Make sure the keys are initialized for this remote or provided explicitly.",)

3. The I use "init_indy_node Node5 0.0.0.0 9709 0.0.0.0 9710" to generate keys.

4. After generate keys for Node5, I found the keys are generated on /var/lib/indy/localpool/keys/Node5 folder, but in /var/lib/indy/localpool/keys/Node1, there is
still no key file about Node5, so in Node1 there are still error like: raise PublicKeyNotFoundOnDisk(self.name, name)
stp_core.network.exceptions.PublicKeyNotFoundOnDisk: Node1 could not get Node5's public key from disk. Make sure the keys are initialized for this remote or provide
d explicitly.

Anyone know what's going wrong? or any materials or documents about adding a new node to existed node pool? Many thanks for your help.

Hi @PeterX, what did you mean by "add Node5" ?
Run command in CLI is not enough. Please check that you didn't miss these steps:
1) copy pool_transactions_genesis file from one of existing node to %node5_host%:/var/lib/indy/%network_name%/
2) copy domain_transactions_genesis file to %node5_host%:/var/lib/indy/localpool/
3) NODE5: run "init_indy_node Node5 0.0.0.0 9709 0.0.0.0 9710"
4) CLI: use existing Trustee DID for new Steward DID creation
5) CLI: use new Steward DID for "ledger node" sending
6) NODE5: run "systemctl start indy_node" to start up Node service
If you still have problems - please contact me directly
</p>

Hi all, I have read a doc about node pool upgrade: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/pool-upgrade.md, but there is no operation steps that describe how to upgrade a existed node pool, is anyone can share a doc about the operation steps?

</p>
<p><strong>zhigunenko.dsr</strong> (Thu, 26 Jul 2018 10:36:14 GMT):<br/>
@PeterX sorry for the delayed response
about new CLI - you can't just open another program and continue work. You need create pool again (names no matters) and migrate your wallet if needed (see script here https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/cli/README.md )
about node pool upgrade - you can just type "ledger pool-upgrade help" in your CLI (syntax is for new indy-cli)
</p>
<p><strong>PeterX</strong> (Thu, 26 Jul 2018 10:45:18 GMT):<br/>
@zhigunenko.dsr , thanks for your response, I want to confirm one thing, "You need create pool again " means I need to create another node pool? or I can use the existed node pool, and just need migrate my wallet?
</p>
<p><strong>zhigunenko.dsr</strong> (Thu, 26 Jul 2018 10:55:35 GMT):<br/>
you can use the existed pool, but before connect you need type something like "pool create localpool gen_txn_file=./indy_cli/networks/localpool/pool_transactions_genesis"
</p>
<p><strong>zhigunenko.dsr</strong> (Thu, 26 Jul 2018 10:55:35 GMT):<br/>

@zhigunenko.dsr , thanks for your help. I have connected my localpool with new indy-cli successfully, when I try to upgrade my node pool, I found there is a required param "sha256 - Sha256 hash of the package.", do you know how to get the sha256 of a package? BTW, my current indy node version is “indy-node                             1.4.66”.
</p>
<p><strong>zhigunenko.dsr</strong> (Thu, 26 Jul 2018 12:32:07 GMT):<br/>
@PeterX at this moment it doesn't matter, you can include any valid sha256 hash
</p>
<p><strong>PeterX</strong> (Thu, 26 Jul 2018 12:42:46 GMT):<br/>
@zhigunenko.dsr , got it, I will have a try.
</p>
<p><strong>PeterX</strong> (Thu, 26 Jul 2018 12:57:23 GMT):<br/>
@zhigunenko.dsr , one more question what to ask you, about the package version, my current indy-node version is 1.4.66, which is the latest stable version, so can I use the master version as the upgrade target version? like "indy-node_1.5.511_amd64.deb "?
</p>
<p><strong>zhigunenko.dsr</strong> (Thu, 26 Jul 2018 13:01:09 GMT):<br/>
@PeterX yes, but you will do it at your own risk. you can switch from stable repo to master, but success is probable, but not guaranteed. Also master is a branch under development, so you can face with some fresh bugs

We are now able to designate 2 IP addresses, on 2 NICs, for incoming traffic on a validator, one for client traffic, and one for inter-node traffic.  My question is, which of these IP addresses is used for outgoing communications to the other validators?
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Thu, 26 Jul 2018 20:18:53 GMT):<br/>
Question 2: How do we change a Node that was configured to use 1 IP address to use 2 instead?  If we just add lines to /etc/indy/indy.env will that be all that is needed to make the change as far as Indy is concerned? I.e.:
NODE_CLIENT_IP=10.20.30.205
NODE_CLIENT_PORT=10.20.30.206
Obviously there will be changes needed in routing tables, etc., in addition.

Hi @danielhardman, have the Indy released for production use?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Fri, 27 Jul 2018 15:34:33 GMT):<br/>
The first network that uses Indy became available to the world in a provisional state in July 2017. At that time, the Indy codebase was given a 1.0 version number, because it had been wholly built within Sovrin, and Sovrin believed that it had reached 1.0 quality. The code was good enough to guarantee that permanent identities could be built upon it, and never lost. However, the Sovrin network itself (not its code) was given a "provisional" status because there were some legalities that needed time to mature, and because the deployment of the code wasn't ready for crushing traffic.

Now, at that time, the code had just been transferred to Hyperledger as the Indy codebase, and Hyperledger doesn't like to assign 1.0 version numbers while projects are still in incubation. So from a Hyperledger perspective, giving the code a 1.0 version was a bit surprising.

We've worked hard to mature the code for an additional year now, and I personally think it's reasonable to build production systems upon it. Evernym (the company I work for) is doing so. The code has been released multiple times (on a semi-regular cadence), and its stability and security posture are moderately well understood. However, it is not officially out of Hyperledger's incubation status (though it's close). Whether it meets the needs of a particular production deployment scenario is something you will have to judge for yourself by reading the jira issues and inspecting the release notes of indy-node and indy-sdk.

@danielhardman thanks, Daniel. I will keep looking into it.

I used to (before move from Sovrin to Indy) be able to run the `getting_started.py` (which is now in `indy-node/indy_client/test/training/`). But now, this just does not work and there are many error popping. I realise that there is a new `getting_started.py` in the `indy-sdk` project but its implementation is completely different. In particular it does not seem to have the concept of agents. Besides the `indy-agent` project has not been updated for months... so what's you recommendation to build a simple demo with a ledger running on docker and and few agents talking to each other running a separate processes?

Hi @fabienpe, we are trying to clean up our repositories to reduce confusion when developers get started. Right now, one of the best ways to bootstrap your knowledge of the indy code is to read through the code and run the demos in our python wrapper folder: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/wrappers/python

Currently Indy Node is only tested with Ubuntu 16.04. We want to upgrade to 18.04, remove the dependencies on specific versions of specific packages, and support a broader range of systems. But currently we aren't surprised to hear that there are problems with other platforms, especially newer ones.

<p><strong>baconsandwich</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 11:18:52 GMT):<br/>
Is this the place to ask questions specific to Plenum?
</p>
<p><strong>baconsandwich</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 13:11:26 GMT):<br/>
OK, I am just gonna ask. I am trying to understand what Plenum is using for communication between the nodes. The README.md says its RAET, the main.md says its CurveZMQ. Afaiu CurveZMQ uses ZeroMQ, or in other words, is a layer on top of ZeroMQ. So is ZeroMQ also an implementation of RAET? I am trying to consolidate all these statements. 
</p>
<p><strong>baconsandwich</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 13:13:09 GMT):<br/>
In the indy-plenum code I only found references to ZeroMQ, which adds to the confusion.
</p>
<p><strong>RyanWest</strong> (Wed, 15 Aug 2018 02:18:35 GMT):<br/>
I believe RAET has been removed from the code, but has not been removed from the wiki yet (correct me if I'm wrong). This should be updated. 
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Wed, 15 Aug 2018 06:37:24 GMT):<br/>
@baconsandwich 
ZeroMQ is the only supported secure transport in plenum. RAET was deprecated and removed from the code.

I am trying to find a definitive answer to what identity data (relevant to the users) is stored on the ledger. Can you confirm that
1. Only the domain ledger needs to be considered, because the other two only store data that is relevant to the ledger itself.
2. https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/transactions.md#domain-ledger shows all the transactions and therefore this is the exhausting listing of all data that will be stored on the ledger.
I need to know for sure which data would be public (in the ledger).
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 13:37:43 GMT):<br/>
@baconsandwich - I would agree that the domain ledger is the only relevant one to your question.  What you mean by "identity data (relevant to the user)" is not exactly clear, but the document you reference contains most of the transactions, and hence data, stored on the domain ledger. I don't see on that page information about revocation data, but not none of that data can be tied to a user - because of how revocation is handled.  But if you are trying to answer "What's on the ledger", the document you are looking at is pretty accurate.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 13:39:21 GMT):<br/>
One more note is that the "nym" related data - the DID - is likely in the future to be mostly stored off ledger - data shared directly by the two identities that exchanged the pairwise DIDs.  That reduces the volume of data going on the public ledger.  The DID data is the same, just the volume will be lower.
</p>
<p><strong>baconsandwich</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 13:44:27 GMT):<br/>
basically I am trying to understand what data that is somehow related to a user or his identity is stored on the ledger, so nodes would be irrelevant but did or verkey would be relevant
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 13:46:23 GMT):<br/>
OK - then it's really the DID data and the Cred Def (with related revocation data).  The Schema is just that, a schema so is to user related.
</p>
<p><strong>baconsandwich</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 13:46:28 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-node?msg=CYibpoQvChfZXyka6) @swcurran I don't understand, the DID is going to be stored off-ledger?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 13:50:51 GMT):<br/>
Some DIDs will be on ledger.  The idea is that if I create a connection with you and we exchange DIDs and related data (the DIDDoc), no one else is going to use that DID or DIDDoc to contact me, so I don't need to make it public.  When I update a DIDDoc (e.g. rotate a key, add a key), I need to replicate that change to whatever copies of the DIDDoc are out there - either on the public ledger or on a microledger that I have with you.  Since I am managing my copies of the data locally in my wallet (e.g. a data store), I can use that as the basis of the microledgers I keep with many other identities.
</p>
<p><strong>baconsandwich</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 13:53:20 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran And at the moment this DID pair between us would be stored on the ledger?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 14:08:01 GMT):<br/>
@baconsandwich yes.

However, if all of one's peer-to-peer relationships DIDs where on the ledger it increases the probabilities that it along perhaps with network traffic data and so forth could be used to perform coorelation

Apparently ... the prevailing GDPR opinion is that DID and DIDDoc type data is considered personal data ... maybe @drummondreed or @nage can provide more details on that

Hi everyone! I've started playing around with indy, but I need your help to clarify a few points. Thanks a lot in advance!!!

1. Looking at genesis files in Sovrin repo here https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/tree/master/sovrin what's the difference between `domain_transactions_*` files and `pool_transactions_*`? It seems that those "domain" files have "role" field specifying stewards/trustees, but unlike "pool" files, they don't contain specific IP addresses. What are the use cases for these 2 kinds of genesis files?

2. I wanted to connect to Sovrin live using indy-cli. So I've created pool configuration like this:
```
pool create live gen_txn_file="/Users/patrikstas/dev/hyperledger/sovrin/sovrin/pool_transactions_live_genesis"
``` 
pointing to the sovrin genesis file https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/blob/master/sovrin/pool_transactions_live_genesis however, when I try to connect, I can't:
```
indy> pool connect live
Pool "live" has not been connected.
```
Also, can I increase logging level for `indy-cli` so I could get some more info?

3. In the `pool_transactions_*` genesis files, there is concept of "node" and "client".
```
"client_ip":"127.0.0.1","client_port":9702,"node_ip":"127.0.0.1","node_port":9701,
```
I suppose node represents the service running indy-node https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/ verifying transactions. What does the *client* service represents and what do I use it for?

@PatrikStas 
1: There are multiple ledgers, Domain Ledger (with txns like NYM, SCHEMA, ATTRIB, etc.), which is the main one for users data. and Pool Ledger, where information about the Nodes is stored (NODE txn). So, there are two genesis txn files (one for Domain ledger containing initial/gensis NYM txns, that is initial Trustees in the system, and one for the Pool ledger containing initial Nodes in the pool, that is NODE txns)
3: Indy Node service has 2 network interfaces: for node-to-node communication (consensus protocol), defined by node_ip and node_port, and for client-to-node communication (defined by client_ip, client_port), which receives requests and transactions from clients

@ashcherbakov Thanks a lot, that's very helpful. Is there anything you could add up to the 2nd point? Basically, since there are actually 2 ledgers, pool ledger and domain ledger, how can I connect to Sovrin network? 
In case of the dockerized pool example (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/cli/docker_pool_transactions_genesis), there is only single genesis file to work with, which seems to contain the "pool ledger transactions". It seems like something is shaded away from the user for sake of simplicity in the case of the dockerized pool example, as there's only 1 genesis file to work with.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-node?msg=YDLhKE2rPJwiokdYK) @ashcherbakov Is "client" equivalent to agent (indy-agent) here or are there other type of entities that would use client-to-node communication?
</p>
<p><strong>baconsandwich</strong> (Wed, 22 Aug 2018 12:03:58 GMT):<br/>
Where can I get information for potential real-world deployments of indy regarding the following: Let's say several companies are using it to have a common set of users, claims etc. Should all of them run a node? Should each of them run multiple nodes? Or in what case would I decide to only run an observer node and not a validator node?  Since there is not proof-of-work, running a validator node should be cheap. Is it just about trust then and I only allow very trusthworhty companies to be a steward? Would each company have an agent? And could an agent of a company access the (steward) node of another company? Is there documentation or info regarding how this all would make sense?

I need to find a way to
(1) start the `indy_pool` that ships with indy-sdk on indy-node protocol 1.3
(2) register some trust anchors, have Issuer issue some credentials [with revocation support]
(3) upgrade the pool to indy-node protocol 1.4
(4) have Prover create proof, Verifier verify it

I've found `ledger.build_pool_upgrade_request()` and `ledger.build_pool_restart_request()`, but it looks like the update request cannot backdate. Also, is there any further documentation on these parameters? For example, what is the sha256 hash of?
If I can't backdate, and must start from an indy-node pool on 1.3, how does the ledger know how to find 1.4? Is it otherwise possible to configure the pool to start with 1.3 instead of 1.4?

One bet: tweak the indy-pool.dockerfile (which versions marked `?` will work here?)
```
ARG indy_plenum_ver=?
ARG indy_anoncreds_ver=?
ARG indy_node_ver=1.3.62
ARG python3_indy_crypto_ver=?
ARG indy_crypto_ver=?
```
, build docker image, docker run it, then figure out what magic values (name, sha256) to pass the upgrade call?

I could really use some guidance here.

@sklump You can use POOL_UPGRADE txn (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/requests.md#pool_upgrade) to update the pool from 1.3.x to the latest 1.6.x (I recommend to do the upgrade to the latest version, not to 1.4.x).
*Please note that for this particular upgrade force flag must True and all times in schedule must be the same, so that Upgrade is simultaneous*
name can be anything. sha256 can also be anything (not supported yet)
Please note that only a Trustee can send the Pool Upgrade txn.

The Pool Upgrade txn will upgrade all the nodes to the latest (specified one) version, and will call auto migration scripts that will migrate all ledger data to the new format.

An example with the old Indy CLI (distributed with IndyNode):
```
send POOL_UPGRADE name=upgrade-2
 version=1.6.71 sha256=f6f2ea8f45d8a057c9566a33f99474da2e5c6a6604d736121650e2730c6fb0a3 action=start force=True schedule={'Gw6pDLhcBcoQesN72qfotTgFa7cbuqZpkX3Xo6pLhPhv': '2017-08-11T11:45:00.000000+00:00',

Anyone have a guess how to fix it? I am guessing that it's bound to the local box?

<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 19:05:35 GMT):<br/>
I don't know what 30003 is - maybe a port I have to open up somehow?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 07:35:08 GMT):<br/>
Yes, node control tool is a separate process listening to the port 30003 for Upgrade events. So, please make sure that node control tool is up and is listening to that port.

I have to create a ticket for this in Jira. There is definitely a wrong required base58 version. If I hot-swap pip install base58==0.2.4 underneath the node control tool on the docker container to match the dependency in indy-plenum, the migration script 1_3_396_to_1_3_397.py chokes with a stack trase ending in
```

    _alphabet = set(base58.alphabet.decode("utf-8"))

```
and I see that base58.py v0.2.4 had alphabet as a `str` where v1.0.0 has it as a `bytes`.

How do I get the indy-pool in indy-node to run protocol 1.3? I'm running with `git checkout 1.3.62-stable` but `client_for_pool_start.sh` still spins up

@sklump 
I think you can just get the latest master version, and manually specify the desired versions in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/environment/docker/pool/core.ubuntu.dockerfile#L23
like 
`RUN apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y indy-anoncreds==1.0.11 indy-crypto==0.4.0 python3_indy_crypto_ver==0.4.0 indy-plenum==1.2.42 indy-node==1.3.62`

Using indy-sdk, I can get this pool to schedule the upgrade, but then it doesn't actually upgrade. Further requests are invalid ( ` InvalidClientRequest(\"Upgrade 'upgrade-pool' is already scheduled\",)" `, but no upgrade proceeds. I'm stripping it down to one node to see if that helps.

<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 05 Sep 2018 13:38:04 GMT):<br/>
One bad thing: running `indy-node/environment/docker/pool/pool_start.sh` starts a docker network, `pool-network`, that knocks out DNS on my guest OS. That probably prevents the docker container from finding any hosts it needs to implement the upgrade.

I have no idea how this might come to pass but it's reproducible. I hope you have a better experience upgrading the live network, but this is where I step off.

The pool-network is 10.0.0.0/8, which clobbers my name service at 10.17.<...>. I will replace it with a less greedy 10.0.0.0/24 and see what happens.

<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 05 Sep 2018 15:04:56 GMT):<br/>
Another bad thing:

A cred def against node protocol 1.3 uses no tag. Now if my issuer wants to find it programmatically on a node pool that has upgraded to 1.4 or higher, it will be in the wallet but under something that is no longer a cred def id. It won't find it on the ledger either.

This might be partially my own deficient code that needs a workaround.

@sklump - so scenario is

* Create a CredDef using a 1.3 Node Pool and Indy-SDK 1.6 client
* Upgrade the Node Pool to 1.4 (or 1.6)
* The CredDef cannot be found in the wallet (no tag) and cannot be retrieved from the Node Pool.

The same scenario entirely on a 1.4 (or 1.6) Node Pool works fine.

How do you find the CredDef on the 1.4/1.6 Node Pool?

I'm not sure what breaks and what doesn't, since I've only just been able to get the pool to upgrade and then force the new genesis transaction format into the test code.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 05 Sep 2018 15:36:43 GMT):<br/>
cred def on 1.3 looks like `Q4zqM7aXqm7gDQkUVLng9h:3:CL:18`
and on 1.4, `Q4zqM7aXqm7gDQkUVLng9h:3:CL:18:tag`. Note trailing tag. Revocation registry id builds on cred def id.

I'm not sure what breaks and what doesn't, since I've only just been able to get the pool to upgrade and then force the new genesis transaction format into the test code.

<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 05 Sep 2018 15:39:44 GMT):<br/>
But the issuer at least finds what was a lynchpin of cache indexation, credentials, revocation registry, and tails file processing is no longer a cred def. Could it issue new credentials against a cred def on an id that is not a cred def id anymore? What about the ones it had issued and/or revoked before? There is a galaxy of stuff to trace and troubleshoot. It will take longer to get an OK than it will to push indy node 1.4 or higher everywhere and quietly drop 1.3 support.

Agree you shouldn't do coding to deal with this.  I'm more interested in what the Indy Team's response is - both for this situation, and what they are testing in the future.  They may get by on this release, but I don't think it works from here on out.

> cred def on 1.3 looks like `Q4zqM7aXqm7gDQkUVLng9h:3:CL:18`
> and on 1.4, `Q4zqM7aXqm7gDQkUVLng9h:3:CL:18:tag`. Note trailing tag. Revocation registry id builds on cred def id.
> I'm not sure what breaks and what doesn't, since I've only just been able to get the pool to upgrade and then force the new genesis transaction format into the test code.

This is expected, since Indy Node 1.4 contained breaking changes, and one of this changes (see https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/1.3_to_1.4_migration_guide.md) is adding a new field TAG at the end of Cred Def ID.
So, you can fix it on app level just by appending either a valid tag or a default tag ('tag').
Please note, that all CRED_DEF txns that were present in 1.3 will be migrated (when updating to 1.4) to contain the tag field. That's why apps will need to specify it to be able to query.
The tag is needed to distinguish CRED_DEFS created by the same DID for the same Schema.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-node?msg=QGGe7t7BqJ9Dknpre) @RyanWest Yes thanks - the problem was the node pool's docker network (10.0.0.0/8) covered my DNS server at 10.17.26.150 or whatever. Once I pared back its subnet to 10.0.0.0/24, the upgrade process's use of DNS (via apt-get) could proceed.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-node?msg=itPWR5kavChEuWfSD) @ashcherbakov When the migration process to 1.4 updates CRED_DEF txns from 1.3, what will it use for the tag? I can't be understanding you correctly - I thought that ledger entries were supposed to be immutable?
Will the migration process also fix all txns using a revocation registry identifier (<issuer-did>:4:<issuer-did>:3:CL:<schema-seq-no> *:<cred-def-id-tag>* :CL_ACCUM:<rev-reg-id-tag>) ? Again, how will it know what to use for the cred def id tag?

Yes, migration script changes the transaction format (but not data) to support this (the last) breaking change.
For CRED_DEF and corresponding REVOC_REG_DEFs, it add a default tag value. The default tag value is `tag`

@ashcherbakov thanks - credentials already in the wallet since their issue against a cred def circa protocol version 1.3, however, won't have the same cred def id as their cred def on the ledger after a migration to 1.4? I will have to do some investigation. I am still recommending not to issue credentials to a node pool running 1.3 and expect them to persist through a migration. Te von_anchor code base relies heavily on cred def ids to index all kinds of stuff. In hindsight, that was a mistake on my part - I should have realized the impact and run them through some kind of canonicalization process. I think the safest thing to do from our point of view is to wait for 1.4+ everywhere. It won't be long now in any case.

I can see 3 options here:
1) Do not use 1.3 node/client for issuance and use >= 1.4
2) Have a fix on Indy Node side that will check if TAG field is empty in GET_CLAIM_DEF requests and append a default value when querying
3) Have a fix on Indy SDK side that will check if TAG field is empty in GET_CLAIM_DEF requests and append a default value when querying. This fix will not work if revocation is needed (since a ref to claim def in revoc txn still be the same)

If we decide to go with 2 or 3, we will need to issue a hot fix release.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 12:42:38 GMT):<br/>
For what it's worth, I vote #1. It carries the least project risk. #2 and #3 introduce a push for new code to bring a few weeks of functionality at most, which then becomes dead code forever. A bit of patience will provide the best solution.

Docker indy_pool: running the docker file from sdk/ci and using the genesis file there:
I am unable to ledger a did if I use the seed : 000000000000000000000000Steward1 because I am not authorized,
but if I use 000000000000000000000000Trustee1 it works.

1. I was under the assumption that the Steward had the role and ability to ledger DIDs, or is the case that the steward was not part of the genesis transactions?

2. Would the Trustee alway be part of the genesis transactions and the steward did added after start up? Strange, because I thought that Stewards would run the nodes.

@sklump @ashcherbakov 

Here are some investigation on Node 1.3 to 1.4 migration. I looked to the proposed plan and I have a feeling that we can avoid re-issuing of credentials and cred def keys during Node 1.3 -> 1.4 migration. Some background information:

* Indy Node 1.3 (protocol version 1) uses the tuple (ISSUER_DID, SCHEMA_SEQ_NO) as an identifier of CRED_DEF
* Indy Node 1.4 (protocol version 2) uses the tuple (ISSUER_DID, SCHEMA_SEQ_NO, TAG) as an identifier of CRED_DEF
* The tag was introduced to allow posting multiple credential definitions from the one issuer DID
* During upgrade to 1.4 Indy Node performs migration and adds tag field with the value "TAG" to all credential definition txns
* Libindy 1.6 returns (ISSUER_DID, SCHEMA_SEQ_NO, TAG) as an ID of credential definition.
* When credential is posted to the ledger with protocol version 1 tag field will be removed from the txn
* When we looking of credential on the ledger with protocol version 1 tag field will be removed from the request, but as Node 1.3 supports only one cred def per DID it doesn't matter and correct cred def keys will be returned. The only problem is that tag field will be empty in response, but it doesn’t matter if libindy response parsers are used.

As a result if issuer uses libindy 1.6 and tag=TAG for issuance of credentials resolving of cred def keys should work fine for Node 1.3 and Node 1.4 after migration.

If different from "TAG" tag was used for credential definition creation it is still possible to recovery. Issuer just need to re-post cred def transaction of upgrading Node to 1.4.

hi - does anyone know if there is a way to "explore" the chain behind hyperledger indy? For example is there a way to see the individual transactions on the merkle tree ?
something like when you do a "get-nym" command on indy-cli and get an output but show a list of entries instead of just one entry ?

@Tvrtko if you are a steward and log into your validator node, you can use "sudo read_ledger --type domain" to see transactions. Default is to show the first 100 transactions, but there are flags to control this.
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Fri, 09 Nov 2018 15:59:57 GMT):<br/>
I know that you can also fetch an arbitrary transaction using the sdk, but I don't think this functionality has been exposed in the cli

In what way are the three ledgers (pool, config, domain) separated? I suppose they all run on each node. Are they differente processes? Is consensus calculated independently? Where can I find more info about this?

<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 06:21:13 GMT):<br/>
@baconsandwich 
- All ledgers are present on all nodes. 
- Indy-node is a single-process service, so all ledgers are in the same process. - Each ledger has its own key-value storages (for transaction logs and merkle tree). 
- RocksDB is used as a key-value storage
- you can read more in docs folder, in particular https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/docs/storage.md

Do observer nodes need some kind of authentication to read the ledgerl? Afaik validator nodes can only be added by stewards. The [role spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TWXF7NtBjSOaUIBeIH77SyZnawfo91cJ_ns4TR-wsq4/edit#gid=0) says "later". But in general, will someone else have to add an observer or can I just participate like that, as in bitcoin for example. Has this been discussed yet?

Hello everybody. We have finally removed old client code, which was merged with our plenum & node codebases. For now the only way to connect to ledger and send transactions is Indy SDK (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk). Old getting started guide is deprecated too. You can find new one at https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/getting-started/getting-started.md

<p><strong>smithbk</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 16:32:53 GMT):<br/>
Hi, I have a general question about the relationship between the multiple ledgers.  Is the processing of a transaction on the domain ledger dependent upon data from the config ledger?  If yes, doesn't that introduce non-determinism when processing a transaction on the domain ledger which could result in a split?  For example, suppose config transaction C and domain transaction D are submitted at about the same time, where some nodes perform C and then D while other nodes perform D and then C.  Couldn't this cause different results for transaction D on different nodes?  Thanks

<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 06:08:20 GMT):<br/>
@smithbk 
The purpose of consensus algorithm implemented in Plenum is to make sure that all nodes have transactions ordered in the same order for all ledgers.
The Primary proposes the next transactions to be ordered. The transactions are ordered by batches, and 1 batch can contain transactions from one ledger only.
So, this makes the process deterministic. Moreover, dynamic validation (and comparing of root hashes) is part of consensus algorithm, so during ordering we also make sure that all data is consistent.
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 06:11:20 GMT):<br/>
@JamieLi 
https://github.com/ashcherbakov/indy-plenum/blob/master/storage/kv_store_rocksdb_int_keys.py#L26 - it has read_only flag passed there, and as I know it works (that's why, for example, validator_info works from a different process). Do you see any cases when it doesn't work? Is there a test for this?
</p>
<p><strong>smithbk</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 21:51:59 GMT):<br/>
@ashcherbakov Thanks much.  Another related question pls.  Is there a way to query values from the ledger at some time (or logical time) in the past?  My ultimate goal is for two verifiers to be guaranteed to get the same verification result, but this requires that they get the same info from the ledger when performing verification even though they ask at different times.
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 23:19:11 GMT):<br/>
@smithbk there is a timestamp on each transaction, this is generally exposed to client queries. For example, I get this from the CLI when I query for a NYM:

@mgbailey Thanks.  Yes, I knew there was a time stamp in each transaction and so the raw data is there to determine what the values were at some time in the past, but I'm wondering if there is a ledger or SDK API automatically determines what the values were by walking the blocks/transactions for you.

Yes, every txn (reply) has a timstamp guaranteed by consensus. 
In general, this is up to application to check how fresh the result is. But Indy-SDK is going to have more API to help in verifying the freshness of the timestamp soon (the work is started this sprint)

@HiranKumar 
Indy requires Ledger for getting a Public Key (CRED_DEF) for credentials verification.
In principle, omne can use just verifiable credentials crypto (see Hyperledger Ursa or Hyperlddger indy-crypto).
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Wed, 05 Dec 2018 07:17:30 GMT):<br/>
@dnnn 
Every write request (transaction) to the Ledger must be signed by a sender (using a key associated with a DID stored on the ledger; so every sender needs to have a DID on the ledger).
`reqSignature`  is the sender's signarture against the request (transaction), We store it in the Ledger together  with the content.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-node?msg=7qgtJZt4J89jajJMh) @ashcherbakov Hi Alexander, and big thanks for the answer! what signature should be specified for genesis transaction file when you initially start the network with the first nodes (for example 4) in it? In `indy-sdk` examples I have seen  `genesis_txn` files with empty `reqSignature` field. Is it legit to have it empty for those transactions for genesis nodes?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Wed, 05 Dec 2018 08:39:19 GMT):<br/>

Yes, for genesis txns this is fine to have no (absent) reqSignature
</p>

@ashcherbakov thanks! also if you do not mind I have a question regarding provided `init_indy_keys` script. for example, when I run it during debian `indy-node` installation process for node named `node_a` as an output I get every needed public key for `genesis_txn` file (which will contain `node_a` as a genesis node). If my understanding is correct `init_indy_keys` also generate private keys. My question is how private keys are managed and where `init_indy_keys` scripts put them?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Wed, 05 Dec 2018 08:51:24 GMT):<br/>
yes, private keys are also created. They are stored in `/var/lib/indy` in a file.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-node?msg=3v5iNwWYhezXHbYgH) Maybe someone else would need it. From what I found out:

- `dest` is did of the node. but it is derived not as first 16 bytes of verkey. here are steps to do it in python:
```
    from binascii import unhexlify
    # VERKEY_STRING is a "Verification key" in output of init_indy_keys script
    a = "VERKEY_STRING".encode()
    b = unhexlify(a)
    node_did = base58.b58encode(b) 
```
- `from` in metadata is `did` of the initial client specified in `domain_transactions_genesis` file
- `txnID` – transaction id. In examples it is derived as:
```
    sha256(node_name.encode()).hexdigest() 
```
where `node_name` is node's `alias` in `pool_transactions_genesis` file entry

- `dest` is did of the node. but it is derived not as first 16 bytes of verkey. here are steps to do it in python:
```
    from binascii import unhexlify
    # VERKEY_STRING is a "Verification key" in output of init_indy_keys script
    a = "VERKEY_STRING".encode()
    b = unhexlify(a)
    node_did = base58.b58encode(b) 
```
- `from` in metadata is did of the initial client specified in `domain_transactions_genesis` file
- `txnID` – in examples transaction id is derived as:

    sha256(node_name.encode()).hexdigest() 

where node_name is node's alias in pool_transactions_genesis file

Alternatively, use https://github.com/kdenhartog/indy-dev which has been designed to setup nodes locally and solve this problem. Is it common for people to want to use nodes in a cloud environment? I suppose I could support that later on.

Hi everyone, I have a question about `plugin`s. In documentation of `indy-plenum` there is a description and also an example of how it is possible to add new transactions and even new ledgers with the help of `plugin`s. If I understand correctly `indy-node` is built using `indy-plenum`. So my question is: does `plugin` mechanism exist in `indy-node` and how it can be used?

QUESTION 1a: Does an Indy/Sovrin Ledger Agent Node at a high level (but not too high a level) operate similar to an Ethereum Node (e.g. geth.exe) in the sense that when a Ledger Node starts up for the first time, it starts reading the Genesis block/Tx and then somehow maintains some sort of local store representing the current of the Ledger?

</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 19 Dec 2018 15:29:28 GMT):<br/>
@peacekeeper is the expert to answer that question in depth, but my high level answer is that the resolver uses the DID to look up the associated transactions on the Sovrin ledger (the NYM transaction to get the public (verification) key and the ATTRIB transactions to get the other DID document properties, and then the resolve dynamically composes the  DID document to return. 
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 19 Dec 2018 15:30:41 GMT):<br/>
To clarify, any client always talks to a  Sovrin ledger node to read or write data. So I don't lknow what it would mean for "a DID Resolver to run directly against the Indy/Sovrin Ledger".

@mwherman2000 - that is not a browser of the Sovrin Public network - it's a browser for the BCovrin Test Network used by BC and Ontario Gov only. AFAIK, there is no browser for the Sovrin Public Network as yet.  We've talked about standing one up using the save code as you are seeing with BCovrin, but have not yet spent the time on that.

Hi, can anyone tell me how to enable trace in indy-node?
</p>
<p><strong>smithbk</strong> (Thu, 03 Jan 2019 19:58:59 GMT):<br/>
I'm using version 1.6.7 of indy-sdk with the following versions of indy-node ```ARG indy_plenum_ver=1.6.520
ARG indy_anoncreds_ver=1.0.32
ARG indy_node_ver=1.6.576
ARG python3_indy_crypto_ver=0.4.3
ARG indy_crypto_ver=0.4.3
```
I am able to read the ledger but am getting a timeout when doing a send_nym to onboard the first trust anchor.  I don't see any output at all in the pool logs and am seeing the following indy-sdk logs in my client app

Why do many transactions have identical value of `txnMetadata.txnId` ?
This page https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/transactions.md says that:
```
txnId (string): Txn ID as State Trie key (address or descriptive data). It must be unique within the ledger.
```
however, for instance at sovrin mainnet, there's literally hunderds of transactions with `txnId` value
`UFSFjGNiain5FQ2m88dijd:1:bb485893951ed5093fc370df3671146c7e2380b493206140330f69f4c6af57fe`
Am I misunderstanding the description of txnId?

Hello, I have some questions about the Revocation Registry.
Is the Indy code using dynamic accumulators or regular ones?
When is the accumulator updated after a transaction is issued for a new credential?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 07 Jan 2019 17:57:58 GMT):<br/>
@abdfaye - this is the best document on revocation, although your first question likely needs a code review or discussion with the original developers: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0011-cred-revocation

The "nornal" case for Indy for updating the accumulator is only on revocation of one or a set of credentials.  That said, I believe that there is an option that can be used where the credentials must be activated on issuance and in that case the accumulator is updated on issuance and revocation.  I can't see the purpose for that latter model (lots of overhead), so I'd stick with the former.

@HiranKumar try to export `RUST_LOG=trace` in the execution environment where you run the application. You should see all indySDK logs and sometimes it helps discovering what exactly is the problem.
</p>
<p><strong>HiranKumar</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 11:49:49 GMT):<br/>
@PatrikStas ,How can I set this RUST_LOG?
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 11:55:11 GMT):<br/>
I suppose you are executing your application from command line shell, something like bash, right? If so, just run `export RUST_LOG=trace` in command line and then try to run your app

<p><strong>HiranKumar</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 12:05:48 GMT):<br/>
I run the command.and executed the application.But where can I see the indy trace logs?
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 13:01:49 GMT):<br/>
It should be displayed along the logs from your application. If it's not displayed, I am wondering, maybe you need to use debug build of libindy. Not entirely sure though.  
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 13:06:09 GMT):<br/>
Do you remember building libidny? Did you run `cargo build --release` ? If so, you can try build its debug version be omitting the `--release` switch. Then you have to make sure your app is using this new build. I think it might help, but beware: `Note: By default cargo build produce debug artifacts with a large amount of run-time checks. It's good for development, but this build can be in 100+ times slower for some math calculation.` (quoting indy-sdk github)
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 13:08:02 GMT):<br/>
I think we should continue in #indy-sdk, this is not the right channel for this

Hi, I am trying to add a node to an existing pool following this guide https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/add-node.md.
before running the `ledger node` command I need to get the base58 of the new node verification key
</p>
<p><strong>haniavis</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 20:11:42 GMT):<br/>
but trying this one `python3 -c "from plenum.common.test_network_setup import TestNetworkSetup; print(TestNetworkSetup.getNymFromVerkey(str.encode(‘ab78300b3a3eca0a1679e72dd1656075de9638ae79dc6469a3093ce1cc8b424f’)))"` with my verification key it outputs `binascii.Error: Non-hexadecimal digit found`

This was run on a node with indy-node 1.6.80 on it
</p>
<p><strong>haniavis</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 22:26:00 GMT):<br/>
@mgbailey I am running indy-node 1.6.82, but this doesn't work
</p>
<p><strong>haniavis</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 22:27:02 GMT):<br/>
I mean with my own verification key not with the one used in the example
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 22:35:47 GMT):<br/>
Ah, I think I know the issue. In 1.6.82 I believe that the output of init_indy node has been fixed so that it puts out base58 instead of hex. This step is now unnecessary.

I just realized that the output of the init_indy_node in indy-node 1.6.82 is different than previous versions
</p>
<p><strong>haniavis</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 22:37:20 GMT):<br/>
ok so I am ready to go with the `ledger node ` command in the cli
</p>
<p><strong>haniavis</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 22:42:06 GMT):<br/>
now working in indy-cli... it says that there is no opened pool so I connect to the pool and execute the command, but it says that "There is no opened wallet now" and when I try to open the wallet I need a key.....which one is this key?
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 22:44:26 GMT):<br/>
This is a new cli. There is good online help in it. Just type help. Then drill in and type a command or subcommand, then help.
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 22:44:43 GMT):<br/>
First connect to a pool. "pool connect"
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 22:45:05 GMT):<br/>
Actually first create it "pool create"
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 22:45:10 GMT):<br/>
then connect to it
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 22:45:26 GMT):<br/>
Next create a wallet "wallet create"
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 22:45:35 GMT):<br/>
then "wallet open"
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 22:45:59 GMT):<br/>
Then put your keys into the wallet "did new seed=xxx"
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 22:46:27 GMT):<br/>
Then you can add a new steward "ledger nym"
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 22:46:58 GMT):<br/>
and then change to the steward did "did use"
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 22:47:16 GMT):<br/>
and finally add the node information to the ledger "ledger node"
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 22:48:31 GMT):<br/>
the wallet key is something you make up in wallet create.
</p>

<p><strong>haniavis</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 22:50:26 GMT):<br/>
ok this was what I thought, but I found an existing pool and an existing wallet which I hadn't created before, I suppose they are made through the generate_indy_pool_transactions script?
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 22:51:09 GMT):<br/>
maybe. It has been forever since I have been through those steps myself
</p>
<p><strong>haniavis</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 22:51:46 GMT):<br/>

@smithbk On a VM i would check "sudo journalctl -u indy-node" to find the problem. You will need to look in your supervisord equivalent.

Hi fellas, 

1) in hyperledger indy, does the owner of the node role is steward ?
2) in hyperledger indy, in order to establish connection end user with trust anchor, does trust anchor had to host a api server to process the connection request ?
3) in hyperledger indy, what type of format or source can trust anchor provide in order to let end user get it's data such as DID , verkey for establish connection ?
</p>
<p><strong>nemesisinhell</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 12:31:56 GMT):<br/>
Question: we are thinking of scanning qr code of cloud agent from client app to establish connection with them. What info does the qr code in cloud ageny should provide and is there a standard format of how it should have?

Hello,
Where is the magic behind the Steward? Why his DID in the demos is always Th7MpTaRZVRYnPiabds81Y?
What prevents any agent turn itself a TRUST_ANCHOR?
</p>
<p><strong>misaelssantos</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 21:07:18 GMT):<br/>
How Is this set in the node pool?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 21:52:28 GMT):<br/>
@misaelssantos - the DID in the demos are always the same so that the demos can proceed - the demo startup can create the necessary Trust Anchors, etc..  That Steward is only on local/toy sandboxes - those all use the same genesis file.

On the real Sovrin networks, those are not the DIDs of the Stewards.  DIDs with the Trust Anchor role are created (currently) manually by a Sovrin Trustee upon request and only after due diligence of the person/organization asking.

That DID is created because the SEED for it is well-known and it matches what is in the genesis file that is used for sandbox networks.

Hi, I am working on a private pool installation and I am using the scirpt `generate_indy_pool_transactions` to create the pool_transactions_genesis and domain_transactions_genesis files.  After that, I see in the domain ledger a TRUSTEE is created and 2 STEWARDS. How can I manually replicate the `generate_indy_pool_transactions` script functionality and create TRUSTEEs, so that I can add STEWARDS on the ledger?
</p>
<p><strong>haniavis</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 20:17:31 GMT):<br/>
What I am trying to do is to add another node in the pool, so I need to have another STEWARD did, so I need to have the did of the TRUSTEE of the pool to add another STEWARD, am I thinking right?

@haniavis 
The minimum number of nodes in the pool is 4.
I suggest not trying to add nodes manually, but use Docker for easy start-up: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/environment/docker/pool/README.md

If you still want to initialize a pool manually, please have a look at https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/start-nodes.md

@ashcherbakov Thanks for your reply. I am using a pool with 2 nodes, and I managed to add a 3rd one. The error I mentioned above is because I used in the node request, the DID of the new node instead of the verkey of the new node. Now everything works fine. 
</p>
<p><strong>haniavis</strong> (Mon, 04 Feb 2019 15:36:56 GMT):<br/>
What do you mean the minimum number  of nodes in the pool is 4? Maybe using Docker?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Mon, 04 Feb 2019 16:09:00 GMT):<br/>
The number of nodes in the pool should be 3f+1 where f is the maximum number of failure or malicious nodes.
So, if we have a pool of 4 nodes, then 1 node can be failure/malicious.
If we have a pool of 7 nodes, then 2 nodes can be failure/malicious.
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Mon, 04 Feb 2019 16:09:18 GMT):<br/>
So, it doesn't make sense to have less than 4 nodes, since f=0 in this case
</p>
<p><strong>haniavis</strong> (Mon, 04 Feb 2019 17:30:46 GMT):<br/>
So it is not that with less than 4 nodes the pool will not be able to operate, but with less than 4 nodes the consensus algorithm will not be able to detect a malicious node, right?

Hello, when I try to create a pool using the genesis file that is in the CLI folder, I'm unable to open a pool. when I use the one provided with the Sandbox in the docker folder, I'am able to open a pool. What is the DID of the steward to use to be able to create Anchors ? Thanks

Hi all - does anyone know what utility performs the log rotation function in `/var/log/indy/sandbox` and on what schedule? Thanks in advance
</p>
<p><strong>sergey.khoroshavin</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 09:15:25 GMT):<br/>
@sudodazza by default logs are rotated once they reach 100 Mb size uncompressed. During rotation they are compressed into xz in a separate process (so that node doesn't stall for several seconds). Maximum number of allowed backups is 150 by default. You can look for actual default values in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/stp_core/config.py, and you can override them in `/etc/indy/indy_config.py`. If you want to see the actual code that does rotation - here it is: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/stp_core/common/logging/CompressingFileHandler.py

Hi all, I am experiencing troubles with installing indy-node with this command from docs: 
``` 
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 68DB5E88
sudo bash -c 'echo "deb https://repo.sovrin.org/deb xenial stable" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install indy-node
```

The problem is in indy-plenum versions mismatch:
```
The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 indy-node : Depends: indy-plenum (= 1.6.58) but 1.6.644 is to be installed
```

Could anyone share a hint on how could it be fixed?

But I guess that the `Packages` file (located here: https://repo.sovrin.org/deb/dists/xenial/stable/binary-amd64/) should be updated to resolve this issue anyway.

@dnnn 
1.6.644 is a master version, so it looks like you have both master (`https://repo.sovrin.org/deb xenial master`) and stable (`https://repo.sovrin.org/deb xenial stable`) deb repos installed. If you remove `master`, then I think everything should be fine.

It's a collection of nodes that operate an Indy network. So for example if 4 nodes (separate servers) are operating an indy network the collection of 4 nodes would be referred to as a pool.

Hi all, how can I join the global TestNet as a steward? I've got the whole procedure done up till generating a verkey, a BLS key and a PoP key by running the `sudo -i -u indy init_indy_node <alias> <node_ip> <node_port> <client_ip> <client_port>` command. Do I need someone to accreditate me, or is there a way I can do it myself?

@ruggero.montalto-tno You can run your own indy network, but to join the Sovrin Test Net, your organization needs to go through the process to be a Sovrin steward.

You can run applications that create and use Sovrin credentials without being a Sovrin steward.

@DuckLover I can answer some of your questions. Anyone is able to read off the ledger in fact it is public so if you wanted to see who was the most popular sovrin agent you would be able to scan the ledgers. When we say the sovrin ledger we mean the domain, config, and the pool ledger. The domain stores information like NYM transactions, while the config holds the configuration of the ledger. And the pool is where the add node, pool status and other transactions are kept.

Please have a look at

https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/docs/source/diagrams/storages.png

> I am interested in how the ledger is made immutable without using a blockchain
There is a merkle tree for every ledger, and the consistency of data (equal merkle tree root hashes) is part of Plenum consensus protocol, so that Plenum makes sure that all nodes have the same data.

> who can read entries
The ledger is public, so everyone can read

> So it is possible to decide to change a value in the past without computing all the following entries?
A node may try to change a value in the past, but such  change will not be accepted by other nodes and clients
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Mon, 04 Mar 2019 15:24:11 GMT):<br/>
Since the nodes sign root hashes of the merkle tree by BLS multi-signature
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Mon, 04 Mar 2019 15:26:09 GMT):<br/>
And with merkle trees any child node that is changed will result in a different root hash.

<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Mon, 04 Mar 2019 18:07:00 GMT):<br/>
@DuckLover 
Plenum is a permissioned ledger (not a permissionless like Bitcoin) which means that not everyone can become a validator Node. 
Plenum is also based on BFT consensus protocol, which supports up to f nodes being malicious (where the total number of nodes is 3f+1).
Changing a value by all nodes means that all the nodes behave maliciously.

Hey all guys! I am trying to setup an Indy pool, where I only have a trustee, a steward and a validator node. When running the generate_indy_pool_transactions script, only the node keys are saved, this means that no more steward and (hence) nodes can be added to the pool. On the other side, I tried to generate the needed keys and start a pool with only one trustee, one steward and one validator, but by debugging the indy-cli client, I found that the validator node shows a public key of [0, 0, 0]..., and the assertion rc == 0 (src/curve_client.cpp:267) stops the execution.
Apparently, the generated test pool and domain transactions (with 1 node and 0 clients) and the my pool and domain transactions look the same in structure. Nevertheless, I cannot manage to connect the indy-cli client to the pool.
Do you guys have any suggestions concerning this?

At step 3.4, you will need to use the CLI, using the Trustee keys on your network, to add the steward DID to the network, like this:

I actually already came across that document, but it somehow didn't help me in solving the problem. What I am doing is to create a genesis transaction with only one trustee and one steward ("added" by the trustee) in the domain genesis, and one node "added" by the steward in the pool genesis. As a node, I manage to connect to the pool indeed, the problem is client-side (indy-cli) when trying to connect to the pool...

You need at least 4 nodes in your genesis pool, for consensus

<p><strong>Diiaablo95</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 07:44:32 GMT):<br/>
Hey @ashcherbakov, the Docker solution is limited to a pool running locally, and the needs are to create a pool over three different organizations linked by public IP addresses, as part of a pilot project. I followed also the scripts in the second link you put, but the scripts generate a pool without giving you the keys used for the Trustee and the Stewards. Meaning that you cannot extend the pool with more nodes (as far as I understood). 
What I am trying to do, is to automate the process of setting up a distributed pool (over the Internet), in which there is an initial set of nodes, but the same initiators are also trustees and stewards, meaning that 1. they have control over their keys and 2. the pool can be extended by adding more validators and nodes at a later stage.

Hi All - quick question about the CLI.  I have a test network running in Docker and can connect to the pool within Docker from the CLI.  What I am completely missing is how to interact with the pool in the role of Trustee?  I can add a new wallet and a DID, but how to I use the role in the domain_transactions_genesis file?  Hopefully that even makes sense.  Thank you!

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-node?msg=NkiKP533khALuNrkj) @jlspector68 Hey! You need to generate the keys for the Trustee :) The test example uses the Trustee key generated by using the seed `000000000000000000000000Trustee1`. So generate the keys with `init_indy_keys --name Trustee1 --seed 000000000000000000000000Trustee1` and then import the DID of the trustee into the wallet (if you run `did import help` the cli tells you the structure of the DID).

@Diiaablo95 - help for import DID is:
did import help
Command:
        did import - Import DIDs entities from file to the current wallet.
        File format:
        {
            "version": 1,
            "dids": [{
                "did": "did",
                "seed": "UTF-8, base64 or hex string"
            }]
        }

Usage:
        did import <file-value>

Parameters are:
        file - Path to file with DIDs
</p>
<p><strong>jlspector68</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 13:12:47 GMT):<br/>
@Diiaablo95 Not sure what to import?
</p>
<p><strong>jlspector68</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 13:58:19 GMT):<br/>
@Diiaablo95 - What I ended up doing was creating a new DID in a wallet with this: did new seed=000000000000000000000000Trustee1, then did use <newly generated did> and that seems to have done the trick

 3.node.py line 3583, there is a function ‘reportSuspiciousNode()’, I think if there are some errors when nodes is handling messages, there will have an exception, which will cause this function be called. So what kind of cases will cause the exceptions?

If you're talking about a State Trie, then we have a State Trie for every ledger (Domain, Pool, Config) except Audit ledger. More details can be found here:

This tracks changes in traffic (using moving average), like suspicious spikes, that may indicate beginning of DDoS attacks. The Stewards will be notified in this case (if they set up and enable this notification).

There can be quite a lot of cases, when Primary (leader) behaves suspiciously or incorrectly, so that we send InstanceChange message to start a view change and elect a new one.
Examples of suspicious actions can be found here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/plenum/server/suspicion_codes.py

@vsadriano my guess is that you are using an old version of indy-node. The current version is 1.8.3. In older versions, init_indy_node returned the node DID in hexadecimal, which the admin then needed to convert to base58 before writing it to the ledger. This step is no longer necessary, and the conversion step has been removed from the validator prep guide.
</p>
<p><strong>vsadriano</strong> (Mon, 15 Apr 2019 15:08:53 GMT):<br/>
Yes @mgbailey! I'm using `1.6.8`. I'll try with `1.8.3`. Tks!

Hi Everyone,
I am trying to use https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain-Identity/indy-ssivc-tutorial while following those installation steps, 
I need to build the VON Network as part of installation.
So while building it by using this command `./manage build` it fails to build as it looks for particular version of indy-plenum[1.2.237] and indy-node[1.2.297] which is not even available in the version history. 
Kindly shed some light on this.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 22 Apr 2019 14:07:40 GMT):<br/>
I suspect the IBM version of the demo is using an old version of the von-network that is out of date.  Suggest that you compare the IBM version of the docker-compose file with the one in von-network itself - https://github.com/bcgov/von-network.  A warning though - I don't think the IBM tutorial has been updated in awhile, and you might need to update the network and the SDK components in the demo.

@vsadriano The verkeys for all DIDs that are in your wallet can be seen by "did list". If you want to see the verkey for something that is on the ledger, you can run "ledger get-nym did=<>"

Hello Everyone!! 
Could someone help me in stopping all docker containers for this `Hyperledger Indy` *Alice* demo project https://github.com/hyperledger/education/blob/master/LFS171x/indy-material/nodejs/README.md
I tried the following commands:
- `sudo ./manage down`
- `sudo docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)`
- `sudo docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)`
It doesn't stop it says [Check Below Attachment]

<p><strong>vsadriano</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 13:14:14 GMT):<br/>
@Raja_Sabarish you can try `docker-compose down -v`. It'll clear all docker-compose service volume.
</p>
<p><strong>Raja_Sabarish</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 13:15:47 GMT):<br/>
@vsadriano unfortuantely it fails. and it says the same error again.
</p>
<p><strong>Raja_Sabarish</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 13:16:52 GMT):<br/>
Actually `./manage down` calls `docker-compose down` itself.
</p>
<p><strong>vsadriano</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 13:16:58 GMT):<br/>
You can run docker without `sudo`:
```shell
sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)

sudo systemctl restart docker
```

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-node?msg=YfKgXsY7Fv7pTXuDL) @Raja_Sabarish That's very strange that *not* using sudo worked.  Glad it worked.  Did you use `sudo` when you ran the `./manage` command to start the example?
</p>
<p><strong>Raja_Sabarish</strong> (Thu, 25 Apr 2019 04:51:48 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran well, after running the below commands
```sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)

sudo systemctl restart docker``` i did `docker-compose down` it stopped all the services. But then after running `sudo ./manage up` it started saying port is already in use
So, to double check it `sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN` and killed all the process.

Now if i try to start bby using `sudo ./manage up`. Its not starting at all. kindly look at below logs

@Raja_Sabarish - the command `sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)` allows you to use docker without the need to use sudo - it puts your user into the docker group.  So if you run that, you should not be using sudo at all.

Hi guys! I applied all settings to add a new node (Node5) on my pool and it's all right. But new node is `Unreachable` now. From logs I'm getting:

<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Fri, 26 Apr 2019 16:53:45 GMT):<br/>
@vsadriano It is curious why it in not showing up in validator-info. Take a look in ledger/sandbox/keys/Node5/bls_keys/bls_pk. Does it match what you got from init_indy_node for the bls key? it should.
Is the path to this file the same as on the other nodes (with a different node name)?
In a VM, another log that I would look in for clues is "sudo journalctl -u indy-node". You might see if there is anything of interest in the docker equivalent.
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Fri, 26 Apr 2019 16:56:25 GMT):<br/>
You might also try using 0.0.0.0 instead of the actual IP address when launching, since that is a difference between node5 and the other nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>vsadriano</strong> (Fri, 26 Apr 2019 17:07:15 GMT):<br/>
@mgbailey `bls_pk` value in file and `BLS Public key` (`init_indy_node` result) are equals. I set up IP 173.17.0.3.X for all nodes and network communication test is ok.
</p>
<p><strong>vsadriano</strong> (Fri, 26 Apr 2019 17:07:50 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Fri, 26 Apr 2019 17:08:55 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>vsadriano</strong> (Fri, 26 Apr 2019 17:13:19 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Mon, 29 Apr 2019 07:29:15 GMT):<br/>
@vsadriano 
BLS key is get from the Pool ledger (` "sudo read_ledger --type pool"`).
It looks like Node5 can not connect to other nodes in the Pool, so it can not catch-up its own transaction from other Nodes (in order to prove it, you can run ` "sudo read_ledger --type pool"` on Node5 and see if Node5's txn (with seqNo=5) is there).
So, Node5 can not get the BLS key for Node5, since it doesn't have a txn about itself in its Pool Ledger.

That means that the original issue is that Node 5 can not connect to other nodes. Maybe a firewall issue?

Hi @esplinr how does the link secret help to identify the prover?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 20 May 2019 16:06:31 GMT):<br/>
The link secret is used by the prover to sign the proof so that it is clear that the various credentials used to compose the proof came from the same wallet.

Hello, in the document "Sovrin Steward Validator Preparation Guide" (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AH618bj4q9U8FS1uyoIgbcvwNzaghBCQ1v44tNpZ2OU), it is said in section 3.5 (Add Node to a Pool) that "a Sovrin Trustee will put your steward public key into the ledger". I'm trying to run a private pool (as @vsadriano said he is trying to do too) and would like to know how this data is added to ledger (like scripts, steps and alike). Can anybody help me?

</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 16:35:55 GMT):<br/>
@vsadriano There are 2 cases for this question:
1) You are the steward of the node and have access to the command line: ```$ sudo validator-info --json```
2) You have a cli client and keys in your wallet for a TRUSTEE, STEWARD, or NETWORK_MONITOR: ```indy> ledger get-validator-info nodes=<node_alias>```
In both cases you will get back json which can be easily parsed.Check for Node_info/Freshness_status (indicates that the node is in consensus), and Pool_info/Unreachable_nodes_count (indicates how many peer validators cannot be connected to), among other things.

@ashcherbakov could you remind me why it is ideal to have more than 12 nodes? I know you explained this to me before but I can't remember the details. I remember that you mentioned performance but I know we saw a difference in 4 node testing pools 
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 14:11:53 GMT):<br/>
The more nodes you have in the pool, the more malicious (faulty) nodes you may have. So, theoretically you may want to have as many nodes as possible. 
However, PBFT (and especially RBFT protocol that we use) is very "chatty", and it becomes non-linearly slower with increasing number of nodes. 
So, currently we don't recommend to have more than 25 nodes and do our tests on a pool with 25 nodes.

The number of nodes on the pool is recommended to be equal to 3f+1 where f is a number of faulty/malicious nodes. 
So, for a pool of 25 nodes we may have 8 faulty/malicious nodes. 

It's recommended to have exactly 3f+1 nodes, because if the number of nodes is 3f+2 or 3f+3, then the number of malicious nodes is still the same, while performance is worse and getting consensus may be harder.
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 16:35:55 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for answering that. I really appreciate you guys taking the time to do so!  Have you found 25 nodes to be optimal for speed or just for testing? 
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 21:17:41 GMT):<br/>
In our testing, 25 nodes seemed to be the sweet spot between security (8 potential faulty nodes) and performance.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 21:18:15 GMT):<br/>
28 nodes would allow 9 faulty nodes, but we saw a drop in performance.

indy-cli is primarily an administrative tool for ledger transactions. There is no capability in it to do credential or proof exchanges. You will need to write agent code in one of the wrapper languages to do zkp

Given a DID and a full dump of all the transactions on a network (let's say MAINNET), how does one construct the full DID Document?

I understand that you use the DID to look up the associated transactions. My understanding is that the NYM transaction will get the public (verification) key and the ATTRIB transactions will get the other DID document properties, which the resolver uses to dynamically compose the DID document.

Here's where I'm stuck. The NYM transaction includes actual public keys--great. However the ATTRIB transaction does not include actual DID Doc data. It only includes hashes. How do I use these hashes to retrieve the actual attributes?

According to developer documentation, there is a value in the ATTRIB transaction called `raw` which is described like so:
`Hash of the raw attribute data. Raw data is represented as JSON, where the key is the attribute name and the value is the attribute value. The ledger only stores a hash of the raw data; the real (unhashed) raw data is stored in a separate attribute store.`

Someone with deeper knowledge should answer, but based on the data on the Sovrin Mainnet, the data is retrievable: https://sovrin-mainnet-browser.vonx.io/browse/domain?page=1&query=&txn_type=100
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 14:29:24 GMT):<br/>
That shows that the data value of the attrib can be retrieved.  My guess is that the data is not stored on the ledger, but is stored on the node, and is available via ledger api calls.

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 18:50:04 GMT):<br/>
Hmm, this is a good question. On the uniresolver site I see the data is available in the "data" field from the method metadata response. I'm not sure if @peacekeeper is putting this information in himself through his own attrib store or this is being done by the IndySDK and actually goes in the transactions.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 18:51:49 GMT):<br/>
It has to be being done by the indy-sdk since we are doing it and we don't have a node.  We're just querying the ledger via the API calls.

Gotcha, it looks like in the GET_ATTRIB request there's a "raw" field. Try putting "endpoint" as the value in the request and it should return the raw data. https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/requests.md#get_attrib

<p><strong>AndrewNikitin</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 10:43:59 GMT):<br/>
well, you can try to create a you own docker network with subnet 127.0.0.1/8 and pass it into pool_start.sh script.

docker network create --subnet="127.0.0.1/8" "my-indy-network"

and

./pool_start.sh 4 "127.0.0.1,127.0.0.1,127.0.0.1,127.0.0.1" 4 2122 "my-indy-network"
</p>
<p><strong>FarhanShafiq</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 10:44:45 GMT):<br/>
okay let me try.
</p>
<p><strong>FarhanShafiq</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 10:48:06 GMT):<br/>
I tried this after removing all docker container and network but still facing same issue.

</p>
<p><strong>AndrewNikitin</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 11:19:21 GMT):<br/>
well, it's not a trivial case. I think, for now, pool_start script can create pool only on 10.0.0. subnet
</p>
<p><strong>FarhanShafiq</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 11:52:01 GMT):<br/>
Yeah i think so too.
</p>
<p><strong>FarhanShafiq</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 11:52:33 GMT):<br/>
What is the other way to create pool network ?
</p>
<p><strong>AndrewNikitin</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 11:53:15 GMT):<br/>
you can run ./pool_start.sh without any parameters.
</p>
<p><strong>FarhanShafiq</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 11:54:20 GMT):<br/>
but it will run on 10.0.0. subnet that will make unable for me to testing on it.
</p>
<p><strong>FarhanShafiq</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 11:56:10 GMT):<br/>
I also tried to run the pool by using that command:

generate_indy_pool_transactions --nodes 4 --clients 5 --nodeNum 1 [--ips '191.177.76.26,22.185.194.102,247.81.153.79,93.125.199.45'] [--network=sandbox]

But it generate more error than this on i.e invalid nodenum and ips.
</p>
<p><strong>AndrewNikitin</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 11:56:16 GMT):<br/>
you can try to change BASE_IP var in pool_start.sh script
</p>
<p><strong>FarhanShafiq</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 11:58:05 GMT):<br/>
but its uses the 10.0.0.x rather than one static i.e 127.0.0.1
</p>
<p><strong>AndrewNikitin</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 11:58:40 GMT):<br/>
Did you use generate_indy_pool_transactions brackets (like [ ) for input parameters?
</p>
<p><strong>FarhanShafiq</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 12:00:17 GMT):<br/>
I removed that but still facing error.
</p>
<p><strong>FarhanShafiq</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 12:01:08 GMT):<br/>
Also indy-node through apt-get doesn't support linux mint which force me to use docker container.
</p>
<p><strong>FarhanShafiq</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 12:41:46 GMT):<br/>
I tried again with generate_indy_pool_transactions  and now it's working fine or  i suppose that.

I'm running on docker container and each node expose two ips, one for node and second for client. when i try to ping it through browser, it doesn't work. 

Is there anyway to access node API

My workflow is next:
1) create 4 init nodes, generate genesises - OK
2) start pool - OK, init nodes connects to each other 
3) connect to this pool - OK
4) create NYM request, signed and submit it - OK
5) create NODE request, signed and submit it - OK, services: ['VALIDATOR']
6) start new node - failed, node can't connect to network and try to reconnect every min

one question, should the number of node be an odd number, or is it ok if it's an even number (regarding performance and how the bft consensus algorithm work)
</p>
<p><strong>sergey.khoroshavin</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 21:48:44 GMT):<br/>
@BreizhIndy for best results number of nodes should look like 3f+1, where f is number of faulty nodes that network can tolerate. So, you'd better aim for 4, 7, 10, 13, etc nodes. Of course you can have for example 5 nodes in your network, however this is a bit counterproductive since it will be able to tolerate only one failure, just like 4-nodes network, but you will pay the price (in terms of performance) of 5 nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>BreizhIndy</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 22:42:08 GMT):<br/>
@sergey.khoroshavin thanks I was about to do experiment on 4 8 12 16 node but I remembered that there was something like that in my distributed system class ;)

hi  ! i'm trying to set up an indy node by myself following this guide https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/start-nodes.md#scripts-for-initialization
I'm stuck to understand some process. If i use generate_indy_pool_transactions everything goes fine but the initial seed is always the same and i don't want this. If i use init_indy_node i cannot see the files pool_transaction_genesis, domain_transaction_genesis. What part am i missing? Thanks

<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 21:40:22 GMT):<br/>
Hi rtrive,  Here is another option to avoid making genesis files by hand (which is also possible)
You can use the following instructions and the genesis_from_files.py script along with init_indy_node to have unique seeds as you are wanting.  Here is the link: https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/steward-tools/tree/master/create_genesis

I'm trying to initialize and start indy node as presented (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/start-nodes.md#scripts-for-initialization) But i encounter problems running the below commands.  (init_indy_node Alpha 0.0.0.0 9701 0.0.0.0 9702 [--seed 111111111111111111111111111Alpha])  Error:  bad pattern: [--seed

It looks like the [] in that example indicate an optional parameter.  From my experience with the script, you just need to pass the seed at the end of the script (no suqare brackets, and no --seed) for example, I think this is what you want: ```init_indy_node Alpha 0.0.0.0 9701 0.0.0.0 9702 111111111111111111111111111Alpha```

I am noticing that the last few nodes added to the Sovrin BuilderNet are having a hard time getting into and staying in consensus. They are currently out of consensus and restarting them does not bring them back in.  Does anyone know of any code changes in the last twoish releases that might have caused this issue? I am on indy-node 1.9.1. Yes, it could be that it is just by chance that the recently added ones are the ones with issues, but it seems a pretty strong correlation to me, so I thought I would ask.

hi,  I am new to indy and I don't know if this question sounds reasonable. I am trying to build indy node of version 1.7. I noticed that the according crypto version is 0.5.0, but I couldn't find the source of indy-crypto of version 0.5.0 from git. Could anyone help me with it? really much appreciate it. 
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 07:23:54 GMT):<br/>
Please note that the current indy-node version is 1.9.1.
And it depends on indy-crypto 0.4.5: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/setup.py#L56, https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/ci/ubuntu.dockerfile#L12

Hello all,

I am trying to run the indy-dev demo (https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/indy-dev.git) by separating the node pool in one VM and the dev client in one VM. The pool is accessible from the dev client as tested via telnet. However on running the getting_started.py demo code on the client, after putting the correct IPs for the client and pool in utils.py, I get errors 306 and 307. Any thoughts, whether this is the correct way of doing things?

In Monday's Indy Contributors call, we had a discussion about our concerns for the future of Indy based on the small number of contributors to Plenum.
As a result, we have a proposal to the TSC as part of our quarterly report (due today): let's spin Plenum out as its own first-class Hyperledger project.
You can read the rationale here:

what are "identity primitives" in this sentence from the quarterly reports? Trying to understand what is left in Indy if there is no Plenum
```If Plenum leaves Indy, then Indy is a smaller and more focused project. Indy will consist of the identity primitives and server configuration for Plenum. It will be easier to understand and contribute to.```

Might that mean eventually having a rust (?) library for communicating with a plenum/indy ledger, separate from indy-sdk?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 20:37:05 GMT):<br/>
Interesting question.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 20:38:11 GMT):<br/>
We are already keen to move most of the Indy SDK to Aries as separate Aries components (Indy Wallet crate move to Aries-KMS, each wrapper to its own Aries language library, Indy Pack / Unpack to Aries something else).
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 20:39:00 GMT):<br/>
I expect after that, what is left in the Indy SDK is the Indy Verifiable Data Interface for Aries (indy-vdri-aries) a.k.a. the Indy resolver for Aries.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 20:40:27 GMT):<br/>
If we separate Plenum from Indy, Plenum won't have any of the identity primitives. So I don't think there would be an Aries / Plenum resolver. But there probably would be a Plenum Rust library that would be leveraged by the Indy Aries VDRI.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 20:40:36 GMT):<br/>
That's my thinking, spur-of-the-moment.

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 22:36:23 GMT):<br/>
Is there documentation somewhere of how transaction signatures work in plenum? I'm not sure but I think they are created over the submitted JSON representation of a transaction before it is converted to msgpack for storage, and eventually back to JSON when queried by a client. Is there any way for a client to verify one? I suppose this would also mean fetching a NYM's verkey as of a particular sequence number in case it's changed since then.
</p>

Hi there, I've tried to built a sample application with Sovrin and Hyperledger. I'm using the indy-pool docker file from the indy-sdk and deployed the docker pool on a public server. The port 9701 - 9708 are free and available. If I want to connect to the pool, my client will try to connect to the pool but somehow runs in a pool-timeout. I captured the traffic and see a lot of TCP-Retransmissions and TCP-RST coming from the indy pool.

Does anyone know what it could be?

hi guys! I would like to ask a question: 
could be a security problem if a potential hacker could stolen the steward's wallet and for example could open it and have access to the network? 
Is it good to protect the steward's wallets on a secure place o this is not at all a problem? Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>donqui</strong> (Fri, 08 Nov 2019 09:16:14 GMT):<br/>
Wallet was designed so that if it was stolen it won't be of much use as data at rest is encrypted, the only thing attacker could to is to try to break the encryption. What you need to keep secure is the wallet key used to 'unlock' the wallet.
</p>
<p><strong>donqui</strong> (Fri, 08 Nov 2019 09:17:34 GMT):<br/>
but it is always a good idea to limit the attack surface and not let your wallet to be compromised, so I would say try to keep it in a secure place :)
</p>
<p><strong>rtrive</strong> (Fri, 08 Nov 2019 11:35:55 GMT):<br/>
if they will break the encryption and have access to data on wallet, this could be a problem for the blockchain?
</p>
<p><strong>donqui</strong> (Fri, 08 Nov 2019 11:37:28 GMT):<br/>
yes, because they would own your keys and creds and could impersonate you.
</p>
<p><strong>donqui</strong> (Fri, 08 Nov 2019 11:38:33 GMT):<br/>
but if you notice that your wallet has been stolen and that someone is trying to break the encryption, there are ways to revoke your creds and rotate keys

Hi @ashcherbakov @sergey.khoroshavin @kenebert @burdettadam Is there a provision currently to sign any transaction data
using the pairwise did s public keys?

</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 13:47:01 GMT):<br/>
Every transaction (write request) must be signed by a user. The use needs to have a NYM txn with a verkey (public part of of DID's key) on the ledger before sending any transaction. So, the user can sign the transaction by the private part, and the ledger can verify the signature using the public part stored on the ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>ashlinSajan</strong> (Wed, 13 Nov 2019 09:11:09 GMT):<br/>
Is there already some functionality available in Indy for signing?

<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Wed, 13 Nov 2019 10:22:15 GMT):<br/>
yes, please have a look at `sign_request` in indy-sdk

when sharing a crdential, what happens if a party if recording  network traffic, can it re use the data sent to the relying party and use to perform a replay attack?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 18 Nov 2019 15:39:00 GMT):<br/>
are you talking about when presenting a credential to a verifier? If so, each party contributes a nonce as required by the protocol which makes replays invalid. However, the proofs generated can be verified whenever because they are classified as non-interactive ZKPs so it depends on what you are trying to protect from replays
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 18 Nov 2019 15:39:37 GMT):<br/>
Usually there are two cases to protect, 1- malicious holder, 2- malicious verifier

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 18 Nov 2019 15:40:16 GMT):<br/>
a malicious holder's goal is to fool the verifier into believing she has a valid credential when she does not
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 18 Nov 2019 15:41:11 GMT):<br/>
a malicious verifier has two goals, impersonate the original credential holder, and divine the true values used in the ZKP
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 18 Nov 2019 15:42:25 GMT):<br/>
the malicious holder case is extremely difficult because the odds of this happening is 1/2^256 per attribute 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 18 Nov 2019 15:44:49 GMT):<br/>
for a verifier to impersonate the holder, this is enforced by the nonces generated by another verifier. Think of these a presentation ids or session ids. They change per presentation. In that case the malicious verifier serves the same role as a malicious holder. Since she cannot create a new proof valid for the new session id or break the proof presented to her to extract the actual attribute values, replay to impersonate is very difficult

Hi Team, Can anyone please differentiate between Steward and a trust anchor role in Sovrin? As per my understanding, steward is the one who takes responsibility of running a node of Sovrin, and trust anchor issues/verifies credentials. In order to do that, trust anchor will also have to run a node in Sovrin? So indirectly a trust anchor is also a steward ? Can someone please give some inputs on this ?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 07:47:37 GMT):<br/>
> steward is the one who takes responsibility of running a node of Sovrin
Yes

> In order to do that, trust anchor will also have to run a node in Sovrin?
Sovrin/Indy ledger is Public Permissioned. That means that 
1) Anyone can read from the leger. No special roles are required. *No need to run a node to do reads*
2) Writes to the ledger are permissioned. But they are restircted just by the role only (like some txns can be written by Strewards only, some by Trust Anchors only). And again, *No need to run a node to do writes*. 

> trust anchor issues/verifies credentials.  
Issuance of credentials requires writing some transactions to the ledger (SCHEMA, CRED_DEF, Revocation). And usually only Trust Anchors (or it's better to use a new term Endorsers) can do this. 
Verifiaing of proofs doesn't require any writes to the ledger, only reads. So, anyone can be a verifier.

<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 11:08:04 GMT):<br/>
Hi @JeromeK 
I don't think this is related to server performance since read operation is pretty cheap. 
Also we're not aware of any issues related to this.

Do I understand correctly that everything works with a custom python script but doesn't work with CLI?

</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 11:47:50 GMT):<br/>
yes, (currently): So we tried to do the same interactions yesterday and today. 
Yesterday: none of them worked
Today: The python-script worked, CLI still getting a timeout
</p>

<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 11:48:38 GMT):<br/>
(no modification to the calls)
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 11:54:27 GMT):<br/>
Is the problem with the specific CredDef txn only? Or you see the same timeout issue with other txns (with not so many attributtes)?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 11:54:38 GMT):<br/>
Also what version of CLI are you using?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 11:55:57 GMT):<br/>
Please note, that there is a limit for maximum length of a message on Node side (128 KB). So, in theory, if the message is huge, it can be just rejected. 
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 12:08:44 GMT):<br/>
Ahhh thats the Problem....
Because all of those Attributes are crazy long, it comes over this maximum lenght
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 12:08:52 GMT):<br/>
thanks thats what i wanted
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 12:10:07 GMT):<br/>
or wait no ? because then i would not get a response back from the python-script

<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 12:11:02 GMT):<br/>
* i only see the timeout if we have X amount of Attributes with in one schema 
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 12:11:40 GMT):<br/>
i dont now the exact number when this appears but we noticed this at 88 attributes
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 12:13:33 GMT):<br/>
Also a question
should i get a timeout if its to big
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 12:13:34 GMT):<br/>
It can be that the payload is near the limit and sometimes it exceeds it, sometimes not...
But agree that this is still weird.
If txns with less number of attributes work fine, then this is likely that the problem is related to the size of messages
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 12:13:37 GMT):<br/>
or a 200 - rejected?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 12:14:11 GMT):<br/>
Timeout. A Node will not send huge reply at all
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 12:14:28 GMT):<br/>
okay thanks for the infos, I will have a deeper look at it

<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 12:45:50 GMT):<br/>
Okay even more strange, the response is only 240 bytes big
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 12:45:58 GMT):<br/>
so not even close to 128 kb
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 12:47:10 GMT):<br/>
Is it the full response, or only the "paylaod" part? Any response consists of "payload" and "metdata" (state proofs, etc.)

yeah... I think the limit for the number of attributes in Schema has been tested against write requests only. Not against read requests which can be more because of additional metadata (like state proofs)

Same reason someone runs sqlite, an embedded version of a SQL server, cuz it's lighter weight and fewer dependencies.   Yes, I have run in docker but curious if it was possible to run embedded 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 09 Jan 2020 20:01:24 GMT):<br/>
In theory possible. For example, in our ACA-Py demos, we run an ACA-Py agent as a subprocess of a controller. How much work to configure that, I don't know.  No one has done it.

Yes, it's possible and used in indy-plenum's and indy-node's  integration tests (indy-sdk as well as a pool of N nodes is run in one process there).

Yes, it's possible and used in indy-plenum's and indy-node's  integration tests (pytest). indy-sdk as well as a pool of N nodes is run in one process there.
And this is possible there because nodes are instantiated rught from the code for test purposes. 

For the end users using build artifacts (deb packages, Docker images, etc.) it's not easily possible to run both client and node in one process.

Hi guys, 

I am trying to create a `pool_transactions_genesis` file for my own configured nodes. Is there any way to do this? I am trying to create a network which can be deployed on multiple servers without using the `generate_indy_pool_transactions ` script which is for test networks only.

Please let me know if anyone knows the procedure.

Thanks

Sorry, I think I didn't answer the question that you asked.  Any valid DID/verkey combinations will work in the Genesis files.  The new network you make will assign the roles indicated as it is initiating itself. I usually create DID's using the indy-cli interface `indy-cli> did new seed=` If you want to try out the auth_rules feature, you will want to create at least 3 Trustees so that you don't lock yourself out. (They don't all have to be in the genesis file)

I added some modifications to the request handling in indy-vdr in case somebody with inside knowledge wants to validate/critique the changes:
- Combined the 'single' (state proof) and 'consensus' request handlers
- When not using state proof, initially send to (`read_nodes + f`) instead of all nodes
- Abort requests if `read_nodes` consistent NACK replies are received
- Abort requests if `f` reject/NACK/unrecognized replies are received
- Fixed state proof verification for `GET_TXN` of `ATTRIB` transaction (must hash raw/enc property)
- Fixed comparison of responses for consensus checking (must sort participant names)

Thanks for the improvements. I believe @sergey.minaev or @Artemkaaas can add more comments specific to Indy SDK.
As from my side:
> When not using state proof, initially send to read_nodes + f instead of all nodes
Do I understand correctly that this is for read requests only? 
`initially send` means that if there are no replies by timeout, it will be send to more nodes, doesn't it? 
Please note, that up to F nodes may be down/malicious/unavailable, but we need at least F+1 equal replies in 'consensus' case. So, if a read request is sent to just `read_nodes + f`, and F nodes are not available, it will not be enough for consensus (as `read_nodes ` is usually less than F+1).


</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 08:06:13 GMT):<br/>
> Abort requests if read_nodes consistent NACK replies are received

Up to F nodes can be malicious, so we can not trust anything got from less that F+1 node (unless we use State Proofs and BLS signatures).
As `read_nodes ` is usually less than `F+1`, I think we should not abort a request if we got just `read_nodes` NACKs.

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 16:48:23 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, I'll make some adjustments to that. Yes, 'initially send' means it will send to more nodes if timeouts or failed responses are received. It makes sense that the 'consensus' handler is more aggressive if it's used for write transactions, I wasn't considering that. I might add a flag for read transactions that don't have state proof verification to enable the less aggressive consensus method (not sending to all nodes)

Thank you, Andrew. I has some additions to Alex commen.
- `Combined the 'single' (state proof) and 'consensus' request handlers` - Personally I don't like their mixing. They have similar moments but it still differs in many places.
- `Fixed state proof verification for GET_TXN of ATTRIB transaction (must hash raw/enc property)` - good catch. Could you also send PR to Liibndy with this change?
- `Fixed comparison of responses for consensus checking (must sort participant names)` - when is it `["data"]["multi_signature"]` possiible? As I remember `multi_signature` is always inside `state_proof` and we remove `state_proof` and `stateProofFrom` fields.

Please note, that a write request must be send to all nodes.

> Abort requests if >f reject/NACK/unrecognized replies are received

Do you abort it when we have > F *equal* Rejects/NACKs? Then the result should be the Reject/NACK returned (having equal F+1 means there is a quorum we can trust)

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Wed, 05 Feb 2020 23:55:47 GMT):<br/>
@Artemkaaas `multi_signature` is inside `data` for a GET_TXN, so if state proof verification fails (like it was for attrib transactions) then consensus can also fail and it might request from all nodes. Maybe it should just be removing multi_signature (and other properties?) for comparing the results, I'm not sure
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Wed, 05 Feb 2020 23:57:56 GMT):<br/>
@ashcherbakov The current version uses a 'failure consensus' to track this
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 00:00:39 GMT):<br/>
Btw, I think indy-sdk might avoid 'no consensus' in this case by looping around to the same verifier and getting the same result, which isn't great

Question for Andrew and Nick.  Can we self-assert that we support AIP 1.0?  Are there any caveats we should add?  There is not a test suite to use. AIP references a number of protocols and specific versions of those protocols. What due diligence do we need to do to say "Yeep, we support it" (in a way that Tobias would understand).

@jrallen 
Currently this is expected behaviour that state proofs are not supported for the audit ledger.
From the client point of view there is no error, reply is obtained via consensus fallback (to have enough equal replies). So, the only problem is that libindy logs may look a bit confusing in this case.

I've done some improvements to it and going to push them to Cam's PR, but there are still unresolved problems, mostly with Ursa python wrapper (like it being unable to find libursa.so in standard locations because it is installed into non-standard location by ursa debian package, or for some reason wrapper itself failing to install from pip for python3, thats weird, but I tripple checked it in several different environments).
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 05 Apr 2020 21:52:57 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, @sergey.khoroshavin - much appreciated.  @cam-parra - any thoughts on how to move this ahead?  Do you have the time to do more on it? Can we have someone else work it?  Or do we just keep maintaining indy-crypto?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 05 Apr 2020 22:09:54 GMT):<br/>
@andrew.whitehead - perhaps you can help determine the state of things with this PR?
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Mon, 06 Apr 2020 14:42:32 GMT):<br/>
So the problem is that we don't have a working artifact for URSA and to get one on repo.sovrin.org is a bit difficult since the people who can do it are a bit busy. Besides that we have found a way to use URSA on 16.04.  If andrew wants to find a way to get URSA to work on pypi that would be great

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 06 Apr 2020 14:53:23 GMT):<br/>
I have the ability to publish to PyPi in the hyperledger org, if that helps
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 06 Apr 2020 15:04:30 GMT):<br/>
For the record von-network uses indy-node with ursa (built from source), with a stub wrapper that pretends to be indy-crypto. I don't think I can do anything about debian packaging issues but I can look into the python packaging
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 06 Apr 2020 15:06:08 GMT):<br/>
we're paying for bintray and artifactory, as well. @BrettLogan uses both to publish artifacts for Fabric, and Besu uses them.

I've made required changes to cargo-deb config of libursa and successfully built and uploaded deb artifact to repo.sovrin.org, so as of now the only problem is with ursa python wrapper. It still refuses to install from pypi, but when installed manually it correctly works with updated deb package
</p>
<p><strong>sergey.khoroshavin</strong> (Mon, 06 Apr 2020 19:03:54 GMT):<br/>
Changes to libursa can be found in this PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/pull/108

For the record - I raised an issue in python-ursa wrapper describing problem with installation from PyPi: https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa-python/issues/4
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 18:08:15 GMT):<br/>
The only uploaded package is a wheel for python 2 https://pypi.org/project/python-ursa/#files
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 18:43:54 GMT):<br/>
@sergey.khoroshavin I'd suggest somebody upload a source package for python 3
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 19:08:03 GMT):<br/>
could [this github action](https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa-python/blob/master/.github/workflows/pythonpublish.yml) be changed to make that happen?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 19:19:41 GMT):<br/>
The repo doesn't have any releases so I don't think that's been run
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 19:21:34 GMT):<br/>
should I create one? like a 0.0.1?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 19:22:25 GMT):<br/>
You could try creating a 0.1.0 release, that's the current version
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 19:22:58 GMT):<br/>
`v0.1.0` - correct?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 19:23:21 GMT):<br/>
Yeah that's the convention github recommends
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 19:29:51 GMT):<br/>
When [this is merged](https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa-python/pull/5), I'll try again. @cam-parra 
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 19:31:14 GMT):<br/>
Is that necessary? It should just add the missing packages
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 19:32:16 GMT):<br/>
Confirmed I can install it with pip now
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 19:33:17 GMT):<br/>
I got an error when it tried to publish to PyPi
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 19:33:23 GMT):<br/>
OK, I'll kill it
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 19:34:06 GMT):<br/>
https://pypi.org/project/python-ursa/#files shows the python 3 file.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 19:37:08 GMT):<br/>
It added the wheel but normally there's a source package as well, so that's probably the error
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 19:37:46 GMT):<br/>
the issue was it couldn't upload the python2 version of the wheel because it already existed.

I was also thinking the same that people will misuse this data field, but if you put constrain, you have to take multiple consideration. It's better to define ATTRIB further down into ServiceEndpoints[] and PublicKeys[] because according to W3, these are the information that a DID can put/update their-self.

Hey folks - interested in contributing to Indy Revocation 2? We have posted a couple of Help Wanted issues for tech spikes into our revocation plans. These are for one or two standalone programs (any language!) to test out the ideas we have for revocation - think of them as assignments you would get in a Computer Science class on algorithms and data structures. If you can spare a 1/2 to 1 day to help out, that would probably do it!

Issues are here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/issues, with the ones I'm talking about tagged with "Help Wanted".

Questions welcome, contributions even more so!

When I open the directory with volume mounted: /var/lib/indy/sanbox, it is empty. But when I open the same directory without volume, it has data in it

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Sat, 25 Apr 2020 19:56:19 GMT):<br/>
You might need to create the directory in your dockerfile, before it is mounted
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 25 Apr 2020 20:42:00 GMT):<br/>
Issues like that are usually docker permission issues.  If you don't pre-create the folders and make them rw for others, Docker creates them as the container spins up. If Docker creates them, they are owned by root, and the user inside the container can't access them.

Hello Everyone, I need some help understanding an error I'm seeing on the log for one of the nodes. Essentially one of the nodes is throwing the following error: CURVE I: cannot open client HELLO -- wrong server key? ... has anyone seen this before? Unfortunately i lost the ability to get the logs from the other nodes.

Hi guys, I did a fresh install on ubuntu 16.04, my setup right now is 4 machines, each running one node. I did the following steps : 
1. Install using deb packages.
2. Change NETWORK_NAME on all machines from /etc/indy/indy_config.py
3. RUN generate_indy_pool_transactions --nodes 4 --clients 5 --nodeNum 1 --ips 'ip1,ip2,ip3,ip4' --network=mynetwork
4. Start node on all machines
5 . Run Validator-info.

Output:
```

Its hard to tell for sure without seeing the log file (/var/log/indy/<NETWORK_NAME>/Node1.log) but it looks like you might be missing a domain_transactions_genesis file.  When building a multi server pool, you can use the following to create the genesis files and then copy them into the /var/lib/indy/<NETWORK_NAME> directory (you might need to create the dir) with ownership as indy:indy.  https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/steward-tools/tree/master/create_genesis

```
docker build -f indy-pool.dockerfile -t indy_pool .

Hi folks, I try to get an Indy node as part of a bigger consortium run on OpenShift. However, I could start the Indy node, and as far as I can say it seems to work properly. However, I'm not able to run the helper scripts, e.g. validator-info, because of some ownership issues. I created the indy group and user but the script fails with the following error:
```$ validator-info
Cannot set owner of /var/log/indy/validator-info.log file to indy
The owner of /var/log/indy/validator-info.log must be indy:indy
$ ls -l /var/log/indy/validator-info.log
-rw-r--r--. 1 indy indy 0 Jul 29 14:27 /var/log/indy/validator-info.log```

I'm using this repo: `deb [arch=amd64] https://repo.sovrin.org/deb xenial stable`

I'd appreciate any help.

Thanks

The way the two (OpenShift and Indy-Node) are designed to handle addressing is incompatable.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 15:19:37 GMT):<br/>
As far as the permissions go you need to ensure they are setup so things are able to run under the control of a non-previlaged user in OpenShift.  Examples of what we do; https://github.com/PSPC-SPAC-buyandsell/von-image/blob/master/node-1.9/Dockerfile.ubuntu#L247
Although we're setting things up in different directories, so you'll have to adjust things for the more standard installation latyout.
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 15:32:54 GMT):<br/>
@WadeBarnes, our setup goes as follows. 1 Pod with 1 container running indy node & pvc to store data persistently. 1 Service which references the pod. 2 routes with target ports 9701 and 9702. As routes are provided only as DNS in OpenShift we use an ISGW with plain layer 4 nat (reverse proxy). Thus, we get a static IP:PORT addressing.

Thanks for providing the link to your docker file. I'll try and adapt the permission section and will come back with feedback tomorrow.
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 15:35:23 GMT):<br/>
That's how I tried to fix the permission issues:
```# Fix permission for OpenShift
RUN chgrp -R 0 /var/lib/indy/ \
 && chmod -R g=u /var/lib/indy/ \
 && chgrp -R 0 /var/log/indy/ \
 && chmod -R g=u /var/log/indy/ \
 && chgrp -R 0 /etc/indy/ \
 && chmod -R g=u /etc/indy/ \
 && chgrp -R 0 /etc/passwd \
 && chmod -R g=u /etc/passwd \
 && chgrp -R 0 /etc/group \
 && chmod -R g=u /etc/group ```
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 15:35:49 GMT):<br/>
And in the running container I executed 
```echo "indy:x:$(id -u):$(id -g):,,,:$HOME:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd
echo "indy:x:$(id -G | cut -d' ' -f 2)" >> /etc/group```
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 15:38:02 GMT):<br/>
The indy-node processes want to run as the `indy` user so you need to do this; https://github.com/PSPC-SPAC-buyandsell/von-image/blob/master/node-1.9/Dockerfile.ubuntu#L250
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 15:39:34 GMT):<br/>
Then update ownership and make some things read/write; https://github.com/PSPC-SPAC-buyandsell/von-image/blob/master/node-1.9/Dockerfile.ubuntu#L265
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 15:45:54 GMT):<br/>
How are you dealing with IP:PORT? Instead of using two routes you could also use one egress loading balacer.

We don't host any ledgers/nodes in OpenShift do to the complications.  The ledger instances are meant to be made up of muliple nodes running as a network.

We don't host any ledgers/nodes in OpenShift do to the complications.  The ledger instances are meant to be made up of multiple nodes running as a network.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 15:53:54 GMT):<br/>
We host all of our client services in OpenShift.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 15:56:46 GMT):<br/>
It's far easier to run a provisional ledger in AWS or Digital Ocean for testing, and then use one of the Sorin ledgers when things need to interoperate with a larger set of agents, and then use Sovrin MainNet for production applications.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 15:59:20 GMT):<br/>
We host a few provisional ledgers which are instances of `von-network` running in Digital Ocean.
http://dev.bcovrin.vonx.io/
http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io/
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 16:05:21 GMT):<br/>
So true... We also run one provisional ledger in DigitalOcean. It works like charm. However, due to IT-security guidelines, we're somehow forced to host the indy node in OpenShift. For many use cases, the Sovrin MainNet is a great fit. Nonetheless, in the consortium, I contribute to, we want to an SSI network for Germany/Europe
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 16:06:58 GMT):<br/>
I don't see OpenShift being a good fit for a hosting platform for a fully functional indy-node network (ledger).
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 16:07:49 GMT):<br/>
The static vs dynamic IP assignment simple complicates things too much.
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 16:08:38 GMT):<br/>
It will be just us and maybe a few more participants of the consortium hosting their nodes in OpenShift. Most of them use aws, azure etc., and on premise
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 16:10:58 GMT):<br/>
I agree with you. The static ip:port stuff requires a lot of overhead...
Do you know, why Indy doesn't support DNS in the hell of changing IP addresses due to cloud computing?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 16:11:00 GMT):<br/>
If you are only hosting a single node in OpenShift that is connecting to a larger network, as you say, it's doable, but it adds so many additional layers.
</p>
<p><strong>RobinKlemens</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 16:12:05 GMT):<br/>
jup... At the moment it's the only way for me to participate in the network... Hopefully, things gonna change in the future

Hi, could someone point me some documents that explain what strategy is used by hyperledger to help with efficient metadata search in the blockchain?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 06 Aug 2020 17:34:12 GMT):<br/>
As an identity focused ledger, there isn't a lot of use cases for metadata search on Indy Node. We have an index where we store keys for specific use cases (searching for a specific transaction author agreement), but I'm not aware of anything else.

I'm trying to add a new machine to my pool as shown in https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/node/en/latest/add-node.html

But when I start the new node with sudo systemctl start indy-node
the status shows it fails after a few seconds.

The other nodes are still on version 1.12.3 the newnode 1.12.4, is there a conflict there ?

Also does the ports need to be different in everynode ? I reuse use the same ones as other node, but they are running on different machinces.
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Mon, 31 Aug 2020 19:02:49 GMT):<br/>
The versions should be the same for all nodes.  I am not sure that is your problem though as I think those 2 versions might be compatible...
The ports can be the same on every node.
Send more logs or info?

Hi experts
Does anyone know the steps to our own indy pool and create nodes? I am having hard time to find steps
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 15:00:52 GMT):<br/>
The steps differ depending no the intended purpose.  What is your intended use of the node pool?
</p>
<p><strong>akshay.sood</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 15:01:33 GMT):<br/>
It is for using nodes and stewards with different seeds
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 15:04:41 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure I fully understand what that means.  From a high level what is it that you are trying to accomplish (do)?  Please provide details.
</p>
<p><strong>akshay.sood</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 15:06:00 GMT):<br/>
When we generate indy pool transaction, it creates the configuration with predefined seed which can be used by anyone and connect to the network. I want to define my own seeds not the test network
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 15:08:07 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 15:25:03 GMT):<br/>
If you're looking for the most interoperability at the point, you'll want to look at the Sovrin ledgers.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 28 Sep 2020 15:27:05 GMT):<br/>
They are secure, full distributed, and fully HA.  Each node on each of the networks is hosted and maintained by a dedicated Steward (a company or organization with formal agreements with the Sovrin Foundation).  A list of Stewards can be found on the [Sovrin](https://sovrin.org/) website.
- For dev environments there is [BuilderNet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/stable/sovrin/pool_transactions_builder_genesis)
- For test/staging environments there is [StagingNet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/stable/sovrin/pool_transactions_sandbox_genesis)
- For production environments there is [MainNet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/stable/sovrin/pool_transactions_live_genesis)

You can register DIDs on BuilderNet and StagingNet here; https://selfserve.sovrin.org/

Hello all, I have a questions about changing / rotating keys for Indy nodes.

Background shortly: We are running out own Indy pool, where we have currently four nodes. This indy pool and nodes were set-up initially with the sandbox test keys using the "generate_indy_pool_transactions" command. 
Question: I did some googling and I could not found anything about rotating the node keys so that nodes would not have to restarted, genesis file to be manually updated and deliver the updated genesis file to clients. So it looks like this has to be manually using the "init_indy_keys" command. I used this command and got different keys as an output. In the pool_transactions_genesis file I need to then update the information for each node what comes to the following fields:
"blskey"
"blskey_pop"
"dest"

So far I know what keys map into these fields, but what about the "metadata":{"from": field in the pool_transactions_genesis? Should that be changed and where can I find the hash for that? And similarly, what about "txnId" field in the genesis file?

Let's say I updated Node4 keys using the "init_indy_keys" and I succesfully updated the pool_transaction_genesis file. Should I also update Node4 keys in all other node's /keys folder?

Is it really so that this is basically the only way to rotate keys? Any improvements on the roadmap for this?

Thanks in advance!

Hi all,
I am trying to create a customized indy network where I have to specify the number of validator nodes and their Ip-addresses in order to deploy them.
I am trying to upgrade the von-network project in order to do this.
I am wondering if this will be the best apporach or I have to create it directly based on indy-node.
Otherwise, I wanted also to check if there are some tutorials that may help to understand the different steps to add a node to the von_netowrk (ie: add  node5_1)
Thanks in advance

I am working on writing a GDPR compliant governance framework.  A feature called "Tombstoning" has been proposed in the past that helps with part of that, but has not yet been completed.  Does anyone know the status of the "Tombstone" feature? 
In the meantime, it would be nice to be able to document or incorporate a proposed "manual" method to do "Tombstoning" until the feature is available. Is that possible?  If so, how? Perhaps a whitepaper or document is already written? @sergey.khoroshavin? @Toktar? or @esplinr?

<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 23:33:10 GMT):<br/>
Thx Richard, now all we need is a workaround to use while it gets implemented...  Is there one?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 23:46:04 GMT):<br/>
Individual stewards could do a variety of things to block access to specific requests. That will force requestors to try a different validator in the pool. I am uncomfortable with the idea that stewards can refuse to respond to some requests, and I would advocate that the governance framework of an Indy ledger forbids that.
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 15:55:39 GMT):<br/>
How does a Steward comply with GDPR or other local laws if the framework forbids it?  Even the sovrin Framework has a clause in it (referring to the unwritten tombstone feature) so that it can be GDPR compliant.  I don't see how any framework can "forbid" it, based on the fact that a "mistake" could easily be made on a ledger which might put it in violation.  Please explain?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Sat, 10 Oct 2020 00:27:46 GMT):<br/>
The governance framework should forbid individual stewards tampering with data or selectively responding to requests, which would be required to do something like tombstoning without recording that tombstone on the ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Sat, 10 Oct 2020 00:27:57 GMT):<br/>
The advantage to an actual tombstone is that there is a record and governance around it.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Sat, 10 Oct 2020 00:28:23 GMT):<br/>
My concern is with attempts to "workaround it".
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Sat, 10 Oct 2020 00:29:02 GMT):<br/>
Also, even though people regularly ask about tombstones, and say it is important, no one to my knowledge cares enough to implement it.

Hi, can someone help me map the Indy Node roles to real life entities? Who would perform the trustee, steward, endorser and monitor?
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Mon, 26 Oct 2020 15:06:10 GMT):<br/>
Trustee- A person who is either a member of the Board of Trustees (the way Sovrin Foundation does it)  or another volunteer from a relevant organization interested in making sure the network was well managed.
Steward - an organization willing to donate and operate a node. The organization typically pays employees to monitor and manage their node using their organizations Steward DID.
Endorser - An organization willing to take on the legal obligation and effort required to assist Transaction Authors to write items to a ledger. They may also write their own txns and this is the reason that some of them want to become an endorser. The organization will assign employees or contractors to act in their behalf with their Endorser DID.
Network Monitor - An personwho has been assigned to make sure that a node or the whole network continues operating efficiently.  They get access to more information than is generally  available to the public users.
Summary - some roles are generally considered "organization" roles and others are considered to be owned by an individual as shown above.

Hi all, I've recently restarted working on a project. I am running my nodes in a docker container on a server but I have found that I cannot communicate with the ledger from the CLI or the SDK, resulting in a timeout error as no response received. I am confident the genesis file is correct as I copied it from the container and through the SDK I can at least open the pool ledger but cannot sign and submit nym requests. Thank you!

Looks like the `indy_plenum_ver` needs to be updated to a version that matches the dependency updates @askolesov made.

Thanks Wade.  Two questions then:
1) I thought the indy-pool.dockerfile was bound to a release that would not change. 
2) I listed the versions of the indy-plenum package but am not sure what it should be changed to.  Just the latest version, which is currently `1.13.0~dev1021` or the latest 1.12.1 version which is `1.12.1~dev993` or another?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 01 Dec 2020 16:13:22 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure of the exact details.  @sergey.minaev, @sergey.minaev, @Toktar, are any of you able to way in?

@sergey.minaev @Toktar I've tried with various versions of indy-plenum and still get the same error.  To reproduce, simply execute `docker build --no-cache https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/raw/v1.15.0/ci/indy-pool.dockerfile`

Thanks.  This was answered on the indy-sdk channel.  The fix is to pin those 3 packages to the version in parens as follows: `RUN apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y \
python3-pyzmq=${python3_pyzmq_ver} \
indy-plenum=${indy_plenum_ver} \

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 20:01:13 GMT):<br/>
Folks -- we met today on the "Ubuntu 20.04" problem.  Based on the information provided from @cam-parra we have redefined the immediate problem to be the "Ubuntu 18.04" which we think (but have to test/verify) is already solved.  So we would like to get the existing PRs for Plenum and Node for 18.04, tested and merged so that we can include them in the current release.

Next step on the is for @WadeBarnes to work with @Toktar and team to get the CI/CD run completed for the relevant PRs.  Ideally, the resulting artifacts will support both 16.04 and 18.04.  We need to see how to both verify that and how to publish the artifacts for those.  Anyone that can help with that are encouraged to.

We would REALLY like to  get this wrapped up as soon as possible.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 20:01:43 GMT):<br/>
Ubuntu 20.04 support can follow on after we release an 18.04 version.

Hello all, i'm running a test Indy pool network (4 nodes), are there any command lines that i can use to connect to my indy network and check indy network details (e.g. what are role types of indy nodes, Trustee, Stardward etc)?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 15:05:37 GMT):<br/>
Your environment already has a super-powered Trustee that you can use to create more DIDs - endorsers and plain authors.  This tutorial spins up a network and some agents (you ignore their purpose for what you are doing) and then walks through using the CLI to so some things.

@swcurran , thanks for the reply. I've figured out Indy-SDK cli is the command line i can use, but can't find any relevant commands that can show me node role type info. I would also like to know how i can configure a node to be either Trustee or other types? is this something i need to configure before having an Indy network up and running or after?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 18:18:56 GMT):<br/>
You have to connect to the network first (`pool connect <ledger>`, and then the command `ledger get-nym did=VsKV7grR1BUE29mG2Fm2kX`
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 18:19:16 GMT):<br/>
That will tell you the role of DID.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 18:19:39 GMT):<br/>
Configuring nodes, adding nodes and so on is a lot more complicated.

Hi @Yunxi 3 I don't know of a "tell me all of the Steward DIDs on the network" command, but you can look in the /var/lib/indy/sandbox/domain_transaction_genesis file on any node to see the initial DIDs for the Trustees and Stewards in your test network. (where "sandbox" is your test network name).  
A Node does not take on a role like Trustee or Steward.  Those roles are assigned to DIDs on the ledger and can be changed by using a DID with the TRUSTEE role.  Adding new DID's with the mentioned roles usually happens after your network is up and running for test networks.  The best way to begin is to find the seed used for a TRUSTEE that is already on your network, add that TRUSTEE did to your wallet (using the >did new seed  command), then use that TRUSTEE did (>did use <did>) to get started. Then you can start playing around with adding DIDs with various roles and checking things out on your network.  For more ledger commands that you can run, try >ledger help in the indy-cli.

<p><strong>Yunxi 3</strong> (Mon, 25 Jan 2021 10:13:21 GMT):<br/>
@lynn.bendixsen, as per your explanation, are roles such as TRUSTEE or Steward applied to agents instead of a node?

@lynn.bendixsen, the above image i've found shows an Indy node can be either a Validator (write/read permission) and an Observer (read permission only), but i can't find any information in Indy guide that shows how i can set up a network with these two types of nodes. Also wondering if they are relevant to concepts such as TRUSTEE and Steward?

@lynn.bendixsen, also a very basic question. If I need to set up a production-level Indy network for an enterprise-level project, which docs show the right tutorial for setting up an Indy network?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-node?msg=XGGYhyBbfk3pGmWKw) Roles such as Trustee, Steward and Endorser are permissioned roles on an Indy Network ledger.  Agents might use DIDs that have one of those roles as part of dealing with the network, but do not themselves use those roles.
 The observer Node concept was discussed and designed, but never implemented.  As such, there are no Indy Networks with an Observer Node on them, nor can there be until the implementation has been done.  There are no current projects that I know of that are working on implementing observer nodes.  The different types of nodes are not at all related to the DiD roles existing on the ledger.
Here is a link to my starter document that I use to set up production level networks. It includes links to several other documents: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tg4dAEtC78TxG9AsIby_CfpbeOicK_YMKznSQOvtIVU

@lynn.bendixsen , thanks for sharing the doc link, i'll definitely look at it. Just making sure i understand you correctly. Q1. Regarding the Indy node, as per what you explained, my understanding is current indy nodes have only one type that can read and write data from/to indy ledger, right? Q2. following on Q1, this means if an Indy node wants to determine whether data sent from agents can be written to the indy ledger or not, that's the time we should use permissioned roles such as Trustee and Steward related to DIDs representing end users , right?
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 23:17:05 GMT):<br/>
Q1. correct, all indy nodes are currently validator nodes.  There are no other types.  Q2. Yes, Indy nodes write data to the ledger based on consensus, and to achieve consensus, the nodes must agree that the correct number of signatures from valid users appears on the transaction to write.  Different transactions require different levels of signatures and different numbers of signatures of that level (TRUSTEE, ENDORSER, STEWARD etc.)  To determine how many and what kind of signatures are required for each transaction on a network, execute a get-auth-rules command.

The term "Trust Anchor" has been deprecated and is no longer used on the ledgers.  It has been replaced by "Endorser" and slightly redefined. The Steward role is only used for managing network nodes and is almost entirely unrelated to "Endorser". (Does not have any of the same privileges).

Trustees have other purposes, but with three trustee signatures they can add or remove existing nodes and do other network management and administration things (like upgrades). They are also responsible for adding/removing DID's of all roles. Only Stewards can add a new node and only one node for each Steward on a network.

Hello @lynn.bendixsen , i want to use an example to make sure i understand the limitation of Stewards for adding new nodes. so, if we have 3 stewards (S1, S2 and S3)in the Indy network consisting of 4 nodes (N1 - N4). Do you mean if S1 wants to add new nodes, it kind of has a credit with a value of 1 (meaning adding 1 node), it then can add a N5 as a new node to the network, and then its credit of adding a new node becomes 0(no chance to add any other new nodes like N6 etc.), and this principle applies to S2 and S3?
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Wed, 03 Feb 2021 20:53:34 GMT):<br/>
Yes, each Steward DID, can only be used to add 1 node to the network. On test networks, the same node operator might create multiple steward DID's so that they can add more Nodes if needed.  If there are 4 nodes in a network, there must be 4 steward DID's used, one for each node.

@paul.bastian and @WadeBarnes , thanks for providing the info and link. I see aries-cloudagent-python should be used to build controllers along with the agent, but i'm still confused with when we should use Indy-SDK? looks like Indy-SDK might have overlapping functions with aries and Indy-Node, is this correct?

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 13:23:54 GMT):<br/>
All of the functionality you need is in aries-cloudagent-python.  The components of indy-sdk are being broken out into new shared libraries which in turn are being integarted into the newer aries frameworks such as aries-cloudagent-python.  If you are starting from the beginning you don't need to use indy-sdk directly.
</p>
<p><strong>Yunxi 3</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 14:10:39 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @WadeBarnes , so my understanding of the mapping between 3 Indy components and their libraries are, (1) agent -> aries-cloudagent-python  (2) cryptography  -> ursa and (3) Indy DLT network setup ->  Indy-node, is this correct?

Hello all, when I go through this doc: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/docs/getting-started/indy-walkthrough.md for how a Steward can onboard a new party, the message shown in the picture says a  communication channel between each pair exists. I would imagine this agent level communication between a Steward and the new party. At this point, i understand the new party's DID is not committed to the ledger yet. Then when i see this link: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0067-didcomm-diddoc-conventions/README.md. explaining how agent-level channel should be established, step 1 shows: sender resolves the did-communication service of the recipients. I'm wondering in the onboarding process, how can the new party resolve the DID of the Steward without completing the onboarding process?

I think you could abstract you're thinking to:
1) Agent; one of the Aries Frameworks.
2) Ledger; Indy-Node.

The cryptography bit is abstracted and handled completely by the Agent.  You're application's business logic interacts with the agent an does not need to be concerned with the underlying cryptography.

@swcurran, @andrew.whitehead may have more to add.
</p>
<p><strong>Yunxi 3</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 17:10:48 GMT):<br/>
@WadeBarnes , you mentioned "one of the Aries Frameworks" in your answer, could I ask what other frameworks are available for Agent apart from "aries-cloudagent-python "?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 17:12:44 GMT):<br/>
There is also Aries Framework .NET and Aries Framework Go.  Aries Framework .NET works with Aries Cloud Agent Python; Aries Framework Go uses forward looking protocols, and so does not work with the other frameworks.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 17:12:58 GMT):<br/>
Aries Framework Go does not use Indy.

you don't need a DID on the ledger for didcomm to work, also you could send this information via https/webseite to an endorser. this doc is a little outdated, as an endorser would now write party A's DID to the ledger. also for resolving a DID, you don't need a DID either, its free information on the ledger
</p>

Thanks @paul.bastian, i've gone through the doc for setting up the 1st time communication channel for two agents, now i understand it's not relying on the DLT. One more question i've got is regarding the first-time communication channel between any two Aries agents, is there always a manual intervention that is required? In other words, are there any ways to automate the communication channel setup between any two agents for the 1st time?
</p>
<p><strong>paul.bastian</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:36:36 GMT):<br/>
sure all the things are automateable, usually at least one agent is fully automated in a production setup later. in the textbook ssi the other party is most likely a human that has to interact manully and accept transactions in the wallet as user consent is a major trait of SSI. but fully automated SSI transactions between 2 automated agents are also possible, depending on the scenario, e.g. between two companys or if i give explicit permission for my wallet for certain transactions,e.g. physical access via bluetooth/NFC
</p>
<p><strong>Yunxi 3</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 11:12:27 GMT):<br/>
Hello @paul.bastian , not sure if your answer corresponds to my question. When i looked at this link: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/demo/AriesOpenAPIDemo.md, in the "Establishment a Connection" section, it shows how 1st-time connection is established between two agents. I see a user will have to manually generate an invitation in the Faber agent and then copy and paste this invitation in the Alice agent. I also see this message in the page: "A key observation to make here. The "copy and paste" we are doing here from Faber's agent to Alice's agent is what is called an "out of band" message. Because we don't yet have a DIDComm connection between the two agents, we have to convey the invitation in plaintext (we can't encrypt it - no channel) using some other mechanism than DIDComm. With mobile agents, that's where QR codes often come in. Once we have the invitation in the receivers agent, we can get back to using DIDComm." So I wonder if steps for "out of band message" can't be automated? Hope this clarifies my queestion.

Hi @Yunxi 3 , "Transaction Author" is the external descriptive name given to a DID that  is on the ledger but has no assigned Role. ( i.e. Role= ). Transaction Authors currently require an Endorser signature to be able to write to the ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>Yunxi 3</strong> (Tue, 16 Feb 2021 10:18:01 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the answer @lynn.bendixsen , so basically Transaction Author = DID of a party that has no role assigned. However, in order for a party to write to the ledger, an Endorser role needs to be assigned to the party, is it correct?
</p>

Thanks for the answer @lynn.bendixsen , when you said "Transaction Authors currently require an Endorser signature", does it mean the Transaction Authors' DIDs will have to assigned an Endorsor role?
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Tue, 16 Feb 2021 15:08:26 GMT):<br/>
What I meant was that when a Transaction Author builds a transaction, they assign an endorser at that time, then the transaction Endorserr (a different Entity/DID on the ledger) must sign their transaction for them before they can send it to the ledger.  The Transaction Author just needs the Endorser's signature before they can write their Schema/cred_def etc. to the ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>Yunxi 3</strong> (Tue, 16 Feb 2021 15:58:02 GMT):<br/>
this is clear, thanks @lynn.bendixsen

Hi guys, please let me know if I'm wrong here with my question. I tried to follow the indy-ssivc-tutorial since I'm new to the hyperledger indy stuff. When trying to run the commands for setting up the VON-network with the 4 nodes I always end up getting errors. I tried to solve them by googling and searching for related errors on stackoverflow etc. I ended up on a github page with several issues handling those errors. Those issues where dated with 2020, does that mean that they are still observing the issue there? Or is the tutorial outdated in general? Does someone have alternatives how I can try out those things? Thanks a lot in advance :)

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 26 Feb 2021 16:37:01 GMT):<br/>
If you want to create your own, you can dissect the von-network dockerfile and docker-compose scripts.  They do what you have to do on bare-metal.

Not sure what your goal is in doing that.  It's kind of like saying I want to understand the compiler before I do some coding.  It's great if you want to work on extending Indy, but not needed if you are working on exchanging verifiable credentials.

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Thu, 11 Mar 2021 13:45:05 GMT):<br/>
Looks like there are auth rules preventing the operation.

Dear all, can any one explain what is a seed? I would like to start a server and join a von-network, and I saw one parameter is the LEDGER_SEED. I'm wondering if someone can explain the seed or let me know where to find the description about seed? I didn't find too much information. Thank you! :grin:

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 11 Mar 2021 21:18:10 GMT):<br/>
The seed is a cryptographically random pseudorandom number used to generate a key. For more information see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_seed

Hi @ all, I was wondering if there is some workaround to run node_control for upgrades within OpenShift environment as non-root user. Is it possible to trigger indy-node.service via indy-node-control.service just by adding a user in the unit declaration?

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 12 Mar 2021 13:52:21 GMT):<br/>
Are you trying to run a node, or node pool in OpenShift?  The addressing schemes used by indy-node and OpenShift are incompatible.  It's possible to get a node running in OpenShift but there is a significant amount of effort and extra services and infrastructure required.  Some information here; https://github.com/bcgov/von-network/tree/master/openshift#warning
</p>
<p><strong>weiyaous</strong> (Sat, 13 Mar 2021 20:42:46 GMT):<br/>
Dear all, I have created a pool by following the instruction https://github.com/bcgov/von-network/blob/master/docs/UsingVONNetwork.md. Is there any instruction regarding add more indy-nodes into this pool? Thank you.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Sun, 14 Mar 2021 11:34:32 GMT):<br/>
What is your use case?  Why do you want to add nodes to the `von-network` pool?

`von-network` was originally designed to be an easy to use, fixed size, provisional ledger for test purposes.  It's possible to add nodes, but if you want them managed by the scripts you'll need to make some updates to the start-up scripts and docker-compose file.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-node?msg=ZWEHw3iSHfCu2on4b) Hello, I'm trying to add more nodes to test the consensus and performance. I'm using von-network since I found it's much easier to deploy compares to the original indy project.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Sun, 14 Mar 2021 13:31:13 GMT):<br/>
Consensus and performance of `von-network` or the performance of your application?
How do you plan on using `von-network`?
If you're looking for a production grade ledger you should be looking at using something like Sovrin MainNet.  Sovrin also provides full scale distributed ledgers for `dev` (BuilderNet) and `test` (StagingNet) applications that would be far more suited for full scale performance testing. 
 https://sovrin.org/overview/

You can sign up for BuilderNet or StagingNet here; https://selfserve.sovrin.org/
Ignore the `Payment-Address` field.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-node?msg=MCftx2FSq2Dfqbth3) Thanks, Wade. I actually want to build my own network. I'm starting to learn HL-indy blockchain. Since I have trouble to build network using original Indy project, I start with von-network and found it is much easier to use. I can simply follow the script to deploy a network, so I'm asking whether I can use non-network go further, e.g. adding more nodes.

I came to know of the legal arrangements (Transaction Endoreser-Author agreement) that are currently implemented to take care of these issues but not sure of any technical solution currently implemented.

<p><strong>HighBrow</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 04:41:57 GMT):<br/>
While studying about Indy I was wondering what could be done if an entity wants to get its data removed from the ledger. 

That's not usually possible with blockchains but since Indy works on a public permissioned model, I was wondering if something could be done around "Right to be forgotten" if a community plans to use Indy on scale since the community might be interested in addressing that requirement.
</p>

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 03 May 2021 11:37:11 GMT):<br/>
The transaction needs to be created by the DID of the Steward you just wrote to the ledger.

@WadeBarnes Do you know how long an upgrade transaction should take? I sent it to my ledger and it's been about 30 minutes and it still shows the same indy-node version
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 03 May 2021 18:03:01 GMT):<br/>
It typically takes less then 5 minutes for each node to upgrade.  What was the form of the upgrade transaction you used?
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Mon, 03 May 2021 18:07:37 GMT):<br/>
```ledger pool-upgrade name=indynodeupgrade202105 version=1.12.4 action=start sha256=3405e41a0d175d297ea7b1da7024598809c76c0c746481553c68f696a7840cdc schedule={filled out in actual transaction} timeout=15 force=true package=indy-node```
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Mon, 03 May 2021 18:08:51 GMT):<br/>
I don't use the sovrin package but would that be an issue?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 03 May 2021 18:17:05 GMT):<br/>
Only if the network is running a sovrin based install.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 03 May 2021 18:17:27 GMT):<br/>
Also you should not need `force=true`.
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Mon, 03 May 2021 18:46:44 GMT):<br/>
for some reason it doesn't seem to do anything even though the validator info says it started
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Mon, 03 May 2021 18:54:40 GMT):<br/>
Has anyone been able to do a succesful version upgrade of indy-node without the sovrin package?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 03 May 2021 19:45:27 GMT):<br/>
Does the upgrade show as scheduled on the nodes?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 03 May 2021 19:47:32 GMT):<br/>
`indy-cli`; `ledger get-validator-info` command or `validator-info -v` on the node.  If the upgrade was successfully scheduled.  There will be a section indicating when it's scheduled for.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 03 May 2021 19:47:46 GMT):<br/>
The nodes use UTC, BTW.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 03 May 2021 19:49:10 GMT):<br/>
[hyperledger/indy-node-monitor](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node-monitor) is a great tool for getting node info.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 03 May 2021 19:52:19 GMT):<br/>
The `--status` flag will help highlight things like scheduled or failed upgrades with the help of the analysis plugin;

At ID Union, we are currently working on non-ubuntu16 based containers for indy node. https://github.com/IDunion/indy-node-container 
WIP, we just got the firts (ubuntu 18 and debian buster based) containers running. Any hints to similar efforts/existing work on containerizing indy node and of course contributions are most welcome.

Short answer is; No.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 02 Jun 2021 12:48:33 GMT):<br/>
indy-node does not support DNS resolution of nodes.  This helps ensure registered nodes are "well known" via their distinct IP Address.
</p>
<p><strong>conanoc</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 02:27:59 GMT):<br/>
I see. But, then I could not run  indy-node on kubernetes.
</p>
<p><strong>conanoc</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 07:37:06 GMT):<br/>

No.  Indy Node is currently only running officially on Ubuntu 16.04.  We're in the midst of upgrading to Ubuntu 20.04, but need some help to get that completed.  Most of it is done, but not all...

@sergio.anguita, @RobinKlemens, and @devinleighsmith have been driving a lot of the CI/CD updated from two sides, Robin from the Plenum/Node side and Devin backward from the Sovrin/Token Plugin side.
Next steps are for this CD work (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/pull/1541) to be completed and then integrated with the 20.04 build processes in the https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/tree/ubuntu-20.04-upgrade branch.  The same patterns can then be used and applied to the https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node CI/CD process in the same branches.
Tickets for the Ubuntu 20.04 work can be found here; https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Ubuntu+20.04%22

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 11 Jun 2021 11:36:00 GMT):<br/>
Setting `services=` removes the node from the list of Validators.  Example:

Hello all and @swcurran , I see VON provides services for users to use their dev, staging and von services on this link: https://vonx.io/clickythings/. I've got 2 questions. Q1. Does VON provide the underlying Indy network in the production environment? I can see nodes info for dev env, but can't see nodes info for prod. Q2. To use VON network, does a user need to pay for any transaction fees like how Sovrin does (e.g. it incurs charges for different types of transactions)?

Information on `von-network` can be found here; https://github.com/bcgov/von-network.  There is no cost to any of the `von-network` base ledgers, though we appreciate development contributions to the project, and especially to the underlying Hyperledger Indy-Node and Indy-Plenum projects that power all of the Hyperledger Indy Networks.
`von-network` It is intended to be used as a provisional Hyperledger Indy Node ledger for testing and development only.  We provide a few hosted instances to support the BC Government's `dev` and `test` environments and the community is free to use them.  There is no production level `von-network` instance.  If you are looking for a production level Hyperledger Indy Node network you'll want to have a look at a network like [Sovrin](https://sovrin.org/overview/).  The `Sovrin Main Net` ledger browser you have pictured above is a `von-network` ledge browser connected (read-only) to Sovrin MainNet.

There is no cost to any of the `von-network` based ledgers, though we appreciate development contributions to the project, and especially to the underlying Hyperledger Indy-Node and Indy-Plenum projects that power all of the Hyperledger Indy Networks.
`von-network` is intended to be used as a provisional Hyperledger Indy Node ledger for testing and development only.  We provide a few hosted instances to support the BC Government's `dev` and `test` environments and the community is free to use them.  There is no production level `von-network` instance.  If you are looking for a production level Hyperledger Indy Node network you'll want to have a look at a network like [Sovrin](https://sovrin.org/overview/).  The `Sovrin Main Net` ledger browser you have pictured above is a `von-network` ledger browser connected (read-only) to Sovrin MainNet.  You can register a DID on either Sovrin BuilderNet (`dev`) or Sovrin StagingNet (`test`) for free here; [Sovrin Self Serve](https://selfserve.sovrin.org/).  More information about how to join the Sovrin MainNet (`prod`) ledger can be found here; [Sovrin](https://sovrin.org/overview/)

Thanks for your useful answer @WadeBarnes !!!
</p>
<p><strong>Yunxi 3</strong> (Mon, 14 Jun 2021 17:17:57 GMT):<br/>
@WadeBarnes , do you know when did the first VON network (either dev or test) was setup and launched? how many nodes do they use?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 14 Jun 2021 17:18:45 GMT):<br/>
`von-network` is always made up of a fixed set of 4 nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 14 Jun 2021 17:19:22 GMT):<br/>
We've been running our `dev` and `test` instances for a few years now.
</p>
<p><strong>Yunxi 3</strong> (Mon, 14 Jun 2021 17:19:53 GMT):<br/>
do you know which year they were set up and running ?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 14 Jun 2021 17:20:29 GMT):<br/>
The largest use-case for `von-network` is spinning up a local instance for development.
</p>
<p><strong>Yunxi 3</strong> (Mon, 14 Jun 2021 17:23:34 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @WadeBarnes , i know how to set up a local one, just trying to understand when the dev and test instances were set up that are available in the VON website?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 14 Jun 2021 17:23:43 GMT):<br/>
March 2018 was the first hosted instance we deployed.

Thanks for the testing link! We are currently just spinning up a 4 node test notwork and checking the explorer ( https://github.com/IDunion/indy-node-container/blob/main/.github/workflows/ledger-test.yml -> https://github.com/IDunion/indy-node-container/tree/main/test ) but we will also look into a more complete test setup.

Hi everyone,
I have a question about indy node performance. When we perform a load test with indy java wrapper, the tps values we get are very low (for example, the tps value for nym request is around 50-60)
and when we monitor,we saw that java threads are waiting on submit request step. Does anyone have a similar load test and get different values?
Or if you can get much higher tps values, what would you suggest to check? Not only write request but also read request is giving similar tps results.
We made our test in our private network ( which 4 nodes on same machine different docker containers and machine resources 40 GB ram,30 CPU, 105 GB storage.)

We experience an issue with a huge IC_queue. Our validator_info response has a size of around 7MB. The issue started already in March, when lots of view changes were triggered before the view change could be completed. View_no to be voted for increased from 8044 to 10931. Then a  node voted for a view change to 8045 again which was successful. However every node still carries the huge IC_queue. Restarting does not help since the IC_queue is persisted.

Does anyone know what could be the cause of the initial build up of unsuccessful view changes that still increase the view_no to be voted for ?

I think there should be a mechanism to prevent the IC_queue to grow out of bounds

I am observing that `txnTime` field on transactions tend to be about 30 seconds in the future. Seeing this happening on Sovrin stagingnet net for sure. Seems like a bug. Just open https://indyscan.io/home/SOVRIN_STAGINGNET and wait till new TX comes on the homepage. It will display `Unknown time` as I assume `txnTime` wouldn't be in future.

For a record, it was definitely case with this TX https://indyscan.io/tx/SOVRIN_STAGINGNET/domain/246442
I saw the transaction before even 09:16

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 09 Aug 2021 12:09:54 GMT):<br/>
I think I found the issue.  The time stamp for the current primary node is about 45 seconds in the future.  All others are 1-3 seconds in the past which is what is expected with the indy-node-monitor queries.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 09 Aug 2021 12:10:19 GMT):<br/>
I'm going to bump the node out of the primary position and contact the Steward.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 09 Aug 2021 12:17:42 GMT):<br/>
That looks like it fixed the issue.

Hi all,
I am trying to add a new kind of transaction or modify NYM transactions to include some additional information.
Can anyone point me to the relevant places in the code to do that?
I am trying to understand indy-node and indy-plenum codebases for a couple of weeks. Looks like I need to
add the new type of transaction to plenum and indy-node. Do I need to make changes to the indy-sdk also?

Odd.  THe CLI has autocompletion, so perhaps if you just use `m<tab>` it will autocomplete. I'm wondering if it has a weird character in the name?

Try `wallet open mywallet key`, and it should prompt you for the key like it did when you first created the wallet.

<p><strong>Yunxi 3</strong> (Fri, 08 Oct 2021 15:55:31 GMT):<br/>
think detaching wallet is different from deleting wallet, right?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 08 Oct 2021 15:56:05 GMT):<br/>
No.  You need to open a bash shell like you did and `ls` the wallet directories.

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 08 Oct 2021 15:58:37 GMT):<br/>
Yes, you need to create a unique seed, which will then create a unique DID and VerKey.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 08 Oct 2021 16:00:02 GMT):<br/>
You can create a random (recommended) seed and wallet key using the `./manage` command; https://github.com/bcgov/von-network/blob/master/docs/Indy-CLI.md#generate-a-set-of-secrets
</p>
<p><strong>Yunxi 3</strong> (Fri, 08 Oct 2021 16:01:34 GMT):<br/>
a side question, if two persons (let's say 1st guy is the real holder, 2nd one is a malicious guy) can use the same seed to create the same Verkey, does it mean, they can see the same wallet's contents ?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 08 Oct 2021 16:02:48 GMT):<br/>
Yes!  You need to keep your seed a secret, otherwise someone can impersonate you.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 08 Oct 2021 16:04:22 GMT):<br/>
The DID and Verkey are public and safe to distribute if needed.  The seed and the wallet key are sensitive and should be kept a secret and stored in a very safe place.
</p>
<p><strong>Yunxi 3</strong> (Fri, 08 Oct 2021 16:06:01 GMT):<br/>
okay, that's why we should use the randomly seed generation function to generate our seeds to decrease the likelihoods for attackers to guess our seed, right?

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 08 Oct 2021 16:16:37 GMT):<br/>
You would connect your agent to BuilderNet by providing it with the URL to the genesis file for BuilderNet; https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/stable/sovrin/pool_transactions_builder_genesis

</p>
<p><strong>Yunxi 3</strong> (Fri, 08 Oct 2021 16:23:05 GMT):<br/>
also, by using the buildnet, do i need to use this option --tails-server-base-url for running my ACA-Py ?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 08 Oct 2021 16:23:32 GMT):<br/>
Or set the `ACAPY_GENESIS_URL` environment variable.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 08 Oct 2021 16:23:51 GMT):<br/>
Only if you need to support revocation.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 08 Oct 2021 16:24:21 GMT):<br/>
You should direct `aca-py` questions to the #aries-cloudagent-python channel

Hello all, does Sovrin networks not provide its default tail server?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 15 Oct 2021 18:12:28 GMT):<br/>
No.  That's a concept that we came up with at BC Gov and built.  BC hosts one for convenience, and we maintain a repo for it for others to deploy.

thanks for the response @swcurran. Can i check with you on how *revocation registry size * will impact a credential revocation (e.g. in a production env, what aspects we should take into account regarding the revocation registry)? What is the supported size range for this value? This is a value we have to specify when *creating a new credential definition*.  I've read this article: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0011-cred-revocation#proof-of-non-revocation-intervals, but can't find any answer there.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 22 Oct 2021 12:33:06 GMT):<br/>
You can use this code as reference; https://github.com/bcgov/a2a-trust-over-ip-configurations/blob/master/openshift/manage#L290-L344

`baseURL` is the URL to your `aca-py` instance's admin interface and `apiKey` is the API Key it's expecting.
</p>
<p><strong>Yunxi 3</strong> (Mon, 25 Oct 2021 11:58:44 GMT):<br/>
Hello @WadeBarnes, don't understand how baseURL and apiKey could help here. Could you help clarify it?

</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 25 Oct 2021 14:23:49 GMT):<br/>
You can't skip it.  You have to agree to and accept it.  Once you've done that it won't appear again.  The code above provides a reference on how to accept the aggreement.

@swcurran , any updates on the above question?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 26 Oct 2021 19:06:03 GMT):<br/>
When the revocation registry is created, a the tails file is created based on the size. The tails file has an entry per credential, so the file size grows linearly with the registry size (number of credentials). The size of that file becomes the limiter, as the holder (such as a mobile wallet) must download and process the file. It is a static file, so they only need to download it once, but then they have to hold it locally -- which takes up space.

I don't have the size stats handy, but as I recall, 10k to 20k is about as big as a rev. registry can realistically be.

Hi, I Made some tests yesterday:
Revoc_Reg_Size=3000, Tailsfile 768KB, ProofGen~4sec
Revoc_Reg_Size=10000, Tailsfile 2,6MB, ProofGen~5sec
Revoc_Reg_Size=32768, Tailsfile 8,4MB, ProofGen~7sec
Used: Lissi-Wallet on a iPhone 12Pro
32768 is the max-size-value set in the ACA-Py
</p>
<p><strong>zickau</strong> (Thu, 04 Nov 2021 14:43:16 GMT):<br/>
Is there a conceptual or technical reason for this particular max-size-value?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 05 Nov 2021 14:59:18 GMT):<br/>
I think the size was thought to be the max that the tails file should be, but I'm not sure otherwise.

"ProofGen" time -- that is the time it took the holder to produce the proof, including the proof of non-revocation, right?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 05 Nov 2021 14:59:56 GMT):<br/>
I'm going to do a PR to add this information to the indy-tails-server docs at least (perhaps ACA-Py?). Unless you beat me to it :-)

HI all, 

I’ve recently been working with Hyperledger Aries (versions 0.6.0 & 0.7.1) & have generally found it to be a really amazing framework.

However I notice there seems to be some inconsistencies resulting in errors when executing some of the API calls for the Acapy agents. 

For instance I was able to successfully run a full sequence of schema/credential definition, credential request/issuance & credential verification on a new instance with my Issuer, holder & verifier nodes. 

However, when attempting to run the same sequence again for a brand new set of credentials I get the following error t the send presentation API call:

`Error when constructing revocation state: Error: Invalid structure. Caused by: UrsaCryptoError: Invalid len of bytes representation for PoingG2. CommonInvalidStructure.`


The API Request was constructed using the following details:

Type: `POST`
Endpoint: `http://{{Verifier_IP}}:{{AcaPy_Port}}/present-proof/send-request`
Body: `{
  "comment": "string",
  "connection_id": "{{Verifier_Holder_Conn}}",
  "proof_request": {
    "name": "Proof request",
    "non_revoked": {
      "to": 1636122004
    },
    "nonce": "1234567890",
    "requested_attributes": {
      "additionalProp1": {
        "name": "companyname"
      }
    },
    "requested_predicates": {
      "additionalProp2": {
        "name": "grade",
        "p_type": ">=",
        "p_value": 10,
        "restrictions": [
          {}
        ]
      }
    },
    "version": "1.0"
  },
  "trace": false
}`

Could you kindly advise on why this could be happening especially given that the same request has been successful on previous occasions.

Thanks

P.S. I am running this on the sovrin dev network without a Postgres database

<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 09 Nov 2021 01:47:11 GMT):<br/>
I think this info probably *does* get stored in the wallet, but I don't know how you'd access it.  I suspect the controller has to remember, and if you get an error writing to the ledger then that's a clue that you may need to accept the TAA
</p>
<p><strong>Yunxi 3</strong> (Tue, 09 Nov 2021 16:41:55 GMT):<br/>
@ianco, after testing this without having a controller, I only need to accept the TAA in ACA-Py agent for only once, so guess it might be stored in the wallet. My initial worry was how this interactive mode would work if I dont have the interactive access to the container, but after testing, obviously, ACA-Py is intelligent enough to detect if the ACA-py container is running without an interactive mode supported, the TAA doesn't even pop up, which is good :-)

@WadeBarnes, my ACA-Py agents run in an AWS ECS containers, by default, when running the ACA-Py, it detects there's no interactive mode with this warning message: *Cannot accept TAA without interactive terminal* but it still runs. However, When I tried to create a definition schema, I've got below error: *400: Ledger rejected transaction request: client request invalid: InvalidClientTaaAcceptanceError('Txn Author Agreement acceptance is required for ledger with id 1',).*. This looks like ACA-Py must accept the TAA first. I see AWS ECS provisions an appraoch to allow us to exec into the container, but I'm not sure if this could resolve this issue.

<p><strong>Yunxi 3</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:00:20 GMT):<br/>
is this "authorize" button available in 0.7 only?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:01:07 GMT):<br/>
I'd recommend looking at the reference script I provided.  It will show you how to construct the TAA acceptance payload; https://github.com/bcgov/a2a-trust-over-ip-configurations/blob/master/openshift/manage#L327
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:01:50 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-node?msg=MhoSANm73nvzHg2GX) No, it should be there in 0.6.0 as well.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:02:13 GMT):<br/>
Did you set an API Key for your agent's admin interface?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:02:31 GMT):<br/>
If not it will be wide open and insecure.
</p>
<p><strong>Yunxi 3</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:02:38 GMT):<br/>
no, i'm using admin-insecure-mode for testing purpose
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:03:00 GMT):<br/>
That could be why the authorize button is not there.
</p>
<p><strong>Yunxi 3</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:03:58 GMT):<br/>
ah fair, so without an authorize button, what i need to do is to find out the TAA payload used for Sovrin and call the POST api to accept it, right?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:05:06 GMT):<br/>
Correct

</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:08:33 GMT):<br/>
That URL is an example URL.  It is the URL for one of our OpenShift environments.

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:09:41 GMT):<br/>
It is the base URL for the agent's admin interface.  You will want to use the URL for your agent's admin interface.

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:13:31 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:14:08 GMT):<br/>
The TAA from `/ledger/taa` only forms part of that payload.
</p>
<p><strong>Yunxi 3</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:14:57 GMT):<br/>
how/where can I find out the values for the attributes: mechanism, test and version for Sovrin's builderNet?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:15:00 GMT):<br/>
The acceptance payload needs to define which option, acceptance `mechanism`, you've selected.

thanks a lot, does this "on_file" map to option 2?

<p><strong>Yunxi 3</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:27:21 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>Yunxi 3</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:27:21 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:29:35 GMT):<br/>
In my case `on_file` was option 5.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:30:53 GMT):<br/>
All of the options and version information are contained in the TAA when you `get` it.

ah, i see, they in the "aml" block. I see there are 7 options after calling the GET api, but in the interactive mode, why there are only 4 options?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:35:57 GMT):<br/>
Likely because they are the only options that make sense for the interactive session.

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:43:35 GMT):<br/>
It means there has been paper/electronic agreement signed and it is on file with the user's organization.
</p>
<p><strong>Yunxi 3</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:45:09 GMT):<br/>
Is the difference amongst these options is more on the legal side but not on the technical side (e.g. ACA-Py's behaviour might be different when using different options)?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:46:50 GMT):<br/>
ACA-Py's behaviour will remain the same.  The list of options might change, but the need to select one and say "That's how we accepted the TAA" will be the same.
</p>
<p><strong>Yunxi 3</strong> (Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:49:56 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>zickau</strong> (Thu, 11 Nov 2021 16:19:20 GMT):<br/>
Sorry for my late reply, yes it included the proof-of-non-revoc (but only counted) As far as I understand, the time might be prolonged if you have a very active accumulator were you have a lot of revocations, so the Holder must get a lot of acc information from the ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>zickau</strong> (Thu, 11 Nov 2021 16:19:53 GMT):<br/>
What exactly do you wanna add as PR?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 11 Nov 2021 21:16:46 GMT):<br/>
I agree on the problem with getting the acc information from the ledger -- having deltas is a challenge. 

No worries about the PR -- I can just add in the info to the tails server readme, so it's preserved somewhere. :-)

Hello,

I am setting up an environment for developing indy-node and meeting some problems: `pytest .` outputs errors.
When testing indy-plenum, I got the following output.
```
= 7 failed, 11453 passed, 307 skipped, 71 warnings, 1089 error in 2380.80 seconds =
```
indy-node's test showed a similar result, which included fails and errors. I am using master branch in indy-node and indy-plenum.

I executed commands according to https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/setup-dev.md on ubuntu 16 https://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/ , but the test `pytest . ` did not run.
According to error messages, I additionally executed `pip install --upgrade 'setuptools<45.0.0`, `pip install pip==9.0.3` and so on.
Then, `pytest .` ran but showed errors.

For example I got the following. Actually, plenum/config.py does not include `GENESIS_DIR`
```
E       AttributeError: module 'plenum.config' has no attribute 'GENESIS_DIR'
```
Does this output show an installation problem?

If this question is not suitable here, I would appreciate it if you could tell me where I should write.
Thanks in adnvace.

I'd recommend having a closer look at the way the tests are setup and executed in the  GitHub Actions workflows.  You'll notice they are broken down into groups more.  The tests don't always succeed when run all at once.

By the way, it seems that indy-node's github actions workflow does not do all tests. 
For example, in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/runs/4313751072?check_suite_focus=true , in Sliced Moudule Tests,  Only "1/22", "2/22", ..., and "11/22" are passed to `--test-only-slice` when executing `runner.py`. Then, some test modules such as 'indy_node/test/nym_txn', 'indy_node/test/package', did not appear in any slices. 

Am I misunderstanding?

I also get errors and missing dependencies, when i ran pytest in the root directory. 
Not quite sure if that is intended or not. 
But i remember that the DevSetup mentions to test the subfolers(indy_common/indy_node).

But if i run them locally it seems ok for indy_common.

These variables are basically the variables comming from the GithubActions(GHA) Slice Strategy for jobs. (further reading on that here: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/managing-complex-workflows#using-a-build-matrix)

I couldn't really find any documentation on the fly on the `strategy.job-total` context variable. But it seems to me that it is the total sum of slices and therefore wrong in our case. (2*11 since 2 modules with 11slices)
Will open a PR for that fix.

Hi everyone! I am trying on deploying an instance of Indy Node on my Kubernetes Cluster. I had a look on VON Network at first, but it's almost impossible to make a valid deployment of it to use in production. I'm looking on ways to directly deploy Indy Node, but there is not enough information. I was wondering if someone here has some idea regarding this.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 22 Dec 2021 14:57:16 GMT):<br/>
Did you check out all of the links I provided here? https://github.com/bcgov/von-network/issues/190#issuecomment-995918202
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 22 Dec 2021 14:58:38 GMT):<br/>
The https://github.com/IDunion/indy-node-container repo would be the place to start if your looking to containerize the nodes.

That depends on the use case.

```
32 G RAM
8 CPU cores
1T RAIDed disk space
2 NICs with 2 Public IP addresses (1 per NIC)
```

>In the /etc/indy/indy_config.py file, change the Network Name from “sandbox” (Sovrin StagingNet) to “net3” (Sovrin BuilderNet) using one of the following commands:

Hi @WadeBarnes , I have a question. Why is it specified `net3`? Should I use the same name even when configuring a new network?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 12:36:21 GMT):<br/>
`net3` happens to be the network name decided on for the configuration of nodes connecting to Sovrin BuilderNet.  You can use a name that is appropriate for the network you are configuring and you should keep that name consistent across all nodes connected to that network.

You want to use unique names for the networks.  The name corresponds to the name of the directory that will contain all of the private keys and ledger data associated with the network.  That way if your node ever moves to a different network the data for each network is segregated.
</p>
<p><strong>mateokurti</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 14:10:27 GMT):<br/>
By consistent you mean identical? So for all nodes connected to the Sovrin BuilderNet it should be `net3`? And in my case, we should specify something unique for the network, and configure that name in the same way to each node? Have I understood it correct?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 04 Feb 2022 14:22:03 GMT):<br/>
Correct

Hi again! I'm sorry for the multiple questions I'm having. I'm finding something confusing in the documentation.

```
The Stewards will also need to download the genesis files onto their nodes while completing the setup. All of the following steps are to be completed on the node.
```
and then the genesis files are added to `/var/lib/indy/<network name>`

However, in order to create those genesis files, on `Installation and configuration of Indy-Node` documentation, it is needed to already have those files in that directory. By that tutorial, it instructs to download the genesis files of Sovrin. 

So, my question is, how can I generate Verification Key and BLS, which I need for the genesis file, without having a genesis file to begin with? Not sure if I'm being clear.
</p>
<p><strong>mateokurti</strong> (Sun, 06 Feb 2022 20:13:21 GMT):<br/>
The only way that it can happen, is if the `genesis files` are not needed at the beginning, when the Key for the Validator Node is created.
</p>
<p><strong>mateokurti</strong> (Sun, 06 Feb 2022 20:14:37 GMT):<br/>
But this has contradictions with the statement:
```
Please run the following on the Validator before running init_indy_node.
```

Reference: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/installation-and-configuration.md#323-create-the-key-for-the-validator-node
</p>
<p><strong>mateokurti</strong> (Sun, 06 Feb 2022 20:17:42 GMT):<br/>
So, to sum up. Sorry for the long long question. In the `Installation and configuration of Indy-Node` documentation is says that before running `init_indy_node`, you should have the genesis files in the specified directory.

In the other hand, on `NewNetwork` documentation, it says that you should add the genesis files on that directory, while in order to create those genesis files, the keys from `init_indy_node` are needed.
</p>
<p><strong>mateokurti</strong> (Sun, 06 Feb 2022 20:38:10 GMT):<br/>
_In relation to the previous question_

>NOTE: There are a few steps in the guide that they will not be able to complete because the network has not yet been created, and the guide assumes that you are adding a node to an existing network.

I guess that this is referring to the part, where the genesis files are added to that directory? So, in the scenario when creating a New Network and when we don't have genesis files to begin with, we should run the `init_indy_node` without having the genesis files added to `/var/lib/indy/{network_name}`? Is this correct @WadeBarnes ?

<p><strong>mateokurti</strong> (Mon, 07 Feb 2022 10:31:32 GMT):<br/>
Solved it. There is a confusion in the documentation. So, the right steps would be:

Before `Creating Validator Node keys`, you should `Edit /etc/indy/indy_config.py and change the network name. NETWORK_NAME = "newNetwork"` (if we refer to this quick walkthrough https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/sample/Network/README.md), not the other way around
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 07 Feb 2022 12:52:48 GMT):<br/>
@mateokurti, Can you confirm whether you've resolved the issues you were having?  I looks like you have.  Also can you point out specifically where the confusion is in the documentation so that can be resolved?
</p>
<p><strong>mateokurti</strong> (Mon, 07 Feb 2022 13:24:02 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I did resolve it. I'll write some points in a bit, which I think can be improved

To this question: "how can I generate Verification Key and BLS, which I need for the genesis file, without having a genesis file to begin with?"
A genesis file is not required to be able to generate Verkey and BLS for a node.  When creating a new network, skip all of the steps in the validator prep guide that say anything about the genesis files, as they do not (and cannot) exist for the new network.  The geneesis files will be created during a later step in the new network guide after all nodes have submitted their info to the spreadsheet (i.e.the results of running init_indy_node on each genesis node)
</p>
<p><strong>mateokurti</strong> (Mon, 07 Feb 2022 19:27:00 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I realized that, thank you. However, the step where the Network Name was specified in the node, should not be skipped. If the network name is changed after the verkey and BLS is created, the nodes will be unable to reach each others. This is the part which I mostly found confusing in the docs. I think that it is worth mentioning.
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Mon, 07 Feb 2022 19:32:26 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that is a good point and should be fixed in the docs to be less confusing.  Thanks!
