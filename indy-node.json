{"msg":"Hi guys, I have some questions concerning the alpha network and the installation guide. During my set up I ran into two problems (following those steps: https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-environments/blob/master/vagrant/training/vb-multi-vm/TestSovrinClusterSetup.md) First install I did was on my notebook. Everything went well and I managed to run 4 agents and 4 validators inside of virtual box (setup with vagrant). At this time my pc was pretty slowed down by all these VMs so I decided to pause them and only leave 1 validator and 1 agent activly running. This is the problem: when I log in to the agent with the `vagrant ssh agent01` command beeing in the _sovrin-environments-masters/vagrant/traning/vb-multi-vm_ I the login works fine. But when I want o continue the guide and use the `sovrin` command I get that it isn't installed.","username":"Skorpion7777","ts":"2017-07-06T12:25:41.570Z"}
{"msg":"So I decided to give it another try. I rented a aws EC2 instance (with windows server). With more power than my notebook to run all agents and validators. Installation wasn't as smooth as on the notebook since i needed to use vagrant up agent/validator for every VM seperatly. The EC2 instance couldn't handle something like `vagrant up agent01 agent02` only one at a time. Anyways after having all units running I'm now running into the problem that I can't connect via ssh. I always get `ssh_exchange_identification: read: Connection reset by peer` I'm not quite shure where the problems are comming from, but I wanted to inform you. I'll be in the WG meeting later, so maybe we can discusse some issues. I'll also see if I have the time to try running the docker version before the meeting starts.","username":"Skorpion7777","ts":"2017-07-06T12:32:37.758Z"}

I have several metrics I am working on gathering to see where we are now and then we can make goals on where we want to be. I also see different performance numbers than @LoveshHarchandani partially due to the difference in our setup and partially due to how the information is gathered. Most of my numbers have been from the clients view point which includes round trip latency with the client. With the transaction timestamp I can now start to measure how quickly those transactions are being recorded in the ledger. For example when sending 3500 transactions at once (10 Client at 350 each) the client view shows a throughput of 16 per second, but the timestamp in the ledger shows those were all written at 25 per second.

{"msg":"We've been struggling with trying to get Indy-Node instances running in an OpenShift (Kubernetes) environment.  The main challenge has been because of Indy-Node's use of systemd and running as root. In thinking about solutions, the use of systemd becomes unnecessary if an assumption is made that Indy-Node will run in a container-ized environment. If you assume containers, the container is \"the service\", the container manager (eg. Kubernetes, etc) manages robustness, scaling, etc. and so having Indy-Node running without systemd becomes viable.  We think it would be a lot easier to test, more supportable and deployment becomes a lot easier (e.g. all the arguments for containers).  It does require that Stewards run a container environment, but these days, that is becoming the norm for most organizations, let alone those forward thinking enough to be running Sovrin.\n\nThoughts on that?","username":"swcurran","ts":"2017-09-19T22:25:07.458Z"}
{"msg":"I think there are some security reasons why it's assumed that Stewards doesn't use containers now.\nThe Node itself doesn't require root, it's run from 'sovrin' user. It's the node-control-tool-service that requires root. This service is responsible for auto updates (POOL_UPGRADE txn), so it stops node service, performs update (apt-get), and restarts the node service.","username":"ashcherbakov","ts":"2017-09-20T09:41:40.583Z"}
{"msg":"From my point of view, indy node must support deployment on different platforms and different nodes must be deployed different ways.

{"msg":"There are a couple of different things going on here, from my perspective.\n\n1)  There is a big difference between running a validator in a testing environment and running on in a production environment. The current thought is that for a number of reasons a production validator should run either on bare metal or on a fairly beefy VM. So, there's a bias towards that in the coding. For those running on the Sovrin Network, the Sovrin Provisional Trust Framework (https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/SovrinProvisionalTrustFramework2017-03-22.pdf) Technical Requirements basically mandate this (Section 7.1). That said, we would certainly like your participation in the working groups to discuss how containers may become a possibility in the future (ping @nage). That's also one of the best places to get the deep technical reasoning behind why certain decisions have been made.\n\n2)  The environments provided in evernym/sovrin-environments aren't part of the official release, but instead are part of a community effort to help each other build up testing environments. They certainly lag behind what is produced, and also occasionally diverge in other ways (though we try to get them back in sync as quickly as possible). I suspect that's where the running as `root` is coming from. That's not how it's suppose to be done. With this, we invite as many contributions as possible to help make the environments provided here better and easier to use. The goal of this particular repository is to provide methods to quickly set up working pools for testing--which is right in line with @swcurran's purpose.\n\nBig point, @swcurran, I love your interaction and pushing the community to make things better for everyone.","username":"tharmon","ts":"2017-09-20T17:21:46.252Z"}
{"msg":"Thanks for the response - especially pointing out the details in section 7.1 - interesting stuff.  The High Availability needs are indeed different than a \"typical\" app we deal with, so the non-container world does make sense - at least for now.  FYI - the good news is that our approach for our test network is working and we're miles ahead of where we were yesterday :-).  We're consolidating what's been done and we'll see if we have things to contribute back to the evernym/sovrin-environments codebase.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2017-09-20T17:43:10.602Z"}

{"msg":"Hi, for a proof of concept I would like to use the indy-node and the Plenum Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) Protocol for a custom purpose. I would like to send a custom request from an agent to the indy-nodes. There I would like the nodes to process the request (basically execute a custom function) and then come to consent according to BFT. The result should be sent back to the agent.\nSince the code will run locally I don’t mind adding code. My questions are: How is it possible to send a request to nodes so that the BFT Protocol is triggered? Where should I place a custom function that is executed by each node? Is there some information (demos, samples, testcases) that show how indy is executing the BFT Protocol? Thanks in advance!\n","username":"wolili","ts":"2018-01-05T10:04:12.370Z"}

This is to allow isolation between client and node traffic, so that a DOS attack on the client port will not interfere with traffic between validator nodes.  We also expect that the node port will be firewalled so that connections are only accepted from other validators, while the client port is open to any IP address.\nUnfortunately there is currently a bug so that the client port binding is to 0.0.0.0 instead of to its specific IP address. This defect will be fixed in an upcoming release, in about a month.\nThe client and node ports and IP addresses are published on the ledger, which information will be used by the other validators and client to connect to your validator. \nIn the current release, I do not see where the client and node IP addresses are configured in configuration files, but in the release where the client port is properly bound to a particular IP address, I assume that they will be configured, perhaps in /etc/indy/indy.env. @sergey-shilov , can you confirm this?\n","username":"mgbailey","ts":"2018-05-31T22:57:04.022Z"}
{"msg":"The question is how 'The client and node ports and IP addresses are published on the ledger' is done. NODE_IP and NODE_CLIENT_IP are private addresses (in my case), so the node does not know its public address. In the Steward Preparation Guide is this done by the Sovrin admin after the steward had send the node's info per email to Sovrin?","username":"AxelNennker","ts":"2018-06-01T08:12:20.755Z"}

{"msg":"@AxelNennker \"NODE_IP and NODE_CLIENT_IP are private addresses (in my case)\" - this absolutely right setup.\nRegarding the question how 'The client and node ports and IP addresses are published on the ledger' is done: each new node is added to the pool by special transaction called \"node transaction\". Each pool node and pool client gets IP/port to connect from this transaction. So that this transaction contains PUBLIC node and client IPs to be able to connect. These IPs may differ from NODE_IP and NODE_CLIENT_IP (your case with separated FW with port forwarding), but may be the same. If FW's public IP is changed then corresponding node transaction should be sent to propagate updated node info","username":"sergey-shilov","ts":"2018-06-01T09:16:14.501Z"}

{"msg":"I don't think that it is needed now... this will be done by migration script during upgrade of indy-node package. But note that this migration script gets value for NODE_IP from pool ledger, i.e. your PUBLIC IP, and sets 0.0.0.0 for NODE_CLIENT_IP as the script does not know which iface do you prefer for binding. So you can change these two parameters after upgrade is finished. We plan to provide a doc for stewards about that upgrade and binding configuration.","username":"sergey-shilov","ts":"2018-06-01T10:19:07.055Z"}

However, you do have to keep the wallet in-sync with the ledger and that can get tricky. You can use seeds to make the ledger sync up with an existing wallet for DIDs, however when you create a CredDef, it internally creates a public/private keypair without a seed, so if you have to sync a CredDef between the wallet and the ledger you are out of luck. As a result, you are generally stuck with how you are doing it.  It would be really good if you could use a Seed with a CredDef.\n\nI'm not sure about how you would go about snapshotting the ledger and wallets at the same time to enable a known startpoint for a test.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2018-06-26T02:48:12.805Z"}

{"msg":"The first network that uses Indy became available to the world in a provisional state in July 2017. At that time, the Indy codebase was given a 1.0 version number, because it had been wholly built within Sovrin, and Sovrin believed that it had reached 1.0 quality. The code was good enough to guarantee that permanent identities could be built upon it, and never lost. However, the Sovrin network itself (not its code) was given a \"provisional\" status because there were some legalities that needed time to mature, and because the deployment of the code wasn't ready for crushing traffic.\n\nNow, at that time, the code had just been transferred to Hyperledger as the Indy codebase, and Hyperledger doesn't like to assign 1.0 version numbers while projects are still in incubation. So from a Hyperledger perspective, giving the code a 1.0 version was a bit surprising.\n\nWe've worked hard to mature the code for an additional year now, and I personally think it's reasonable to build production systems upon it. Evernym (the company I work for) is doing so. The code has been released multiple times (on a semi-regular cadence), and its stability and security posture are moderately well understood. However, it is not officially out of Hyperledger's incubation status (though it's close). Whether it meets the needs of a particular production deployment scenario is something you will have to judge for yourself by reading the jira issues and inspecting the release notes of indy-node and indy-sdk.","username":"danielhardman","ts":"2018-07-27T15:34:33.308Z"}

{"msg":"Hi everyone! I've started playing around with indy, but I need your help to clarify a few points. Thanks a lot in advance!!!\n\n1. Looking at genesis files in Sovrin repo here https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/tree/master/sovrin what's the difference between `domain_transactions_*` files and `pool_transactions_*`? It seems that those \"domain\" files have \"role\" field specifying stewards/trustees, but unlike \"pool\" files, they don't contain specific IP addresses. What are the use cases for these 2 kinds of genesis files?\n\n2. I wanted to connect to Sovrin live using indy-cli. So I've created pool configuration like this:\n```\npool create live gen_txn_file=\"/Users/patrikstas/dev/hyperledger/sovrin/sovrin/pool_transactions_live_genesis\"\n``` \npointing to the sovrin genesis file https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/blob/master/sovrin/pool_transactions_live_genesis however, when I try to connect, I can't:\n```\nindy> pool connect live\nPool \"live\" has not been connected.\n```\nAlso, can I increase logging level for `indy-cli` so I could get some more info?\n\n3. In the `pool_transactions_*` genesis files, there is concept of \"node\" and \"client\".\n```\n\"client_ip\":\"127.0.0.1\",\"client_port\":9702,\"node_ip\":\"127.0.0.1\",\"node_port\":9701,\n```\nI suppose node represents the service running indy-node https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/ verifying transactions.

{"msg":"@abdfaye - this is the best document on revocation, although your first question likely needs a code review or discussion with the original developers: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0011-cred-revocation\n\nThe \"nornal\" case for Indy for updating the accumulator is only on revocation of one or a set of credentials.  That said, I believe that there is an option that can be used where the credentials must be activated on issuance and in that case the accumulator is updated on issuance and revocation.  I can't see the purpose for that latter model (lots of overhead), so I'd stick with the former.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2019-01-07T17:57:58.430Z"}

In the pool_transactions_genesis file I need to then update the information for each node what comes to the following fields:\n\"blskey\"\n\"blskey_pop\"\n\"dest\"\n\nSo far I know what keys map into these fields, but what about the \"metadata\":{\"from\": field in the pool_transactions_genesis? Should that be changed and where can I find the hash for that? And similarly, what about \"txnId\" field in the genesis file?\n\nLet's say I updated Node4 keys using the \"init_indy_keys\" and I succesfully updated the pool_transaction_genesis file. Should I also update Node4 keys in all other node's /keys folder?\nAnd what about the domain_transactions_genesis file, how should that be modified?\n\nIs it really so that this is basically the only way to rotate keys? Any improvements on the roadmap for this?\n\nThanks in advance!","username":"Jussihoo","ts":"2020-10-05T13:14:13.805Z"}

This looks like ACA-Py must accept the TAA first. I see AWS ECS provisions an appraoch to allow us to exec into the container, but I'm not sure if this could resolve this issue.

I'm finding something confusing in the documentation.\n\n```\nThe Stewards will also need to download the genesis files onto their nodes while completing the setup. All of the following steps are to be completed on the node.\n```\nand then the genesis files are added to `/var/lib/indy/<network name>`\n\nHowever, in order to create those genesis files, on `Installation and configuration of Indy-Node` documentation, it is needed to already have those files in that directory. By that tutorial, it instructs to download the genesis files of Sovrin. \n\nSo, my question is, how can I generate Verification Key and BLS, which I need for the genesis file, without having a genesis file to begin with? Not sure if I'm being clear.","username":"mateokurti","ts":"2022-02-06T20:11:58.341Z"}

{"msg":"To this question: \"how can I generate Verification Key and BLS, which I need for the genesis file, without having a genesis file to begin with?\"\nA genesis file is not required to be able to generate Verkey and BLS for a node.  When creating a new network, skip all of the steps in the validator prep guide that say anything about the genesis files, as they do not (and cannot) exist for the new network.
