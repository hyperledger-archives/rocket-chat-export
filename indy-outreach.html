One thing that we are looking to add to the Hyperledger website are pointers to material for people to get started using each of the different projects. I found the following tutorials for Hyperledger Indy that I thought I could include, but would love pointers to any additional material:
* [Hyperledger Indy Getting Started](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/stable/getting-started.md)
* [Setting up a Test Indy VM Network with Vagrant](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/stable/environment/vagrant/training/vb-multi-vm/TestIndyClusterSetup.md)
* [Setting up a DEV Environment with Vagrant](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/environment/vagrant/sandbox/DevelopmentEnvironment/Virtualbox/Vagrantfile)
* [Create a network and start nodes](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/start-nodes.md)
</p>

Thank you for setting up the channel @tkuhrt !

<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 19:04:29 GMT):<br/>
@esplinr I am about to go through the current links on https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/indy/documentation and remove the deprecated ones. I will then begin adding links to all the resources I can find that are at a reasonably polished and useful state. Once I'm finished on my end, I'd appreciate it if you could look it over and revise/add anything you feel will also be useful.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 19:04:47 GMT):<br/>
Excellent. Will do.
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 19:54:54 GMT):<br/>
I've just added all the links I think are useful. There are undoubtedly more we can add

I agree that this initiative is very good and it would definitely help. I started to develop materials for Indy for the Hyperledger meetups I'm running here in Bulgaria, but if it's useful I'd love to contribute to this initiative instead of making something on my own.
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Thu, 10 May 2018 18:33:23 GMT):<br/>
I'm happy to hear that @arjanvaneersel. What kind of materials do you think would be most helpful for you in Bulgaria?
</p>
<p><strong>arjanvaneersel</strong> (Thu, 10 May 2018 18:42:58 GMT):<br/>
My idea is to make materials with a similar approach as we do for fabric on the meetup: General principles, the network, development and deployment. However I didn’t intend to make it just for Bulgaria, but in a form that other meetups can use it as well. 
</p>
<p><strong>arjanvaneersel</strong> (Thu, 10 May 2018 18:45:08 GMT):<br/>
In March I spoke about Indy and Sovrin in Plovdiv and noticed that people are interested, but that the concept of SSI is still unknown. So I mainly spoke about that than getting into technical stuff.
</p>
<p><strong>arjanvaneersel</strong> (Thu, 10 May 2018 18:46:50 GMT):<br/>
With Fabric it’s easier, because it’s a general purpose Blockchain and doesn’t focus on solving a very specific thing like SSI.

hi all. I am new to working on marketing/PR for Hyperledger. We are writing a follow up Consensus blog for the HL site that focuses on interoperability. Can someone share a few sentences, maybe 2-3, on what concrete progress we have made or are we planning to make with #indy-outreach  on this front? Or feel free to point me to some urls, PPTs, etc. Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 20:29:43 GMT):<br/>
hi @Sarah Conway, I can share our progress for #indy-outreach, and also hope that @tkuhrt can offer her feedback as well. We are working on two initiatives to help contributors and users interact easier with Hyperledger Indy. 

First, we are consolidating all the current documentation and training resources in one place on the hyperledger wiki page: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/indy/documentation. In addition, we are creating interactive tutorials on how to use the indy-sdk and build applications that utlizing the indy-node ledger. Check out the current [getting started guide](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/getting-started/getting-started.md). 

Second, #indy-outreach pairs interested contributors and users with good first-time projects and mentors to help them get started. @kdenhartog and I are happy to meet with any contributors or interested users for 10-20 minutes and introduce them to the Indy ecosytem. We have a list of [good first bugs/projects](https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=149&projectKey=IS&view=planning&selectedIssue=IS-574&quickFilter=447) on our JIRA account.

@Sarah Conway : Still catching up from being out at Consensus. Did you reach out on the #indy channel? I assume when you ask about interoperability, you are asking about it from the perspective of how Hyperledger Indy interoperates with the other Hyperledger projects (e.g., Fabric, Sawtooth).

I will ask the same question on #indy channel. @tkuhrt would like to know about interoperability with our own projects and other blockchains. both perspectives would be interesting to include in the blog.

<p><strong>vidor</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 14:30:18 GMT):<br/>
@esplinr Do you think that Indy will implement something like the proposed Token in the Sovrin whitepaper?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 14:30:58 GMT):<br/>
No.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 14:31:32 GMT):<br/>
Hyperledger projects don't want to be in the cryptocurrency business. But we are implementing a way to plug in a payment process that will be used by Sovrin and other deployments of Indy.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 14:32:04 GMT):<br/>
So the Indy CLI in LibIndy already has a "nullpayments" interface that can be replaced with the payment method that your deployment prefers.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 14:32:30 GMT):<br/>
Does that make sense @vidor?
</p>
<p><strong>vidor</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 14:36:00 GMT):<br/>
Yes it makes sense. Thank you.
The one thing that I'm confused by is how will the payment interface work.
Will it allow to build a custom token that would help with circulating a value within a network. Or would it give the possibility to integrate external blockchains (cryptocurrencies)?
If the latter, how would the cross-chain integration work? Because if running a custom payment plugin on every indy instance that communicates with external components, it introduces non-pure functions and reaching a consensus between nodes could prove to be very hard?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 14:39:54 GMT):<br/>
The intention is that it could be used to either allow a custom token or be used to integrate external blockchains.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 14:40:21 GMT):<br/>
But there isn't yet a real implementation of either, so there are likely some unforeseen problems.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 14:40:52 GMT):<br/>
The libnullpay is expected in the next release, so this is all new ground.

A quick update on YouTube videos. I haven't got our videos published to the Hyperledger YouTube channel yet. I was going to add Hyperledger bumpers, but never got around to it. My current plan is to add them to the Evernym YouTube channel, then I can share that Playlist with Hyperledger. That will let me manage them more dynamically instead of exclusively through email.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 25 Jun 2018 22:50:43 GMT):<br/>
Concerns with the quality of the Getting Started Guides keep coming up in the Indy chat channels, and there was a brief discussion about this in the Indy Maintainers meeting this morning. I'm encouraging everyone interested to join this channel to collaborate.
To assist, I pulled together this list of issues as good starting points for long-term solutions.
* INDY-792
* INDY-1294
* INDY-1211
* IS-770
* IS-771
* IS-322
Of course, anyone who wants to fix a Getting Started Guide can immediately send a pull request and ignore the above work.

Hey Everyone! Recently, I published some information the Hyperledger Wiki Indy page in regards to what types of habits should be followed when it comes working with and maintaining the Indy documentation. Here is the link:

"Never, at any time, should there be more than one copy of an official document living in more than one place." What do we think about creating an indy-docs repo? This could help reduce confusion for users wanting to know how/where to start, and would make having an Indy ReadTheDocs possible.

I'm catching up on messages that came while I was on vacation.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 24 Jul 2018 21:40:55 GMT):<br/>
There is a trade-off between having all the docs in one place, and having the documentation in the first place someone expects to find it.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 24 Jul 2018 21:41:44 GMT):<br/>
@mjmckean How does a new developer learn about the indy-docs repository? That's the advantage to having the docs with the deliverable. But once they are in indy-docs, they have everything, which is the advantage to a single repo.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 24 Jul 2018 21:42:29 GMT):<br/>
We provided some feedback on the pull request to use ReadTheDocs for Indy-SDK. We are glad you are doing the work, but the team reviewing the PR would appreciate a bit more information about what you are doing. How does the documentation get published to ReadTheDocs?
</p>
<p><strong>mjmckean</strong> (Tue, 24 Jul 2018 21:50:44 GMT):<br/>
@esplinr thank you for the response on the PR—I’m working on a more descriptive response for the team, and I’ll get that out hopefully tonight or tomorrow morning. From what I understand, ReadTheDocs compiles documentation into an html format through a web hook that I’ve attached to my fork of indy-sdk. Each time my fork updates, the RTD recompiles.

One of the advantages of having an indy-docs repo would be to eliminate any inconvenience these cosmetic PRs create in indy-sdk and separate the consumer-facing documentation from the more gritty dev docs.

So with my current thoughts, the indy-docs repo could receive PRs from consumers and developers who think of ways to improve/update the documentation. I’m not married to this idea, I just think it would help divert certain PRs from clogging up indy-sdk.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 24 Jul 2018 21:56:56 GMT):<br/>
That's a good explanation. I'm not against an indy-docs repo. I just want to recognize the trade-offs. Perhaps it's time for a Documentation HIPE?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 24 Jul 2018 21:57:18 GMT):<br/>
I thought that ReadTheDocs directly published the markdown, so I was surprised by the build step.
</p>
<p><strong>mjmckean</strong> (Tue, 24 Jul 2018 22:08:40 GMT):<br/>
That’s what I thought initially, and there is a markdown build option, but I had trouble organizing the files into a less than random format when I built with .md. 
</p>
<p><strong>mjmckean</strong> (Tue, 24 Jul 2018 22:09:13 GMT):<br/>
If you’d like, I can throw a HIPE together this week!
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 25 Jul 2018 15:11:18 GMT):<br/>
@mjmckean Interesting to know about the ordering of markdown files. That's a big problem.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 25 Jul 2018 15:12:21 GMT):<br/>
I think I HIPE would be really useful. It could wait until next week if you are busy, but it will help so that in the next maintainers meeting we can discuss your approach and make sure that others understand what you are doing.

@swcurran was just asking me about improving the links in the wiki to the documentation.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 25 Jul 2018 18:32:30 GMT):<br/>
Specifically, looking to have added *the definitive place* for someone new to Indy to start - a pointer that is maintained over time that always points to the current "Getting Started" instructions.  The place that people like Kyle and Richard point people to on RocketChat when they ask "How do I get started?".   In the past, the challenge has been that changes, and people find the old place and start there.

We could then point them to this section of the wiki, confident that as the actual place to get started changes, it will be updated on the wiki.

I'm not sure if there are different starting places for different types of people (business, vs. devs), but if so, this section could explain that and have multiple pointers.

I can add this myself, but I'm not certain what the official starting point is right now.
</p>
<p><strong>EvelynEvergreene</strong> (Wed, 25 Jul 2018 19:29:00 GMT):<br/>
I know some of the people at sovrin have also been discussing this.

@burdettadam and I threw together a [Documentation HIPE](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/24) today. We are open to any and all feedback :)
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 18:24:20 GMT):<br/>
That Documentation HIPE is a great way for us to get organized and work in the same direction. Have you looked it over @TechWritingWhiz  ?

Notice: @mdb volunteered to work with @mjmckean to implement the idea @swcurran was pushing to create a canonical list of resources for new members of the Indy community. We're calling it the "Disneyland itinerary". Probably in the wiki, but maybe in some other location that they recommend.

They are assigned to get LibVCX merged into the Indy SDK, and could use your guidance on the right way to handle the documentation.

Preferably, we would like to start generating the API documentation as part of the CI pipeline.

@esplinr @mboyd @mjmckean have we completed Disneyland itinerary yet?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Mon, 27 Aug 2018 20:52:43 GMT):<br/>
I wrote an email that covered very similar topics as what the Disneyland itinerary might look like. Here's a good place to start since I couldn't find one ` 
1. First, I'd recommend checking out this video to understand the first use case which is implemented in our getting started guide linked to in number 3. 

2. My next recommendation would be to start exploring the main repositories of Indy and the #indy-sdk channel on Hyperledger rocketchat. Here's a good wiki that links to many great Indy resources.

3. Once you've familiarized yourself with the repositories I'd recommend going through the Getting Started Guide paying close attention to the code that calls indy functions. These are what you'll be using to build PoCs. 

4. Since this getting started guide is only one use case, the next place I'd recommend is the How To guides. The Python is kept up to date the best and node.js is the next best, by not as well kept up to date. These are guides about how to perform common actions in the Indy ecosystem like creating decentralized Identifiers, issuing credentials, and other actions related to these topics.

5. Once you've got a general understanding of these functions in the Indy-SDK you'll be ready to start writing a PoC, which is what agents are for. An agent today has the mental model of being a pieces of software that uses SSI protocols (Starting to be defined in the Indy-HIPE repo most of which are still pull requests) to accomplish some task like storing credentials and managing cryptographic keys. In the future, I expect that an agent will be any applications that consumes Indy-SDK. The mental models for a lot of this are very early, so we're still learning as we go. 

I expect that you'll have a lot of questions as you go, so when you find that things aren't clear feel free to reach out on the Indy-SDK channel or DM me on rocketchat. I'd be happy to help explain things or just generally be an advocate in connecting you with people in the community. Also since documentation is a big thing we need help with right now, if you find a solution to your problems would you mind making PRs with fixes or clarification? If you're really feeling helpful, the How-to guides for wrappers still need to be ported from python over to the other languages. That would be tremendous help in helping to build the Indy community.`

Assuming this is still accurate :-), I'm planning on adding that to the wiki shortly and I'll try to monitor to see if it changes.  I'm working on a course for Indy, so I have a vested interest in it being accurate :-).

However, if there an existing mechanism in Indy or Evernym to keep the contents up to date, it would be great to use that. E.g. a checklist that is executed each time release of a product is made.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 18:25:39 GMT):<br/>
The Sovrin Foundation has been tracking the developer documentation, so the Evernym team has focused on other areas. The backlog they have been working on is here: IS-320.

<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 01:02:53 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, may I know is there any official China developer group?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 16:58:03 GMT):<br/>
I'm not aware of an official China developer group.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 16:59:02 GMT):<br/>
I'm concerned about bringing translations of the documentation into the main repository, because we aren't equipped to keep it current over time.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 16:59:26 GMT):<br/>
@lijiachuan I suggest that we create a section in the Hyperledger wiki that links to translations of the documentation.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 16:59:55 GMT):<br/>
@lijiachuan And I forgot to say "Thank You"! It's great that you would do that.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 17:00:06 GMT):<br/>
We haven't yet discussed multi-lingual documentation much.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 17:01:29 GMT):<br/>
On other projects I contribute to, we prioritize officially translating the consumer documentation. But we only maintain the official developer documentation in English, though we link to unofficial translations.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 17:01:39 GMT):<br/>
I'm interested to know what other Indy people think.
</p>
<p><strong>jlin</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 17:38:46 GMT):<br/>
I believe most of the Composer developers are from China. You might want to try to hook up with them?
</p>
<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 21:29:46 GMT):<br/>
@esplinr so may I know what is the condition to be a translated documents which can be unofficially linked from wiki? I think you can officially created on repository for other language translated documents and it can be maintained from the community, and put one disclaimer on it. This just provide one learning approach for developers who are not good at English.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 09:54:27 GMT):<br/>
I just put together a simple development environment to run IndySDK code in a docker environment. If anyone is having trouble getting IndySDK setup or wants an easy way to develop with the SDK on any OS, check out this repo. https://github.com/kdenhartog/Indy-dev
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 21:30:31 GMT):<br/>
@lijiachuan I don't think documents linked from the wiki need to meet any quality standard. If they aren't kept up to date, we can remove them or add additional information at the point of the link.
It's reasonable to keep translations of documentation in the repository. My concern is that the documents won't be kept up to date and then people will get confused because they look official. Our current approach is that everything within the repository should always be up-to-date (though we don't currently meet that bar even with the English docs).
I'm just sharing an opinion. @mboyd had volunteered to be the owner of a documentation strategy, so I'll let him decide. Or someone else could volunteer to push forward an approach.
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-outreach?msg=A9Xh2gLhmegaQ6Xto) @lijiachuan : Have you connected with the Technical WG China #twg-china ? They have been working on translation for Fabric, and it would be good to add some folks to that group who are interested in other projects like Indy. They may also have some good ideas about ways to keep translated documents in place. Maybe we create a similar lab project to https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-docs-cn, which is a project to translate the Fabric documentation. cc: @baohua

Until official and regular maintainers exist for the documentation found in the Indy repo's (and thus change them), the standards as laid out here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/indy/contributing_docs for contributing the documentation need to be followed. Thank you.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-outreach?msg=SDsNNfsaDwcyBBrq4) @kdenhartog It's picking up steam! I think we should lock down at a safe version of libindy (1.6.2) and maybe upgrade to python3.6...ideally align it with indy-agent.  Then we could have some consistent documentation and upgrade the how-to's properly and fully with all error codes.  Going through all how-to's is at least a 2-3 week process if done well in a teaching way.

@mboyd @burdettadam any update on this HIPE? https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/24
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 23:57:12 GMT):<br/>
Good question! I've been working on a central readthedocs website that will build documentation from each of our respective repos. Today I just finished a prototype of it. The content is still a little outdated, but I think the framework will really allow us to improve developer outreach. I'm going to write up a hipe on it tonight, I think we can just close the PR you are referencing and open a new one. 

If you'd like to take a sneak peak, here's what I've been building: http://sovrin.readthedocs.io
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 23:57:41 GMT):<br/>
Id appreciate ant feedback you can give me on the hipe once its been written
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 00:03:51 GMT):<br/>
Yea, I'll give this a look. @TechWritingWhiz I'd guess you'll want to take a look at this too.
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 00:05:59 GMT):<br/>
 Each of the repositories have the option to build their docs locally, or host their own version online, but I've provided some extra features on Sovrin's readthedocs site to build all of the repositories together
I haven't edited any of the content yet, except for a little bit of organizing on the Indy-SDK repo. I'd love to get your feedback as I write my HIPE proposal 
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 00:07:31 GMT):<br/>
These have all been built from my forks of the repository [found here](https://github.com/michaeldboyd?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=indy&type=&language=)
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 00:08:21 GMT):<br/>
I've only added 4 of the indy repositories, but my plan is to add all of them. (ok, now I'll go write a HIPE)
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 00:09:20 GMT):<br/>
@mboyd On first quick glance this looks awesome! The one thing I'd add in the HIPE is how a person who wants to contribute to docs can add content, what the contribution process is, and link to this in the Introduction page so we can community source the content over time.

generally speaking both sovrin and indy have really improved their documentation over the past few months.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 07:54:37 GMT):<br/>
FYI @mboyd - I just did a big update to our VON_anchor (a python equivalent to libvcx) ReadTheDocs repo - check it out: https://von-anchor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

I added the prose sections (Anchors, Anchor Interactions, etc.), and we already had the auto-generated extractions from the code ("Code: VON Anchor Packages").

The source for the docs are here: https://github.com/PSPC-SPAC-buyandsell/von_anchor/tree/master/docs/source
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 07:56:21 GMT):<br/>
It might be helpful for you as you provide guidance to folks on how to do this.  RST is a little obscure - not my favourite - but got it working in the end. It's handling of headings is just silly (IMHO :-) ), and tables are a pain - much worse than markdown. 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 07:59:58 GMT):<br/>
I've also created a bash/docker script I can run locally to generate the docs locally and test them out.  This saves having to install and setup sphinx - the docker image contains it, so as long as I have docker and bash, I'm able to run locally.
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 15:24:20 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran This will be helpful! Good job. RST isn't my favorite either, so I think I'm going to continue support of markdown files, and have the .rst files just act as the framework for sphinx. What rst lacks, I think sphinx more than makes up for in its power and ease of use. If you end up wanting the functionality to combine multiple repositories on one readthedocs site, let me know and I'll be happy to share the process I used

@mboyd How do I change the links in the sovrin read the docs? The getting started for the Intro links to the deprecated version, which should link to the SDK version.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 23:28:05 GMT):<br/>
Eventually, I'll try to get my Indy Dev to be the original guide, but it's not to the point where I want it yet.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 23:28:54 GMT):<br/>
Still need to fix how-to guides and incorporate agents and Stephen C's education course work.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 23:29:18 GMT):<br/>
and make it docker-compose based (adding these so I can refer back when I update the repo of next things to do.)
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 23:30:46 GMT):<br/>
Right now I'm building it off of my forked indy-sdk repo, I think you could probably find the relevant document on the upstream repo and submit a pr? Once I can merge in the sphinx changes as well it will build correctly. Yes! Let's try to make a clear path to successful Indy onboarding and link to any and all useful educational resources
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 21:46:33 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog @swcurran I've published my HIPE for a new Indy documentation framework: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/63

@mboyd : Would you be amenable to us changing https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy to link to this documentation (https://indy.readthedocs.io) instead of the Github repos that we do right now in the "Get Started with Hyperledger Indy" section of the web page? Or should we leave it for now?
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 02:00:36 GMT):<br/>
I think that's a great idea @tkuhrt, but let's wait until the HIPE gets reviewed and the community is on board with the initiative
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 02:02:29 GMT):<br/>
sounds good
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 02:03:09 GMT):<br/>
The readthedocs site is still being built from my own forks of the repos, so it might be confusing if there are inconsistencies. I don't think there's a problem in informally telling people to go check it out right now, though. 
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 02:04:05 GMT):<br/>
Okay...we definitely want to wait until it is being built from the official repos. But I will definitely point people that direction who might be interested in looking at it.

The community is unofficially using the prototyped indy.readthedocs.io that is currently being built off of my own forks of the Indy repos. Merging this HIPE will allow us to build the docs through the original repos.

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 17:18:34 GMT):<br/>
I'm hesitant, but not completely opposed to tracking people reading the docs as a matter of example. Only reason I'm not completely opposed is because it generally doesn't reveal too much info to us, but Google keeps gobbling the data in.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 22:10:48 GMT):<br/>
Without the data, it is really hard to tell how to improve the documentation.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 22:47:10 GMT):<br/>
yeah, there would be some great value in knowing it. There's the alternative method of having people tell us what parts of our docs aren't good as well as identifying the persistent questions that people ask. Main reason I bring it up is because I want us limit our use of tracking as much as possible so we learn new methods to gather data with consent, but if I'm the only one bringing this concern up then don't let me hold it back.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 22:48:29 GMT):<br/>

@kdenhartog That is a good video. I think we can really use multimedia in our docs. While text based instructions are necessary, I'd like us to use video demos/tutorials liberally if possible.

@tkuhrt  I think we will go ahead with the documentation analytics. Would you help us get connect to the Google account and project ID? This also brings up a good point - right now I have an account with Readthedocs that I've used to build the prototype indy.readthedocs.io. It will probably be better if we use hyperledgers account on readthedocs to host it. I'm not sure how fabric is doing it with their docs, but we may want to talk about the best way for HL to manage this new site as well. It will require minimal maintenance.

@mboyd Hello Michael, I am familiar with Sovrin and the overall architecture and concepts.  I have installed and worked through the demo @swcurran went through on the weekly call a couple of weeks ago.  Are there education or documentation tasks that are in the queue that would help cement knowledge, and help the project move forward?  As a background, I have been more on the business side for the past while, but do have a programming background (though a little rusty).

@mxs1491 One of the biggest helps that we need is to refine our documentation to improve a new developer's experience with Hyperledger Indy. If you are willing, could you please analyze indy.readthedocs.io and tell me how to structure the docs so that new developers who are interested in using Indy within their applications have an easier time getting started? 

@infominer33's list is a great place to start. I'd love to add some of his things to our documentation. This will be a good task to start out with because it will require you to find the things that are working well, learn how to use them, and then help spread that knowledge throughout the community. 

Does that make sense? Let me know if you'd like to hop on a call at some point

@mboyd Hi Michael, I have looked through indy.readthedocs.io, looked at @infominer33 's work and here are some thoughts.  Current readthedocs structure is pretty basic.  infominer33's work provides nearly encyclopedic information around SSI.

Current readthedocs structure is pretty basic.  infominer33's work provides nearly encyclopedic information around SSI which is excellent.  I have also looked at Holochain's developer documentation (https://developer.holochain.org/guide/latest/) which I believe provides a good structure that could be used as a starting point for Indy to stitch this all together.

I do have more questions than may be useful to resolve purely by chat, so let me know if you have some time this week to discuss.

I'm getting around to the indy side of things as I go, @mxs1491 :bow: 
I'm just kinda methodical and want a thorough understanding of where Indy fits in the greater landscape (which paints quite a compelling picture, as I've learned)
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 16:59:43 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 17:02:36 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>mxs1491</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 19:45:19 GMT):<br/>
@infominer33 I'm new to this, so welcome any comments/feedback. The structure of your effort versus readthedocs versus something like what Holochain has put together.  All different flavors looking to achieve similar goals.  Do  you see any effort or technical capability reasons for a specific approach?  My two cents would be that for all the work you are putting in, it would be an awful waste to have to re-lay out all that content to fit another 'style guide'.  I do think the readthedocs or Holochain structure is a little more 'polished', but I don't have a good appreciation (yet) on how much extra work is added to meet that format.
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 19:47:08 GMT):<br/>
I'm pretty new, also, @mxs1491.
I've been studying indy and ssi over the past 5 months, 
and this is my first time as part of an open source project, so I'm just figuring out where I fit in
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 19:51:20 GMT):<br/>
Indy needs readthedocs to have a polished presentation for the world. My efforts are a bit more expansive, also.
Certainly there is room in the world for both indy.readthedocs and /awesome-ind /awesome-decentralized-id
the readthedocs will have detailed documentation from 0 to :loop: specifically about what indy is, how it works, how to run it, to the end user experience
where my github repos are mainly just supposed to be a collection of links that can assist in research "beyond the docs"

<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 19:55:00 GMT):<br/>
https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/ is a pretty shining example, as they've had the time and community support
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 19:57:25 GMT):<br/>
but from what I can tell, "the world" is kinda just starting to catch on to the fact of indy.. how transformative it is. 
so the docs gotta convey that, but it will take time.
</p>
<p><strong>mxs1491</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 20:00:16 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the pointer to the Hyperledger docs, I had not thought to look there.  From the very quick scan, the approach looks very similar to what Holochain did, so good to see on the same thought pattern.
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 20:00:24 GMT):<br/>
I think specifically work that @esplinr was talking about incorporating into indy.readthedocs.io was reproductions of this material:
https://www.ernesto.net/hyperledger-indy-architecture/
https://www.ernesto.net/ernesto-net-5-minute-course-on-indy-and-what-goes-on-the-blockchain-ledger/
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 20:01:30 GMT):<br/>
those are a nice start content wise, but the presentation could use work.
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 20:02:45 GMT):<br/>
that "what goes on the ledger" is more concise and precise (imo) than the sovrin whitepaper of that title
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 20:02:45 GMT):<br/>
this "what goes on the ledger" is more concise and precise (imo) than the sovrin whitepaper of that title
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 20:03:42 GMT):<br/>
and I don't think indy docs has an architecture page like that.. to describe the whole system in a page or two.
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 20:04:57 GMT):<br/>
and surely there are other details, and supporting information that could be filled in around that content and it will be glorious
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 20:20:33 GMT):<br/>
FYI - readthedocs just inhales RST and markdown files, so the work that @infominer33 is doing could easily be sucked into readthedocs build process.  Really just a matter of getting a good place to connect it in.  There might need to be some minor structural changes, but not much - the formatting is handled by the automated RTD process.  And it can continue to be accessed directly from github as it is now.
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Tue, 18 Dec 2018 20:25:35 GMT):<br/>
to be clear, I think what I've been doing is great and all, but mostly it's just a collection of links. 
Although, if I were writing documentation for Indy, I would probably find it pretty handy as a reference. 
That said, everything I've created on github is cc0 with no restrictions, so there's no problem of reproducing it in whole or in parts via readthedocs.
still, I've got a lot of work ahead of me before I'll have anything that *I* think is worthy of submitting to Indy Docs

At a minimum, I want to discuss where the architecture docs are, and how the Evernym team is using the "design" subdirectory for our "POA / Plan of Attack" documents as we collaborate on new features. But it would be great to discuss ReadTheDocs as well.

I don't believe so. We've not had much work on visual modeling or diagrams either other than your work so at this point I'd consider what ever you chose de facto.

PUML is used for interaction diagrams, class diagrams, and high level architecture as it's text based and therefore open and version controllable

I hadn't thought of PUML in that context. Thanks for pointing it out @jljordan_bcgov. Has anyone tried building architecture diagrams with PUML? I believe it can be done based on a quick search, but I haven't tried it before.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-outreach?msg=8WR5c2RNny4cN26aD) Both the ArchiMate and BPMN model languages are text based as well (XML) - with specific schema defined by their respective standards (XML) for help ensure interoperability between modeling tools. They are open and version controllable.  Archi, the open source modeling tool also supports direct integration with Github: https://github.com/archimatetool/archi-modelrepository-plugin.

@kdenhartog Is there a diagram that visualizes the main steps in the `indy-dev` `getting_started.py` script (https://github.com/kdenhartog/indy-dev#test-python-environment)? ...either exactly (or anything close that I can build off of).  It's a very good example - thank you.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Mon, 21 Jan 2019 16:10:40 GMT):<br/>
No, not at this time. If you want to create one it would be useful for both Indy-dev and the official getting started guide because they're the same.

@mwherman2000 Not to my knowledge, but it's been a while since I've played around with the repo. I can let @kdenhartog answer, but your best bet would be the `std_out` of one of the nodes from the docker `indy-pool.dockerfile`

A follow-up question re: this sequence diagram:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/getting-started/getting-started.svg .
Question 1: Is this diagram/scenario used for any other Indy samples/demos besides the `getting_started.py" script (https://github.com/kdenhartog/indy-dev/blob/master/python/getting_started.py)?  The reason I'm asking is that it suggests there's an agent in addition to a wallet for each of the Actors (e.g. Sovrin Steward, Government, Faber, and Trust).  From reading the Python code, I don't think this is technically accurate.  For example, ...
```
Question 2: It looks like the `run()` method calling into the Indy SDK API to work directly with Wallets and the Ledger. i.e. `getting_started.py` doesn't create or use any actual agents.  Can someone confirm this?   If true, then getting-started.svg is well... ...sort of... misleading.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-outreach?msg=2r5Mo5zgbG6Rspzs7) @jljordan_bcgov Does the VON docker image have the `python3 getting_started.py` example installed (from the `indy-dev` project)?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 00:28:58 GMT):<br/>
@mwherman2000 - not that I'm aware.  Looks like there is no VON stuff in indy-dev.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 02:06:35 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran That's correct, however I do intend to bring your browser explorer in (higher priority) and later want the von-anchor work to be able to be worked with (lower priority). I'm especially keen to start building off their dev images.

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 02:06:35 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran @mwherman2000  That's correct, `indy-dev` doesn't currently use any VON stuff. however I do intend to bring your browser explorer in (higher priority) and later want the von-anchor work to be able to be worked with (lower priority).

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-outreach?msg=WCgnGpcZGDgnHvLTA) @mwherman2000 None of the python samples are in the VON image - just the sdk, python wrapper, postgres storage and CLI
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 17:56:35 GMT):<br/>
FYI - VON Image has indy-node as well.  It was small enough that it was easier to just have it included vs. a separate one for node and sdk.

The image is still ubuntu 16.04-based, but some time was spent optimizing for size.
</p>
<p><strong>mwherman2000</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 18:47:38 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran @jljordan_bcgov @kdenhartog  I think it's important to have a single reference Docker image focused on the needs for new developers as well as experienced Indy developers.  For example, one image to focus all of our documentation, etc. around.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 22 Jan 2019 19:09:36 GMT):<br/>
Currently, there is only one docker image artifact that I'm aware of - von-image.  I agree it's important, but no ring to rule them all is probably not right.  But I agree that more sub-projects should consider a versioned container image as their artifact.

On the other end of the specturm, I cringe when I hear suggestions about using specific github branches...

FYI (what I'm working on next after the INDY ARM): Next I'm making a slow but deep dive into the Indy SDK.  The first task (which I completed this "morning") was to create a set of flow diagrams that illustrate the 201 tasks that comprise the `https://github.com/kdenhartog/indy-dev/blob/master/python/getting_started.py` script.  I've numbered each of the tasks in a hierarchical fashion (i.e. not a simple serial numbering scheme).  I'm now working (with @kdenhartog 's guidance) to add these numbers into the `getting_started.py` script itself.  So that we can have (caution: dirty word) strong correlation between the script code, the script logger msgs, the new diagrams, the sequence diagram (eventually) and the textual narration.  We're tracking this here: https://github.com/kdenhartog/indy-dev/issues/17

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-outreach?msg=mNq6DERFoxpeNesXZ) @swcurran @swcurran Does the VON Docker image run an actual Indy Agent?  `getting_started.py` is somewhat unique in that is primarily a single Python function that calls directly into the SDK to work with Wallets and the Ledger directly ...no actual intermediary Agent (as far as I can tell).

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 05:12:47 GMT):<br/>
@mwherman2000 - no it does not.  It has indy-sdk (libindy), indy-node, python and two agent components (von_anchor - object model on indy-sdk, and von-x - indy agent web service based on von_anchor).  We use those as the basis for the VON agents.  That gives us a versioned entity on which to build our agents, and to operate indy networks (hence the inclusion of indy-node).  The image makes our build process for what we are working on (agents, TheOrgBook) WAY faster than what is typically done.

FYI ...progress update: 
1. The code and the output from the `getting_started.py` script is now numbered (and correlated with the flow model/diagrams): e.g. https://github.com/mwherman2000/indy-dev/blob/master/python/doc/getting_started-numbered.log
2. The flow model/diagrams are stabilizing: https://github.com/mwherman2000/indy-dev/tree/master/python/doc/images
3. I've dropped the images into a copy of `getting_started.md` ...still very rough ...At this point, I literally just dropped the images into the existing text.  Fair bit of editing/tweaking to be completed. Here's what it currently looks like: e.g. https://github.com/mwherman2000/indy-dev/blob/master/python/doc/getting_started.md#step-0-connect-to-the-indy-nodes-pool

@kdenhartog In `getting_started.py`, the generated DIDs don't have a scheme:method prefix.  For example...
```

@mwherman2000 I think the literal strings could be added for the "did:method" onto those specific DID's

<p><strong>haggs</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 01:16:20 GMT):<br/>
Are you looking to add them there or verbosity's sake? I don't think they would have the `did:method` inside of them, as they are just wallet config "id's" to be written to the ledger.

@mwherman2000 I'm looking over at the DID Spec so our terminology is consistent (https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/)
</p>
<p><strong>haggs</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 02:01:23 GMT):<br/>
I think the correct terminology would be that the Indy SDK produces (or in actuality in Sovrin, the Indy CLI) a "specific-idstring", called "Sovrin Steward DID"
</p>
<p><strong>haggs</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 02:02:16 GMT):<br/>
This is written to the ledger and then taken into context to form the generic DID scheme, `did = "did:" method ":" specific-idstring"`
</p>
<p><strong>mwherman2000</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 02:07:20 GMT):<br/>
Then these methods need to be renamed to reflect that and a new set of replacement methods (with the old method names) created that return valid DIDS.

Moving this thread back to #indy-outreach ... FYI: For https://github.com/mwherman2000/indy-dev/blob/master/python/getting_started-verbose.py to use syntactically valid DIDs (and not idstrings), I wrote some idstring <> DID wrappers: https://github.com/mwherman2000/indy-dev/blob/master/python/getting_started-verbose.py#L771-L815
Now `getting_started-verbose.py` only uses DIDs from a [workshop] developer perspective.
For example,
```
INFO:__main__:1.1.1 "Sovrin Steward" -> Create and store in Wallet "Sovrin Steward Government" DID (from to)
Create and store DID from DID: did:mymethod:Th7MpTaRZVRYnPiabds81Y
Create and store DID from_to DID: did:mymethod:WDFUCaFHrqQdMhCgbVMZ6h
INFO:__main__:1.1.2 "Sovrin Steward" -> Send NYM for "Sovrin Steward Government" DID (from to) to Ledger
SEND_NYM: {"reqId":1548960780222513800,"identifier":"Th7MpTaRZVRYnPiabds81Y","operation":{"dest":"WDFUCaFHrqQdMhCgbVMZ6h","type":"1","verkey":"GvRZogqnpDf73aVCDLsWwoE8wHN4BZS5RQnj45zoZp2M"},"protocolVersion":2}
INFO:__main__:1.1.3 "Sovrin Steward" -> Send Connection Request to Government with "Sovrin Steward Government" DID and Nonce (simulated)
Connection Request: {"did": "did:mymethod:WDFUCaFHrqQdMhCgbVMZ6h", "nonce": 123456789}

```

idstrings are still used on the Ledger.

<p><strong>SteveGoob</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 23:37:08 GMT):<br/>
That's the one, thank you @haggs 
</p>
<p><strong>SteveGoob</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 23:39:07 GMT):<br/>
@esplinr, I want to get it reviewed for accuracy, completeness, and to make sure Indy does have all the functionality to provide for these use cases *right now*
</p>
<p><strong>SteveGoob</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 23:40:23 GMT):<br/>
Otherwise, it shouldn't be on the use cases document, as it's a metric for determining whether the product is complete enough for 1.0
</p>
<p><strong>SteveGoob</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 23:41:13 GMT):<br/>
If you have some eyes that could help out with that verification, it would be very appreciated. 
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 23:41:30 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. That sounds like something @techwritingw

<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 23:41:30 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. That sounds like something @TechWritingWhiz , @kdenhartog  and I can help with.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 23:42:36 GMT):<br/>
Especially with regards to accuracy and that the functionality already exists to fulfill the use cases.
I'm more nervous about "completeness", as we have literally hundreds of use cases we have put together at Evernym. We probably want to focus on the 10 most interesting ones like you have in the doc.

<p><strong>SteveGoob</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 23:43:40 GMT):<br/>
By completeness, I'm more referring to the distribution and generality of the use cases themselves. 
</p>
<p><strong>SteveGoob</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 23:45:28 GMT):<br/>
I don't want 6 use cases about passwords and websites, and only 1 about a digital drivers license, for example
</p>
<p><strong>SteveGoob</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 23:46:20 GMT):<br/>
I'd like the use cases to be fewer, more general, and adequately distributed across industries and applications. 
</p>
<p><strong>SteveGoob</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 23:48:43 GMT):<br/>
Either way, we just need an MVP that the community can continue to edit and contribute to after it's in the wiki

Just a heads up everyone: My employment with Evernym has recently ended. I've updated my profile information and I'll log back in here periodically to see if I'm able to be of assistance. The next two to three weeks will be spent doing other things as I search for another position as a Technical Writer, but I'm always happy to help here when possible.

Context: I've been working on visualizing @kdenhartog 's version of the Getting Started python script including adding numbering to the script that makes it easy to directly correlate each task in the script source code with each diagram and with the console output generated by the script (e.g. https://github.com/mwherman2000/indy-dev/blob/master/python/doc/getting_started-5.0%20Raw%20Message%20Flows.md).  
I now want to fold the diagrams into the text of the "best version" of the longer descriptive narration of the "Alice buys a car" scenario.
Question: What is the "best version of the longer descriptive narration of the "Alice buys a car" scenario" for me to use?  ...for example, is it this one? https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/docs/getting-started/indy-walkthrough.md  CC: @mboyd

FYI: I've found a specific, and I believe useful, focus and scope for the Indy Getting Started project I've been working on (let's just say for quite some time now :-)).  I'm looking forward to finishing the first complete draft this week. Checkout https://github.com/mwherman2000/indy-dev/blob/master/python/doc/getting_started-enterpise.md#hyperledger-indy-getting-started-guide-for-enterprise-architects-and-developers-gsg-ea

Abstract

The _HyperLedger Indy Getting Started Guide for Enterprise Architects and Developers (GSG-EA)_ documents an end-to-end framework for taking a business problem represented by the _Alice Buys a Car_ user story and how to work through the analysis, design, and implementation of an executable self-sovereign identity (SSI) solution that addresses the requirements of this (or any similar purchasing) user story. This guide also introduces the use of several enterprise architecture concepts into the new world of SSI application analysis, design, and implementation. To achieve this goal, the guide using the ArchiMate visual modeling language and the Archi open source, enterprise modeling tool for analysis and design. The implementation is a simple Python script. Architects and developers who are new to the HyperLedger Indy SSI software platform and the Sovrin SSI governance framework will gain significant new knowledge and understanding about the design and implementation of SSI solutions using the approach documented in this guide.

<p><strong>mwherman2000</strong> (Fri, 08 Mar 2019 16:56:07 GMT):<br/>
While modeling the Indy/Sovrin roles for the "Alice Buys a Car" scenario (https://github.com/mwherman2000/indy-dev/blob/master/python/doc/getting_started-enterpise.md#additional-actors), I found the Sovrin Glossary to be very useful from a data and knowledge perspective but it wasn't of much help when it came to understanding the relationships between and across roles.  Yesterday, this gave birth to what will become the Sovrin Governance Comprehensive Architecture Reference Model (SOVRIN ARM): https://github.com/mwherman2000/sovrin-arm/blob/master/README.md
So far, it's just focused on actors and their Sovrin roles (that start with the letters A through H :-))   Feedback appreciated.  What would you like to see added next?

I'm not aware of such a list. There are various businesses and independent consultants who specialize in Indy, but no directory of providers.

@gskerry You can ask in  #indy for consultants interested in the work. My employer (Evernym) can also help out with many of these projects.

I created a new documentation index page, since we didn't have one in the new wiki. It has an easy place to add community resources.

It is better than what we had, but it needs a lot more work.

I incorporated much of the information on the old page. It is now better than what we had, but it needs a lot more work.

Does anyone have any good training material for helping folks develop applications that use Hyperledger Indy?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 11 Nov 2019 23:47:31 GMT):<br/>
Hey @tkuhrt - we've developed an Indy/Aries/Ursa edX course for the Linux Foundation that should launch on Nov. 21. It's not a devs course, but provides an overview to the technology.  We're working on a follow up course to be launched in early 2020 that does target devs.

For devs, you could use this as a starting place - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/tree/master/docs/GettingStartedAriesDev. Not complete yet, but it should provide sufficient context.

@swcurran , thanks for the great course about Indy/Aries/Ursa on edX. Here I need your some helps for an problem I am encountering. I already setup one VON network in one VM server, then I plan to use Aries Cloud Agent to setup one agent, based on this document https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/DevReadMe.md#docker, after I run "scripts/run_docker --version", there are two docker images created aries-cloudagent-run and bcgovimages/von-image, and I think to have one new agent, I should use the provision command to provision a new agent, then use the start command to start a new agent, is my understanding correct? I tried to use "scripts/run_docker provision" to create one agent for node 1, with different parameters such as --genesis-url with my genesis file's URL, --seed with my node1's seed value, but it didn't go through. May I have a sample provision command script as a reference? This document has one sample start command script, that is very useful. Hope can have your guidance here. Thanks.

I've pinged the devs to help.  We have examples in a couple of repos of starting ACA-Py that might help - https://github.com/bcgov/identity-kit-poc (a verifier), https://github.com/bcgov/indy-email-verification.

The aca-py start command to start the Identity-Kit-Poc is here: https://github.com/bcgov/identity-kit-poc/blob/118ac5a398447fc7ff75f74eb4101e60440eb641/docker/docker-compose.yml#L196

A colleague has just brought "BlokSec" to my attention. Does anyone know if they are part of the "Decentralized Identity" community (i.e. Hyperledger Aries/Indy, DIF, etc.)? https://www.bloksec.com

Question - what are the top 3 HL-Indy improvements that we would all like to see. As ideas I have heard from many leaders the following - in no particular order:
* did:indy support 
* DID Document support native to the ledger (as opposed to using Universal Resolver)
* KERI support - anchoring KERI data into the Indy ledger
* embedded support for JSON or JSON-LD BBS+ credentials (I note ongoing debate over JSON/JSON-LD and the lack of predicate support in BBS+)
* other ideas that I have managed to lose!
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 22 Sep 2021 19:28:48 GMT):<br/>
Some notes: 

- "did:indy" as defined would provide support for using JSON-LD/BBS+ VCs.  "did:indy" includes support for arbitrary DIDDocs on an Indy ledger, and once you have that, you can support the keys needed for BBS+.  Note that for JSON-LD signature VCs (the "sign the whole credential" approach) -- Indy has the necessary support already. 
- With the "did:indy" support, stretching it to support a KERI mechanism is a relatively small step.
- With "did:indy" implemented, stretching it to add native DIDDoc support (e.g. a transaction that returns the DIDDoc directly) is a pretty small step.
- For those not aware -- "did:indy" provides (a) a way to reference the ledger of the identifier in the did, and (b) full DIDDoc support.
