Or would it give the possibility to integrate external blockchains (cryptocurrencies)?\nIf the latter, how would the cross-chain integration work? Because if running a custom payment plugin on every indy instance that communicates with external components, it introduces non-pure functions and reaching a consensus between nodes could prove to be very hard?","username":"vidor","ts":"2018-05-23T14:36:00.552Z"}

{"msg":"I wrote an email that covered very similar topics as what the Disneyland itinerary might look like. Here's a good place to start since I couldn't find one ` \n1. First, I'd recommend checking out this video to understand the first use case which is implemented in our getting started guide linked to in number 3. \n\n2. My next recommendation would be to start exploring the main repositories of Indy and the #indy-sdk channel on Hyperledger rocketchat. Here's a good wiki that links to many great Indy resources.\n\n3. Once you've familiarized yourself with the repositories I'd recommend going through the Getting Started Guide paying close attention to the code that calls indy functions. These are what you'll be using to build PoCs. \n\n4. Since this getting started guide is only one use case, the next place I'd recommend is the How To guides. The Python is kept up to date the best and node.js is the next best, by not as well kept up to date. These are guides about how to perform common actions in the Indy ecosystem like creating decentralized Identifiers, issuing credentials, and other actions related to these topics.\n\n5. Once you've got a general understanding of these functions in the Indy-SDK you'll be ready to start writing a PoC, which is what agents are for. An agent today has the mental model of being a pieces of software that uses SSI protocols (Starting to be defined in the Indy-HIPE repo most of which are still pull requests) to accomplish some task like storing credentials and managing cryptographic keys. In the future, I expect that an agent will be any applications that consumes Indy-SDK. The mental models for a lot of this are very early, so we're still learning as we go. \n\nI expect that you'll have a lot of questions as you go, so when you find that things aren't clear feel free to reach out on the Indy-SDK channel or DM me on rocketchat. I'd be happy to help explain things or just generally be an advocate in connecting you with people in the community. Also since documentation is a big thing we need help with right now, if you find a solution to your problems would you mind making PRs with fixes or clarification? If you're really feeling helpful, the How-to guides for wrappers still need to be ported from python over to the other languages.

In effect, `run()` is simulating all of the agents at once. Can someone confirm this?

To achieve this goal, the guide uses the ArchiMate visual modeling language standard and the Archi open source, enterprise modeling tool for analysis and design. The implementation is a simple Python script. Architects and developers who are new to the HyperLedger Indy SSI software platform and the Sovrin SSI governance framework will gain significant new knowledge and understanding about the design and implementation of SSI solutions using the approach documented in this guide.\nCC: @danielhardman @kdenhartog @nage @swcurran @John_Jordan @pknowles ","username":"mwherman2000","ts":"2019-03-05T17:37:01.731Z"}

{"msg":"While modeling the Indy/Sovrin roles for the \"Alice Buys a Car\" scenario (https://github.com/mwherman2000/indy-dev/blob/master/python/doc/getting_started-enterpise.md#additional-actors), I found the Sovrin Glossary to be very useful from a data and knowledge perspective but it wasn't of much help when it came to understanding the relationships between and across roles.  Yesterday, this gave birth to what will become the Sovrin Governance Comprehensive Architecture Reference Model (SOVRIN ARM): https://github.com/mwherman2000/sovrin-arm/blob/master/README.md\nSo far, it's just focused on actors and their Sovrin roles (that start with the letters A through H :-))   Feedback appreciated.

{"msg":"@swcurran , thanks for the great course about Indy/Aries/Ursa on edX. Here I need your some helps for an problem I am encountering. I already setup one VON network in one VM server, then I plan to use Aries Cloud Agent to setup one agent, based on this document https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/DevReadMe.md#docker, after I run \"scripts/run_docker --version\", there are two docker images created aries-cloudagent-run and bcgovimages/von-image, and I think to have one new agent, I should use the provision command to provision a new agent, then use the start command to start a new agent, is my understanding correct? I tried to use \"scripts/run_docker provision\" to create one agent for node 1, with different parameters such as --genesis-url with my genesis file's URL, --seed with my node1's seed value, but it didn't go through. May I have a sample provision command script as a reference? This document has one sample start command script, that is very useful. Hope can have your guidance here.

Note that for JSON-LD signature VCs (the \"sign the whole credential\" approach) -- Indy has the necessary support already. \n- With the \"did:indy\" support, stretching it to support a KERI mechanism is a relatively small step.\n- With \"did:indy\" implemented, stretching it to add native DIDDoc support (e.g. a transaction that returns the DIDDoc directly) is a pretty small step.\n- For those not aware -- \"did:indy\" provides (a) a way to reference the ledger of the identifier in the did, and (b) full DIDDoc support.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2021-09-22T19:28:48.742Z"}
