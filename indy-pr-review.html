@gudkov my idea for IS-201 is something like this:
```

	public interface ListenerObserver {

		public ConnectionObserver onListener(Agent.Listener listener);
	}

	public interface ConnectionObserver {

		public MessageObserver onConnection(Agent.Listener listener, Agent.Connection connection, String senderDid, String receiverDid);
	}

	public interface MessageObserver {

		public void onMessage(Agent.Connection connection, String message);
	}

```
</p>

<p><strong>peacekeeper</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 09:27:05 GMT):<br/>
so e.g. when there is a new connection, ConnectionObserver.onConnection() is called, and the library user has to return a MessageObserver for messages that arrive on that connection
</p>
<p><strong>peacekeeper</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 09:27:47 GMT):<br/>
and when a listener is opened, ListenerObserver.onListener() is called, and the library user has to return a ConnectionObserver for new connections on that listener
</p>
<p><strong>peacekeeper</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 09:29:17 GMT):<br/>
not sure if it's the best approach, maybe you prefer a different design
</p>
<p><strong>gudkov</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 09:56:19 GMT):<br/>
I am not sure that we need ListenerObserver. Agent.Listener must be returned as resilt of Future in agentListen call.
</p>
<p><strong>gudkov</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 09:57:45 GMT):<br/>
According to ConnectionObserver and MessageObserver  let's try to follow this way.

@gudkov As discussed today on the call, maybe you can review+merge this (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/173) first, which should make custom wallets working. And then @srottem + I and others can further discuss higher-level functionality for custom wallets (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/160)

@jljordan_bcgov it looks like you're PR is against the hyperledger-archives, what link or project did you use to get you there?  (indy-client is retired, and that information and code should now exist inside of indy-node)

It's hardly the most important thing, but I'd propose 4 spaces if it were my product.

INDY-894 Update verbiage in Getting Started Guide
Please Review: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/386

Updates verbiage in Getting Started Guide to reflect small changes due
to removing branding from Sovrin to Indy. I also updated verbiage
throughout to reflect actors specifically, where it made sense to do
so for the sake of clarity. Example, instead of just saying "Indy", I
changed it to "Indy code base" or "the ledger" or "the network."

@bendon and @ashcherbakov I believe it was hung up by the agreement between Evernym and the Sovrin Foundation, not Hyperledger (as far as I know).  @Sean_Bohan is reaching out to @tkuhrt and @jlaw 1 to get it resolved correctly.

@sergey.minaev @gudkov when I was building on top of this, I ended up having to change the functions in the trait. I wasn't able to figure out why, but the compile suggested it, so I did and it worked. I decided not to add the new functions to the crypto_type because I didn't understand what the implications might be. Would you suggest that I add these?

@gudkov   updates made to postgres wallet storage https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1282 ...  There has also been a suggestion to move this to a separate repo, rather than adding to indy-sdk, let me know if I should create a separate repo for this or if it will be merged into indy-sdk

@sasiedu Which JIRA board? And what is your need for it?
</p>
<p><strong>sasiedu</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 05:50:07 GMT):<br/>
@esplinr indysdk board, under community contribution. It's a golang wrapper for indysdk
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 15:12:24 GMT):<br/>
@sasiedu I think you just have to be a logged in user to access the IndySDK board. Are you not seeing it?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 15:13:38 GMT):<br/>
I see that you created an epic for the golang wrapper (thank you!). Is your concern that you want it to be tracked as an in-progress community contribution?
</p>
<p><strong>sasiedu</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 15:53:56 GMT):<br/>
@esplinr KitHat moved it to community contribution. but I have submitted a pull request for that task. It should be in review
</p>
<p><strong>KitHat</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 16:03:43 GMT):<br/>
@esplinr I have moved it to Community Contribution from our EV sprint, I thought it is a correct place, isn't it?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 16:03:55 GMT):<br/>
Yes it is.
</p>
<p><strong>sasiedu</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 16:16:43 GMT):<br/>
@esplinr I don't have a problem with it. Just not sure who to tag for review
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 16:18:02 GMT):<br/>
We need to figure out the best way to handle wrappers that aren't directly required by the SDK. They don't get the same level of attention as the ones that are integrated into the CI / CD.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 16:18:30 GMT):<br/>
My opinion is that they should live in their own repositories, and we should create a list of such wrappers in the Hyperledger wiki so that they are easy to find.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 16:19:09 GMT):<br/>
My team doesn't have experience with Go, so we aren't well positioned to provide feedback on the wrapper or to help maintain it.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 16:19:43 GMT):<br/>
@sasiedu I'm glad you wrote the wrapper and I expect it will be useful to many people. But should it live within the SDK repository?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 16:20:52 GMT):<br/>
If you keep it in a separate GitHub repository, how do we help people find it? Is it best to have a wiki page, or to have a file in the SDK repo that lists recommended wrappers?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 16:21:16 GMT):<br/>
We've debated these questions off and on over the last few months, and your wrapper gives us a good opportunity to decide on a policy.
</p>
<p><strong>sasiedu</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 18:23:29 GMT):<br/>
@esplinr I don't mind if sits outside of the SDK repo and have file in the repo that lists recommended wrappers and later added to the repo. The problem is if it doesn't match up to the indysdk wrapper standards
</p>
<p><strong>sasiedu</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 18:25:07 GMT):<br/>
and are the dotnet, node, java and python official wrappers??
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 19:36:53 GMT):<br/>
We don't really talk in terms of "official".
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 19:37:00 GMT):<br/>
The question is who maintains something.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 19:37:16 GMT):<br/>
.NET has no clear maintainer at the moment, so we have been talking about taking it out of the repo. Node and Java are maintained by Evernym. Python is used by Indy Node and so is required for the CI / CD to complete and is maintained by the team.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 19:38:03 GMT):<br/>
We are discussing whether we should remove from the repo wrappers that are not required for CI / CD, but Node and Java are required for the current reference agents so that might mean they should stay.
</p>
<p><strong>sasiedu</strong> (Sat, 15 Dec 2018 16:20:26 GMT):<br/>
okay, then I will create an external repo and send link, if someone wants to use it
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 20:32:29 GMT):<br/>
@sasiedu We discussed it as a team at Evernym, and we are in favor of adding the link in the README inside the official SDK repo. If you do the PR, you will appear as GitHub an official contributor (with perks like being able to vote in the next Hyperledger election).
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 20:32:41 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for making this wrapper avaiable.

Hi all, I'm hoping to have the docs/ folders with support for readthedocs ready by Friday. All of the remaining merge conflicts have been resolved. The Hyperledger admins are meeting with me to configure the site with their RTD account. Would the respective maintainers be able to review these PRs when convenient?

Hi there, I just submitted a PR for the iOS wrapper. I don't have access to JIRA though so I haven't added a ticket there. Here's the PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/1582
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 19:57:56 GMT):<br/>
@cobear25 Thank you for the PR. The maintainers are short handed at the moment due to vacations and other projects, but we'll review it when we can.

<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 21:36:16 GMT):<br/>
But it's currently taking us a few weeks.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 21:37:12 GMT):<br/>
We recently did some work on the iOS wrapper, so we might already have the environments necessary to test.
</p>
<p><strong>cobear25</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 21:53:15 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, I saw the changes that went in last week and they were super helpful to get it up and running on the latest iOS and swift version. The wrapper just didn't have all the functionality we need at the moment.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 22:10:07 GMT):<br/>
Your contribution will speed that along a lot. Thank you again.

Really impressive! Is a `pass` really all that is needed for those methods when the `LibindyCommand` decorator is used?

Hey dbluhm
Yes!
Only if youre adding new data-types you will need to add a bit more. But everything else is really that easy ;)
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Mon, 12 Aug 2019 13:53:34 GMT):<br/>
@JeromeK what was the motivation for grouping the functions into classes as static methods as opposed to just having a module with plain functions?
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Mon, 12 Aug 2019 14:14:57 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm 
Its just because of the importing, you could also do with plain functions - does not matter ;)

@sergey.minaev Jenkins build is failed, but I don't have a permission to get into the Jenkins... Can you please let me know the reason why a build is failed for the PR https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/2132. When I built the project in my local machine, there was no problem.

Indy gurus, I'd appreciate some feedback on this PR:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/2179 ...  It adds support to proof validation so that predicates can support restrictions of the form `"restrictions": [{ ..., "attr::name::value": "Alex" }]` (currently with these kinds of restrictions in predicates the proof process will work up to the validation step and then fail)
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 29 May 2020 21:36:00 GMT):<br/>
The issue is logged here:  https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/IS-1557

Thank you for review and merging my pull request.
By the way, I pointed out that the implementation does not match the specification in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/2238, but there was no response. Because I am not sure the specification is correct or not, I did not add document change in the last pull request.
Then, I created a new issue about it and a pull request.
According to the esplinr's mention, I did not create the issue on Jira but on GitHub.
I would be grateful if you could let me know if the procedure is not correct.

I noticed that the indy-sdk's Rust language wrapper was written for Rust 2015, so I updated it to Rust 2018 and created a PR.  However, I'm hung up on the DCO process.  I'm getting a message that says: 

"remote: Permission to hyperledger/indy-sdk.git denied to mccown.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403"

Any pointers on how to proceed?

Here is the PR that I'm trying to submit:

https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/2435
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 13 Oct 2021 16:55:35 GMT):<br/>
You need to DCO sign all your commits (`git commit -s ...` or `git commit --signoff ...` I think ...)
</p>
<p><strong>mccown</strong> (Wed, 13 Oct 2021 18:00:07 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the tip.  I fixed the DCO.  It sure is easier to do that on the initial commit rather than trying to correct that later.
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 13 Oct 2021 18:13:11 GMT):<br/>
Looks like you now have a conflict in your PR
</p>
<p><strong>mccown</strong> (Wed, 13 Oct 2021 18:16:01 GMT):<br/>
I see the conflict of "libindy/Cargo.lock".  I didn't have one in my PR (I think), so I don't know how to delete it.  It says "Only those with write access to this repository can merge pull requests."

It usually means there are updates on the main branch that you haven't merged into your fork
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 13 Oct 2021 18:44:32 GMT):<br/>
Try merging the latest code into your fork and see if you get a local conclict

<p><strong>mccown</strong> (Wed, 13 Oct 2021 18:55:26 GMT):<br/>
I'm reading through both main and my PR and I think what's happening is that main has a libindy/Cargo.lock file, while I deleted it from my PR.  Since cargo rebuilds the lock files, I didn't think it was a problem.  Now, I'm not sure how to go about fixing it...
</p>
<p><strong>mccown</strong> (Wed, 13 Oct 2021 19:03:27 GMT):<br/>
I just tested building libindy locally and verified that cargo recreates the .lock files and the build finishes successfully.
</p>
<p><strong>mccown</strong> (Thu, 14 Oct 2021 18:40:14 GMT):<br/>
I figured out the DCO issue.  I hadn't signed the PR before I submitted it, so I had to figure out how to sign after submission.  Now, it's held up on a Cargo.lock file problem in the Jenkins process.  I removed the Cargo.lock files before submitting my PR, since cargo rebuilds them.  I guess that's causing a problem.  I don't have merge access, so I can't resolve it.  Any help is appreciated.

<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 14 Oct 2021 18:59:09 GMT):<br/>
Your indy-sdk fork is showing as `6 commits behind hyperledger:master`, so you need to catch up your local fork first.  I suspect that will give you the conflict locally, so then when you fix it locally it will fix the PR
</p>
<p><strong>mccown</strong> (Thu, 14 Oct 2021 21:54:35 GMT):<br/>
@ianco got it.  Since I don't use github / jenkins often, I ended up closing the previous PR and created an updated one, which should be ready to go.
