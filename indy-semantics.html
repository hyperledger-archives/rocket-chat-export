Very nice, @pknowles. I hope your SSI Meetup webinar went well today—my lunch with the University of Washington (who is very seriously looking into Hyperledger Indy and SSI) went long so I wasn't able to attend. But I'll watch the recording on SSI Meetup.

Due to the amalgamation of all data capture and semantics initiatives being undertaken on Hyperledger Indy, a new *Semantics WG* has been implemented in place of the old *Schemas and Overlays WG*. Our first meeting under the new name will take place on Tuesday, November 27th providing an opportunity for members of the community to discuss any HL Indy semantics initiatives they've been working on. Here is the agenda and dial-in information for Tuesday's meeting ...

<p><strong>darrell.odonnell</strong> (Sat, 01 Dec 2018 15:44:56 GMT):<br/>
@pknowles consider the following business case - I want to consider providing a Sovrin-backed Verifiable Credential from a credit union. My "dream state" would allow a combination of static data (e..g. "MemberSince", "Institution Name") and some dynamic data (e.g. "Average Monthly Balance", "Good Customer Standing"). 

I recognize that the current Verifiable Creds, particularly with the ZKP support, require totally new credentials when any data change. Does the current Overlay concept allow data augmentation - combining live/dynamic data from other sources with the VerCred static data?
</p>
<p><strong>darrell.odonnell</strong> (Sat, 01 Dec 2018 15:47:19 GMT):<br/>
if you could point me at the most current docs I would like to include reference to the Overlays (and Schema) work that you've been working on so hard. I am publishing a report with some experts in the Sovrin/Indy space about Digital Wallets and what they need to become. Overlays is a key feature. 
</p>
<p><strong>pknowles</strong> (Sat, 01 Dec 2018 16:47:04 GMT):<br/>
@darrell.odonnell In short, yes, the Overlays architecture will allow the capture of static data with dynamic augmentation from a combination of different internal or external sources. I'll DM you for some more specifics so that I can draft a hypothetical Overlays solution for your particular use case. In the meantime, although still in draft, the following two documents are the most current and relevant to your query: (i.) *Schema Overlays* - https://github.com/mitfik/overlays-demo/blob/master/SOD.md and (ii.) *Consent Receipt* - https://github.com/JanLin/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/consent_receipt

<p><strong>pknowles</strong> (Sat, 01 Dec 2018 16:47:04 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran There are new pieces being added all the time. The data capture architecture has evolved beyond the 101 sessions. In terms of Darrell's query, I see dynamic data being closely aligned with the consent definitions on those particular attributes which we can capture via a combination of consent attributes in the schema definition, a consent overlay and a proof schema.
</p>

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 01 Dec 2018 21:14:17 GMT):<br/>
@pknowles is that new since the 101 sessions you've been doing? I can't see how the type of dynamic data @darrell.odonnell is talking about is possible with the overlays model I have seen. He wants dynamic data per credential, not per schema.
</p>
<p><strong>pknowles</strong> (Sat, 01 Dec 2018 21:25:00 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran The 101 sessions have since evolved and we're adding pieces that should be able to deal with Darrell's use case. I see the handling of dynamic data being closely aligned with the consent definitions on those particular attributes which we can capture via a combination of consent attributes in the schema definition, a consent overlay and a proof schema.

</p>
<p><strong>pknowles</strong> (Sat, 01 Dec 2018 21:26:06 GMT):<br/>
From my side, if the Issuer has the ability to dictate the conditions defining the consent window, an automated tool could be built to pull in dynamic data at regular intervals without breaking the overlay terms.
</p>
<p><strong>pknowles</strong> (Sat, 01 Dec 2018 21:29:17 GMT):<br/>
@brentzundel also added his thoughts from a *Credential Definition* perspective: "To enable the presentation of dynamic data, the prover could possibly issue the verifier a credential that allows it to access an endpoint which would resolve as the source of dynamic data. The encoding of this end point could be static, signed by the issuer, and revealed to the verifier as part of the proof. This would only be okay if the issuer controls the data provided at the endpoint, but the prover controls access to the endpoint."
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 01 Dec 2018 21:29:35 GMT):<br/>
But it still relies on the issuance of a credential so that it can be proven. Regardless of the automation around the event, it still means using a verifiable credential - I can't see getting around that.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 01 Dec 2018 21:32:56 GMT):<br/>
Your last point is interesting - seems technically challenging, especially with the desire for a Holder to prove claims independent of the issuer. Seems that might need to be given up?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 01 Dec 2018 21:33:36 GMT):<br/>
Perhaps the benefit of the dynamic data would be worth the trade off?
</p>
<p><strong>pknowles</strong> (Sat, 01 Dec 2018 21:36:05 GMT):<br/>
It's definitely an interesting use case and an important one at that. Our next *Semantics WG* meeting is on *Tuesday, December 11th* ( *10am-11am PT* ). I'm going to add this as an agenda item. It'll be good to get this one aired for sure.

Is there a reference to the dynamic data as described above? I think I get the idea, except how the dynamic data can be handled in a proof. Harri from (I think) Tieto did something like that to grant access to data, but it was just a feed of raw data, but encapsulated as a proof.

Which may be just fine. 

Don't quite see the connection to overlays, but I'm interested in reading/hearing more.

All of the consent definitions are bound by entries in a Consent Overlay. If those terms are not dictated by the Issuer, in this case, then they wouldn't necessarily have the legal right to collect dynamic data over a predefined period. I guess until we nut this out, we may be over thinking it but I see dynamic data collection as a combination of verifiable credential and consent terms.

@harrihoo I've added you to this channel so that we can get your thoughts on dynamic data collection. See conversation above which @darrell.odonnell kicked off. @swcurran suggested that in the recent past you have managed to grant access to dynamic data via a raw data feed, not encapsulated as a proof. Are you able to explain that piece or point us to a reference document?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-semantics?msg=7RjLgFDesYJM8jXHz) @darrell.odonnell @darrell.odonnell Base on my understanding one of possible way to make it work could be like this: you use schema + overlays to describe verifiable credential structure. Let say your verifiable credential is issued by Credit Union and could look like this:
```
   SCHEMA = {
    did: "did:sov:abcdefg123455",
    name: 'Dream state',
    description: "Created by Darrell",
    version: '1.0',
    attr_names: {
      MemberSince: Date,
      InstitutionName: String
      AverageMonthlyBalance: Double,
      GoodCustomerStanding: Integer
    },
    consent: "did:schema:27312381238123", # reference to consent schema
    # Attributes flagged according to the Blinding Identity Taxonomy
    # by the issuer of the schema
    bit_attributes: ["MemberSince"],
}
```
Next when you create verifiable credentials according to the schema you bind static variables same way as you do it now (including ZKP) and for dynamic attributes likes `AverageMonthlyBalance` you bind it to the did source. Let say that overlay could look like this:
```
DYNAMIC_OVERLAY = {
  did: "did:sov:57ass8abcd",
  type: "spec/overlay/1.0/dynamic",
  name: "Dynamic Overlay for Dream State",
  dynamic_attributes: {
      AverageMonthlyBalance: "did:sov:0987poiu",
      GoodCustomerStanding: "did:sov:0987poiu",
  }
}
```
Which basically mean that you bind attribute `AverageMonthlyBalance` and `GoodCustomerStanding` to specific source from where they can come. Which could mean that each time when you would fetch the dynamic attributes they have to be signed by those specific DID's defined in that overlay. 

Would that work/make sens?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-semantics?msg=7RjLgFDesYJM8jXHz) @darrell.odonnell Base on my understanding one of possible way to make it work could be like this: you use schema + overlays to describe verifiable credential structure. Let say your verifiable credential is issued by Credit Union and could look like this:
```
   SCHEMA = {
    did: "did:sov:abcdefg123455",

So even when you agree on something by creating verifiable credentials you agree on the specific static fields right away and on some dynamic attributes just agree who in the future would deliver those attributes (so you create trusted binding between attribute and some entity (his did) which commit to provide it/update it in the future)

@mtfk - who do you see fetching the dynamic data - the Holder/Prover or the Verifier?  I think it would have to be the Holder/Prover, and that the data would be signed by the Issuer using the DID associated with the Credential Definition.  I don't think the Verifier could get it directly, since there would not be a way to prevent the Verifier from sharing (without consent) the endpoint. If the Holder/Prover, why not just get an updated Credential with the latest info?

Alternatively does it make sense to just have this handled at the Agent-to-Agent message level vs. in the proof process?  E.g. do overlays bring value to this?  Alternatively, specifically add this to the proof process a

Separate observation: It seems like the concept here is tightly tied to the Issuer and hence the Credential Definition vs an Overlay. Perhaps a Credential Definition should have an optional Overlay included with it for handling these situations that are clearly Issuer-specific.  Non-Issuer specific Overlays would be used for more cross-cutting concerns - e.g. language translations, conditional handling, etc.

One way for the Verifier to get the data directly from the Issuer without risk of them sharing endpoint access would be for the Holder/Prover (e.g. the Customer of the Credit Union in Darrell's case) to issue a Verifiable Credential to the 3rd party to authorize them to get data from the Issuer.  This is a form of the Delegation of Authority pattern that we think will be very common in the future.

This new data architecture allows maximum flexibility so we might be able to utilise Overlays on top of other data structures, not just Schemas.

I don't mean an Overlay on top of Cred Def - rather that an Issuer could specify a Schema Overlay as part of a Cred Def where there was a desire for the Issuer to be able to count on the use of an Overlay, vs. it being up to the Prover/Holder or Verifier to use Overlays.

Of course your argument is valid that the credential could be updated and new credential could be issued. If that is the case then schema&overlays probably won't play any role here (maybe except being use to prepare claim in first place). But for data which changes regularly like bank account balance, heartbeat or any continues stream of information sounds like overkill. I am not sure if my way of thinking about those stuff is correct but this how I would see it:
* User need to share information about his bank account to Third party company. He request from the bank that he would like to receive verifiable credential that he is their customer (MemberSince, InstitutionName - static fields) and that his AvarageBalance (dynamic fields) over months is always positive. 
* Bank pull out schema (did:sov:1234) representing that verifiable credentials (here schema&overlays could come handy since they could have one schema with multiple overlays for different customers)
* Bank issue verifiable credential 
* Now user login to Third Party company  from where he received request to prove that his DID holds credential for schema (did:sov:1234) which is backed by bank. My understanding that the verifiable credential could be stored in agent or in bank directly where each time could be amended/updated for dynamic data, but it could be also stored within my Digital Wallet where can not be updated. But if we would use schema&overlays I could receive the request in my digital wallet where claim is stored and prove that without looking up anywhere. For example with ZKP I could prove that I own claim that I am a member of a bank longer then one year, with AvarageBalance - positive for last few months. Since everything would be tied to schema each piece of information can be proven (even those dynamic one - as we can trust the source of the data and by whom it would be signed)  
 
Not sure if I am not over engineering anything here but putting schema&overlays as a universal language to talk about structure of data seems very handy when  schema&overlays are identify via DID and stored in immutable storage. This gives possibility to make sure that the communication is easier and much secure within decentralize ecosystem.

We’re starting to get new use cases from members of the Hyperledger Indy community so, regarding the format of the biweekly *Semantics WG* calls, I thought we could concentrate on (i.) 1 x *advanced model presentation* (15 mins) and (ii.) 1 x *new use case* with input from the Schemas/Overlays team (approx. 10-15 mins) and the Verifiable Credentials team (approx. 10-15 mins). The 2nd of these items would be a 30 minute brainstorming session. When an advanced model presentation is not on the agenda, we may try to tackle two new use cases per call. I also think that we should increase the duration of these calls by 15 minutes (from 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes) so that we’re not pressed for time. Any further input regarding the format of these calls is most welcome.

After reflecting on the notion of dynamic data, I am very uncomfortable with the idea of a holder granting a verifier access to the issuer. This is a bad idea.
The holder would no longer be in control of what data the verifier may receive. This subverts self-sovereign identity.
Live access is not necessary, if a credential is no longer valid, the issuer should revoke it. 
I've seen descriptions of this where the access token provided by the holder to the verifier contains the holder's DID that is pairwise with the issuer. This completely negates any correlation and issuer-holder collusion protection the pairwise DID is supposed to provide. 
Even the capacity of the holder to revoke the verifier's access to the issuer is a matter of trusting the issuer.
This feels like it's going in the opposite direction we want, with the verifier and issuer retaining more control over the holder's data, and the verifier getting even more of the holder's data than was possible before. 
Instead of a holder having control of his data independent of the issuer, and selectively disclosing it to whichever verifiers he wishes, this notion provides more control to the issuer, who will see every verifier that comes along and know exactly what data they've retrieved. The whole idea that the holder has a different "identity" with the issuer than he has with the verifier is completely lost here.
The worst part is that this new anti-pattern of over sharing comes with the "consent" of the holder.

Going back to the credit union use case outlined by @darrell.odonnell , the individual is not an actor in the transaction. We need a verifiable credential that contains four variables, two static (MemberSince, InstitutionName) and two dynamic (AverageMonthlyBalance, GoodCustomerStanding). In this particular case, as these data points have been algorithmically generated by the credit union [CU1], they are the “Holder” and the “Verifier” of that data. The “Issuer” might be another credit union [CU2] who would be requesting verified data from the first credit union [CU1]. 

So …

CU2 issues a schema to CU1 containing … 

MemberSince
InstitutionName
AverageMonthlyBalance
GoodCustomerStanding

CU1 (with their “Holder” hat on) determines whether or not they are happy to share that data and, if so, (with their “Verifier” hat on) sends the Verifiable Credential to CU2.

Going back to the Dynamic Overlay suggestion by @mtfk , the overlay (specifying DID references to the two dynamic variables) would go on top of the credential not the schema.

Does that seem reasonable?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 05:52:11 GMT):<br/>
@pknowles - I'm really confused. That does not make sense to me at all.  How about we take this to a Google Doc and use that as a forum to make progress.  Among the pieces that don't make sense - the concept of issuing a schema, and that it appears to be two Credit Unions exchanging data about a  customer without the customer involved?   That definitely doesn't see right.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 05:58:50 GMT):<br/>
@brentzundel - I think there may be use cases where the volume and frequency of data precludes the use of all data flowing from the Issuer to the Holder to the Verifier. The @darrell.odonnell example is one that is fine (monthly updates, two aggregate data values - monthly VerCred issuances). However, what about the case of Mint or QuickBooks services getting a feed of all bank account transactions for the client?  I think that is one where the flow would be challenging.  Again - it might be OK, but for a big organization with many transactions - it's tricky.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 06:17:19 GMT):<br/>
@brentzundel - I think there may be use cases where varying from the strict - Issuer to Holder to Verifier data flow may be useful. In @darrell.odonnell's case, perhaps not - it's just two values monthly, so a Verifiable Credential is fine. But look at the case of services like Mint and QuickBooks that need near-real time access to all bank account transactions?  The volume increases with IoT devices.  Does the pure Verifiable Creds flow model always work for those?

In that case (Bank, Client, Service), I had thought a model like this might work (which I think is what @harrihoo did - I haven't reread his paper though).

- the Bank gives the Client a unique token (a capability) in a verifiable credential
- the Client issues a Verifiable Credential to the Service with that token
- the Service proves that token to the Bank each time it requests data (including proving non-revocation).
- Aside - on first use, the Bank might confirm with the Client if there were possibilities of a Verifier sharing the token - not sure on the tech there.
- the Bank sends non-verifiable credential data (but likely signs the data) to the Service.
- the Client can revoke the VerfCred sent to the Service at any time.

The "pure VC" alternative is that same setup is done with VerfCreds and automated processing by the SSI Agents from the Bank -> Client -> Service, but the net effect is the same - the Client only gets involved when they want to change the automation - e.g. cut off the Service. The challenge with this approach is that there is a lot more overhead involved - lots of asynch communications.  This might be the way to go, but at this stage, that seems more challenging.
</p>
<p><strong>pknowles</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 07:37:05 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran @brentzundel I do think we should figure out a one-size-fits-all model re dynamic data so that we have some solid guidelines to follow. Let me go through @harrihoo 's model in more detail and then we can start a Google Doc. It may be a two stage process to get consent from the customer in the first instance. Once that consent is given, I stand by my logic.

<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Fri, 07 Dec 2018 06:34:25 GMT):<br/>
Guys, FYI, @peacekeeper and the OASIS XDI Technical Committee members ran into this same pattern several years ago, just using different terminology. I think it's fairly common for a Verifier, when offering some service to a Holder, to want to establish a subscription to some data (or a proof of some data) about the Holder from an Issuer (bank balance being an example). At a high level there are two basic patterns:

1) *Direct Connection.* The Holder uses a VC to authorize a new direct connection between the Verifier and the Issuer. Done right, this connection has it's own pairwise pseudonymous DIDs between the Verifier and Issuer that are NOT the same as the pairs the Holder has with the Verifier and Issuer, respectively. So privacy can still be preserved. The Holder continues to control authorization of this connection for as long as the Holder wants the Verifier to have it (and the Issuer supports it). And this direct connection can either pull or push updates to the claim values.

2) *Proxy Connection*. The Holder uses a VC to authorize the Verifier to dynamically request the current claim value (e.g., a bank balance) from the Holder's cloud agent, who in turn proxies that request from the Holder directly back to the Issuer. The Issuer issues the updated claim value to the Holder's cloud agent, who then responds with the proof to the Veriifer. No additional pairwise pseudonymous DIDs need to be issued or shared; all privacy is preserved; and the Verifier now effectively has a pull-based subscription to the claim value. This same scenario can be set up for push as well. But for the proof to flow automatically, the Holder has to trust its cloud agent to produce the proof.

Thanks, @drummondreed ! That's super helpful. During our week in Basel, @mtfk and I will hash out a design to deal with dynamic variables using consent and dynamic overlays on credentials and/or schemas. Once we're close, I'll run it by experts like you, @swcurran , etc. for valued opinions.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 07 Dec 2018 08:06:11 GMT):<br/>
That makes sense, @drummondreed - thanks for the overview.  Sounds like we are in sync.  We'll chat in Basel!

<p><strong>anttikettunen</strong> (Fri, 07 Dec 2018 08:09:30 GMT):<br/>
@pknowles & @swcurran et al. I'm also interested in joining this discussion. Our team (Tieto) did the company identity project (aka Mercury) which also did a very quick-n-dirty VC-solution, similar to what @harrihoo did. I also now have few cases on the table where different types of consent models and "key verification without connection" -pattern is needed. 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 07 Dec 2018 08:10:48 GMT):<br/>
@anttikettunen - if you are going to Basel, we can discuss there. If online (and perhaps as well) - perhaps create a google doc outlining the parameters of the use case?
</p>
<p><strong>anttikettunen</strong> (Fri, 07 Dec 2018 08:11:31 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, a doc would be good, as I'm unlikely to be in Basel due to multiple deadlines at work before holiday season... :(

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-semantics?msg=ehFfM6tTZiDGDvtDM) @swcurran In order for the Client to issue the verifiable credential (and have the ability to revoke it) it would need a DID on the ledger, and right now the plan is to not put DIDs on the ledger for pairwise connections. I'm think that requiring a bank account holder to become a public entity in order to enable a service live access to that holder's account is a bad idea. 
But that is beside the point, allowing a service live access to my personal data is already a bad idea, unless a way can be come up with that gives the holder complete control. Granting live access to my personal data is an anti-pattern. 
None of the suggested protocols I've seen seem to fit with the stated principles of self-sovereign identity, so from my perspective, the answer to the question, "can Sovrin support this use case?" is, "No"

I have created a HIPE proposal that explains the theory and conventions associated with A2A decorators. As I was discussing with @pknowles yesterday, decorators have a huge amount in common with the notion of overlays, but I hadn't realized it until yesterday.

@darrell.odonnell Re dynamic variables, in our model, there is no such thing as dynamic. As a similar analogy, think of an analog wave form as a non-interpolated stream and a digitised version and an interpolated stream of data. In your use case re dynamic data, you can either tackle it from the Issuer side in a *collectionFrequency* attribute in a linked *Consent Schema* or you can put a *Source Overlay* on that attribute to point to an external dynamic variable. In both cases, we're dealing with interpolation which means you're covered from a "schemas and data capture" perspective. I need to better understand your use case in the Issuer, Holder, Verifier model. If I haven't answered your question, I'll look at it from a "claims and credentials perspective. In any case, it's certainly not going to be an issue.

In your use case re dynamic data, you can either tackle it from the Issuer side in a *collectionFrequency* attribute in a linked *Consent Schema* or you can put a *Source Overlay* on that attribute to point to an external dynamic variable. In both cases, we're dealing with interpolation which means you're covered from a "schemas and data capture" perspective. I need to better understand your use case in the Issuer, Holder, Verifier model. If I haven't answered your question, I'll look at it from a "claims and credentials perspective. In any case, it's certainly not going to be an issue.

@pknowles - I'm not sure there is any need for either a consent schema or an overlay for @darrell.odonnell's scenario.   The way that I understood we had agreed was that we would just use the normal - issuer/holder/verifier model, but the difference would be the automation of the claim flow to avoid constant manual intervention.  Assuming each party has an configurable, automated (Cloud) Agent, likely flow (but others are possible) is the following:

* The Verifier (Third Party) requests a periodic credential from the Holder (CU Customer)
* The Holder requests a Proof from the Issuer (CU)
* The Holder Proves the Claims from the Proof

All three are automated, and if any of the three want to stop the flow of data - they just stop their Agent from participating.  Of course, any of the three (and in particular - the CU Customer) could choose to not automate the process and get pinged for consent on every iteration.

With the agent infrastructure in place (which isn't available yet....), I think this can be done without any extra magic.  Frequency would like be handled as part of the Agent Message Family used to setup the automated process.

BTW, @mtfk and I cracked the Overlays data architecture model early yesterday morning. The HIPE will be going in within the next couple of days for review. A couple of important pieces that we will be subsequently looking at are: (i.) a _pii_attributes_ *schema object* to allow the issuer to flag sensitive data according to the *Blinding Identity Taxonomy (BIT)* as we start to onboard. That is the Issuer's tool for flagging sensitive schema elements. On the Holder side, sensitive data can be screened courtesy of a sensitive overlay which is not tied to a particular schema base but rather to a sensitive data repository held off-ledger. (ii.) The second interesting piece will be determining the exact elements defined in a consent schema which can then be coupled with any schema. The exact elements will be determined according to GDPR requirements along with those necessary for @janl 's consent receipt model to work. [ref. https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/55 ]. Things are starting to get very interesting. Seeing the pieces align between the "schemas and data capture" team and the "claims and credentials" team will be awesome to see.

I've been heavily researching *industry classification standards* for the past 14 months and have finally settled on a proposed implementation solution to better improve data object indexing and searchability within the Hyperledger Indy ecosystem. My proposal is to utilise two publicly available classification standards for: (i.) *Global Industries* and (ii.) *New Economies*. I've stored the two ontologies, *GICS* (Global Industry Classification Standard) and *NECS* (New Economy Classification Standard) in the following HL Indy shared area. This topic will be further discussed during the Semantics WG call on January 8th. https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1uRBKIPT1DA838wTGStYhfj0CKqBKq1rV?ogsrc=32

Following valuable input from @danielhardman, I've started early work on a *data consent schema* build proposal detailing the necessary attributes required for data retention/revocation transactions as described in @janl 's _Consent Receipt model_ [https://github.com/JanLin/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/consent_receipt] or that a person might rightly impose before they are willing to give consent for the use of requested data. I've stored the early drafts in the following HL Indy shared area. This topic will be further discussed during the Semantics WG call on January 8th. https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1FFU47tCTu7XbNnpD2oZlbgglrKiTh5yb?ogsrc=32

As of late last night, a couple of new elements have been added to the *Blinding Identity Taxonomy (BIT)*. Updated version via link. https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1gSD1b70OySIUKNOQTSbQ7khq9oy1V8UP?ogsrc=32

Following initial review from @TomWeiss (Thanks, Tom!), we've added a new compulsory free form text attribute into the *Data Consent schema base* called (for want of a better name) `Use-Case-Description`. The point here is that legally when we share our _PII_ we are only sharing it for specific use cases. _PII_ can't be shared with consent for "all use cases", only for specific ones. Under GDPR, consumers have to explicitly opt-in to each use case. It's a key part of consent. If we're clever, we might be able to do some machine learning on that free form text attribute to help categorise use cases in an upgraded version further down the road. For now, it certainly addresses the issue without overcomplicating. Updated version via link. https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1FFU47tCTu7XbNnpD2oZlbgglrKiTh5yb?ogsrc=32

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-semantics?msg=n8Fe2YBZqjmfp62ip) I just received the following message from @apoikola on the MyData Slack channel. Jogi's suggestions are always well thought through so we should consider the following comment during Tuesday's WG meeting … 

"The name of Kantara’s group ”Consent *and* Information Sharing” has two sides. My practical understanding is that consent as *one of the legal bases* for data prosessing under GDPR is not very popular, organisations do everything possible to avoid consent.

*1#* One strategy is: ”let’s make consent so easy and smooth so that it becomes more popular”.

*2#* Other strategy would be to cover all legal bases in wider information sharing framework and hope that transparency and individual’s control over their data can be achieved also in cases when consent is not used.

Personally I used to be proponent on nr. 1, but lately I have been shifting more towards 2.

Therefore my suggestion would be to make the schema ”legal base agnostic” technical means to capture the attributes and conditions related to data sharing."

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-semantics?msg=gvbAB54ayFjaJsSN4) @pknowles In the Kantara CIS WG our currently-published spec is the "Consent Receipt" for a variety historical of reasons. We are making the transition towards a more general "Receipt for Personal Data Processing" which captures record-keeping details for the service provider to keep and also for the individual to keep (if they wish) - and will be applicable to any of the GDPR legal basis categories. So we are all lined up to do #2 while already covering #! (or, at least all the 'consent management' product companies are covering  it) 
</p>
<p><strong>pknowles</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 02:46:06 GMT):<br/>
@AndrewHughes3000 I prefer the wording - "Receipt for Personal Data Processing". I was just expressing to @mwherman2000 that a number of startups had tended towards data reclusion rather than adopting a more sensible approach to data sharing. "Consent Receipt" sounds like one of terms borne out of that reclusive mindset. "Receipt for Personal Data Processing" feels much more sociable! On that note, I'd be inclined to change the name of the current *data consent schema* to *PDP schema* (something along those lines anyway). Let's bring this point up in today's Semantics WG.

Following a brief discussion during Tuesday's *Semantics WG* call regarding the original *data consent schema* proposal to capture legally required attributes related to _data consent_ and the subsequent *PDP*  _[Personal Data Processing]_ *schema* to capture attributes used to define a window of access for the intended data share, we're going to prioritise the latter. The data capture provided by the *PDP schema* will allow algorithmic processes to be constructed so that data can be automatically revoked once the defined access window has been closed. It is not intended to be a construct for legal consent terms. We'll deep dive this topic on Tuesday, January 22nd during the next Semantics call.

The next *Indy Semantics WG* call is this coming Tuesday, February 19th @ 11am-12.15pm MT / 7pm-8.15pm CET

If you're planning to join the call, there is a bit of homework/research to be done beforehand ...  

Following a number of calls with the technical team at *digi.me*, they're keen to investigate the possibility of integrating some of their core functionality with Hyperledger Indy. I have an integration review call with their tech team later this month and a Blockchain interoperability feasibility study site meeting in early March. For those of you in the *MyData* space, you’ll know that this could be a potentially powerful collaboration of technologies and mindsets. I’m keen to help facilitate these discussions. For an initial soft integration, I propose to approach this from a semantics perspective and then, if deemed appropriate, to delve deeper into the stack on an _as needed_ basis.

For any Indy community members planning to dial into next week’s semantics call, check out the following two links beforehand to better understand digi.me's backend services ...   

(i.) A four part series ending with how digi.me do consent - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsg6XlZAq3AJVp_439UzcMkg7Pdakzw-9
(ii.) A further drill down at developers.digi.me 

During Tuesday night's semantics call, we’ll be discussing …

1.  Taking a code fragment that would allow digi.me backend to support 3 primary functions …

     *   Init connection (with appropriate credentials)
     *   Write block of data representing a Consent Access Receipt (according to some base CAR schema, topic, identity model)
     *   Read a block of Clinical Trial data according to the base Schema + (chosen) Overlay
  
2.  Discussion on lowering the bar for digi.me team to perform integration

     *   They seek a fast track to demo implementation to release funding

3.  Share digi.me view of how multiple overlays work and how they could normalise to a master ontology to support N x N interoperability

     *   Concepts
     *   Toolchain example

4.  Constructing a mini Hyperledger Indy development team for potential interwork including a public demo

Have a fabulous weekend!!!

@all The next *Indy Semantics WG* call is this coming Tuesday, February 19th @ 11am-12.15pm MT / 7pm-8.15pm CET

If you're planning to join the call, there is a bit of homework/research to be done beforehand ...  

Following a number of calls with the technical team at *digi.me*, they're keen to investigate the possibility of integrating some of their core functionality with Hyperledger Indy. I have an integration review call with their tech team later this month and a Blockchain interoperability feasibility study site meeting in early March. For those of you in the *MyData* space [https://mydata.org ], you’ll know that this could be a potentially powerful collaboration of technologies and minds. I’m keen to help facilitate these discussions. For an initial soft integration, I propose to approach this from a semantics perspective and then, if deemed appropriate, to delve deeper into the stack on an _as needed_ basis.

For any Indy community members planning to dial into next week’s semantics call, check out the following two links beforehand to better understand digi.me's backend services ...   

(i.) A four part series ending with how digi.me do consent - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsg6XlZAq3AJVp_439UzcMkg7Pdakzw-9
(ii.) A further drill down at developers.digi.me 

During Tuesday night's semantics call, we’ll be discussing …

@mwherman2000 - I'll colour-coordinate the images in the latest *Overlays data capture architecture* deck to align with the Tech / App / Bus layers as defined. I envisage those images being used in various future HIPEs so it makes sense to get the colours to line up with the layers in the rest of your ARM work. Thanks, Michael.

I documented the Principles I used to guide the creation of the Overlays ARM diagram: https://github.com/mwherman2000/indy-arm/blob/master/README.md#principles
</p>
<p><strong>pknowles</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 04:49:09 GMT):<br/>
@mwherman2000 - The following 7 overlays have been defined for "Issuer” use ...

*Source Overlay* => to point to an external source of predefined Schema attribute definitions (e.g. HL7 FHIR, Schema 2.0, etc.);

*Encode Overlay* => to define character encoding (e.g. UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, Windows-1251, Base58Check, etc.);

*Entry Overlay* => to add predefined field values to Schema attributes;

*Label Overlay* => to add labels to Schema attributes (incl. category labels);

*Format Overlay* => to add formats (incl. field lengths) to Schema attributes;

*Conditional Overlay* => to add simple conditional programming within a Schema;

*Subset Overlay* => to create a Schema subset
</p>
<p><strong>pknowles</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 04:51:54 GMT):<br/>
The only overlay defined for “Holder” use is ...

*Sensitive Overlay* => to enable a Holder to flag user-defined sensitive attributes
</p>
<p><strong>pknowles</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 04:54:52 GMT):<br/>
[Note that the _Sensitive Overlay_ is the only one not linked to a specific _Schema Base_ but rather to a _Data Vault_ within the Holder's personal device.]

While building the tool didn't thought much about semantics yet just copy pasted what had around but as soo  as from feature point of view will have correct flow we can review one by one and kick out those which are  ot needed.
</p>
<p><strong>pknowles</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 07:21:09 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-semantics?msg=a08a324e-8d4a-4611-89be-aed60a0b7dc9) @mtfk I think we've done that already.
</p>
<p><strong>pknowles</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 08:17:13 GMT):<br/>
@mwherman2000 @mtfk - Looking at the Overlays ARM schematic, we may be able to remove the Business Layer from the card stack. Perhaps a description of the flow might shed some light on my thinking here. As I see it, the process of using Robert's middleware tool from an Ïssuer's point of view would go something like ... 

(i.) According to the GICS / NECS ontologies [ https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1uRBKIPT1DA838wTGStYhfj0CKqBKq1rV ], the Issuer would tag the current Schema building process with the lowest level GICS and/or NECS industry codes. These tags can be used for searchability purposes further downstream.; 

(ii.) The Issuer then builds a plethora of pre-publish schema(s) incl. _Technology Layer_ and _Application Layer_ overlays.; 

(iii.) The Issuer then hits a "Publish" button but, before the schemas are published, the build process for the _Business_ schemas (i.e. consent-related schemas) is triggered. The Schema build process for these Business schemas will allow the same level of overlay flexibility but I envisage the Schema Bases to already be locked in courtesy of an Issuer such as Kantara Initiative. The 3 consent-related schema constructs that we are/will be working on are a *PDP* (Personal Data Processing) schema, a *Generic Consent* schema and a *Specialized Consent* schema. Elements from each of these 3 constructs will ultimately be used to populate a standardized Consent Receipt (Kantara Initiative). Once the Issuer has defined these consent-related constructs, the entire suite of completed Schemas (i.e.  the "plethora of pre-publish schema(s)" mentioned in point (i.)) can be published. 

More information on the _PDP schema_ ... https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1FFU47tCTu7XbNnpD2oZlbgglrKiTh5yb

These _Business Layer_ constructs would basically act as a wrapper encompassing the suite of Schemas to be published. Think of these constructs as containing metadata to define consent for all schemas contained in a .ZIP file.
</p>
<p><strong>mwherman2000</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 13:46:34 GMT):<br/>
RE: Format Overlay* => to add formats (incl. field lengths) to Schema attributes;
Is this purpose of this overlay to:
a. control presentation the values of an attribute in the user experience? (Application layer)
b. storage/persistence of the values of an attribute? (Technology layer)
These are (usually) different.
</p>
<p><strong>mwherman2000</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 13:51:33 GMT):<br/>
@pknowles RE: Perhaps a description of the flow might shed some light on my thinking here. As I see it, the process of using Robert's middleware tool from an Ïssuer's point of view would go something like ... 
We need to separate the "how" from the "what".  The process you described is the "how" but the card stack diagram is intended to be a description of the "what" ...the architecture of the Overlay card stack.  There is an interplay between the two but they are different.

This is consistent with the card stack model - the Application Layer is supposed to support needs of the Business layer.  ...or alternatively, the business layer is an overarching concept for what appears in the Application and Technology layers.

@mtfk @brentzundel @kenebert @jan With the *Rich Schema* efforts gaining some focus now, I believe that it'll be hugely valuable for Ken and Brent to see the _under-the-hood_ code being dynamically constructed by the *ODCA middleware tool*. Although Robert and I have been concentrating on the initial schema creation process up until this point, it's fairly obvious to me that a few minor additions to the tool will also enable credential schema issuance. Some of the HL Indy stack processes will be difficult to digest for people less technically minded and new to the community and I strongly believe that we can create this great piece of middleware tooling to help organisations and individuals better adopt. The ODCA tool will always be open source, free to use and without IP. Robert can you suggest a good time for a closed demo/discussion with Ken and Brent so that we can ensure that everyone is pulling in the same direction? [Cc: @nage ]

@pknowles: I'm a fellow at the Insight Decentralized Consensus program here in San Francisco.  I caught the SSI bug last year at IIW and even though I was new to the concept of DIDs I caught your (or someone else's) session on Overlays.  The idea behind the Insight program is that we spend ~4 weeks working on a project and then demo it to potential employers at the end of the program.  I'm really interested in carving out SSI as my niche in this space, and it feels like overlays could be a really big deal, so I was hoping that you might be able to point me to some aspect of the problem that I might be able to contribute something to.  What would be the first step towards implementing overlays on a different blockchain - like Ethereum for instance.  Or, following from your March 20th post, is there some way that I could help create some high level tools to make ODCA accessible to the less technically minded?

@pknowles I think such a review would be useful. Please arrange a meeting.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-semantics?msg=usxsDbDbT9ZiLfn7C) @phoniks Thanks for reaching out. Although the initial implementation for the *ODCA middleware tool* is closely affiliated to _Hyperledger Indy_, the architecture is platform agnostic. In this new user-centric data economy that we are all striving to build, the OCDA architecture encourages both interoperability and reusability of data objects [_schema bases_ (base objects) and _overlays_] in an open economy. As all overlays contain their own ID, a link ID to a base object and industry sector tags, they become searchable either in a repository or on a ledger. By tracking the number times that the data objects are being utilised, the community of schema issuers effectively drive standardisation. We've started building the ODCA middleware tool in Dativa's innovation hub [https://www.dativa.com/innovation-hub/ ]. This is ultimately the project tool that I hope I can persuade you to work on in collaboration with us with a view to demoing it to potential employers. The code is totally open source. Nobody has any IP on it. Github repository - https://github.com/THCLab/tool . Further reading: https://www.dativa.com/introducing-overlays-data-capture-architecture/ . Let's continue this discussion on a Zoom call. I'll set that up with you directly. [Cc: @mtfk ]

Although the initial implementation for the *ODCA middleware tool* is closely affiliated to _Hyperledger Indy_, the architecture is platform agnostic. In this new user-centric data economy that we are all striving to build, the architecture encourages both interoperability and reusability of data objects [_schema bases_ (base objects) and _overlays_] in an open economy. As all overlays contain their own ID, a link ID to a base object and industry sector tags, they become searchable either in a repository or on a ledger. By tracking the number times that the data objects are being utilised, the community of schema issuers effectively drive standardisation. We've started building the ODCA middleware tool in Dativa's innovation hub [https://www.dativa.com/innovation-hub/ ]. This is ultimately the project tool that I hope I can persuade you to work on in collaboration with us with a view to demoing it to potential employers. The code is totally open source. Nobody has any IP on it. Github repository - https://github.com/THCLab/tool . Further reading: https://www.dativa.com/introducing-overlays-data-capture-architecture/ .

hi all! After 4 months study Hyperledger Fabric - now we win a project require Indy :).
Stick with Indy today I found some awesome tools to make a testnet.
My question is! Does Indy offer a public network and smart contract engine so that I can deploy smart contract to the network and call API from client?

From @drummondreed : Paul, on this whole subject of addressing immutable content objects (like schema definitions) with DIDs, see the current state-of-play about how this will be done in the DID spec in these two Google docs. The first one describes the matrix parameters proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TctFY8euBH2wq7Z8c9KccICDZUGZplvhoqlHlFMahGk/edit?usp=sharing

The second one is for contributors to write up their own use cases for DID URLs in the 3 syntaxes under consideration. Should only take any W3C Credentials Community Group member 5 mins to write up your own examples: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VpYPvUw2o-01e727bCy2V-0MUEe0_NB-EqX677scQbI/edit?usp=sharing

A bit off topic but does anyone have a schema definition for a DID Document? ...that is, a meta description/definition outlining the overall structure of a DID Document, the mandatory elements, provisions for optional elements, ...that sort of thing.Effectively, the spec text for a DID Document from the DID Spec (https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#did-documents) expressing in some sort of schema definition language (e.g. JSON schema?)

@mtfk I'm looking forward to your talk.  The primary goal of the Hyperonomy Universal Decentralized Identifier URI Specification, its reason for being, is specifically to support every possible application of DIDs on the planet ...quite literally and demonstrably.  A key feature is the concept of Domain-Specific DID Grammar (DSDG).

We moved tool presenting ODCA concept from github into bitbucket where we would continue work. We already created tickets there to let others contribute and follow the progress. if you have any wishes or ideas for features or issues please feel free to create new ticket or drop us message here.

The bitbucket would allow us to connect repo to pipelines and soon the tool should be available under domain where people can take a look on the tool without need to fetch the code. 

Stay tuned!

@mtfk  I'm super excited to tackle the IPFS integration!  Can you explain a bit more this concept of the DRI being used to access different layers? I think example would be particularly helpful for me.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Fri, 26 Apr 2019 04:14:47 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-semantics?msg=9sLHA3TuSizAKXWMp) @phoniks I would suggest to start here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VslH6Wy4WQbGzZ1uAcWFWE1mpkq03drP 
I talked about that concept on one of our calls. Basically DRI could be implement in different ways for example magnet link is pretty good one. CID and multihash is as well quite good. The idea of DRI to have it cross network and not only IPFS or swarm. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Fri, 26 Apr 2019 04:15:57 GMT):<br/>
Another approach would be to use DID and latest spec with content id. the spec is still in progress but sound like it could fit into our vision of DRI 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Fri, 26 Apr 2019 04:16:25 GMT):<br/>
For know to keep it simple IPFS sounds like a good shoot to try it out. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Fri, 26 Apr 2019 04:16:58 GMT):<br/>
so we need simple JS API which allow us to publish and fetch JSON-LD files ( and structures) to/from IPFS
</p>

Here you would find some materials: https://github.com/THCLab/DRI/

@VipinB [cont. from #indy channel] A schema base provides a standard base from which to decentralize data and, as such, all PII attributes have to be flagged in that base object. If, for example, an issuer were to publish a schema base having failed to flag a PII attribute, a new version would have to be created in order to flag that attribute as sensitive and that new version would inevitably become the standard. In other words, that refinement would not be done via an overlay. Other than that, you're spot on. Attribute names and types from a referenced source such as schema.org can be embedded into a schema base. I'd love to see schema.org flagging PII attributes at their end but that might be a tough sell. In any case, the PII schema object will remain an integral part of schema base functionality. There are also some neat catches that we can provide to a schema issuer. For instance, you'll notice that "Free-Form Text Fields / Unstructured Data" is a BIT element. That allows us to apply some deep logic in the foundational code to warn the issuer of any attributes that will be treated as unstructured data fields prior to publishing. Here, if an attribute has a data type of "Text" defined in the schema base and a linked entry overlay has not been used to add predefined field values to that attribute, it would be treated as a "Free-Form Text Field" and subsequently flagged as a PII attribute. If we were to let that slide, there would be a privacy risk as an end user would be able to potentially enter PII information into that text field (I reckon a "Ban all free-form text fields!" working group would be oversubscribed! 🙂). Although there is nothing stopping a schema issuer from publishing a schema base as a stand alone object, I would strongly advocate that, at the very least, an entry overlay be constructed to accompany that object at the time of initial publish.

@pknowles are there any implementations of this? Or is it just a proposal? The BIT comes from the Kanatara Initiative? Are there known schemas currently used in the Enterprise for Identity capture, Authentication, Authorization other than what comes from Schema.org (Person) that refer to those PII-Attributes?  Do you have any references for these? Thanks for moving discussion here.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-semantics?msg=zPDg4Fi3YGBG5vfYa) @VipinB We performed a command line "Overlays" demo at IIW back in May 2018 to some great feedback. Following detailed input from the Hyperledger Indy Semantics WG and the Hyperledger Technical Ambassadors, we are now in the process of developing the ODCA middleware tooling in the Dativa Innovation Hub [ https://www.dativa.com/innovation-hub/ ]. The final tool will be white labelled, open source, free to use with no IP. It looks like we'll be working with Roche Pharmaceuticals and Roche Diagnostics for the the first two pilots. We're also applying for grants to help fund the ODCA initiative. It feels like we're beyond the conceptual phase now and into the early pilot phase although there is still a lot of coding to be done. I spearheaded the BIT initiative following lengthy discussions with Elizabeth Renieris at the same edition of IIW. The first version of the BIT was published in early September [ https://www.dativa.com/blinding-identity-taxonomy/ ] and, soon after, I donated it to Kantara Initiative. The latest version of the BIT is housed with the Consent & Information Sharing WG at Kantara Initiative as a work in progress. The BIT has remained stable for the past 3 months but it is not an official standard yet. Regarding Kantara, I'll check with @AndrewHughes3000 to see if they have (or know of any) schemas for Identity, Identity scoring, Identity capture, Authentication or Authorization that we could qualify using pii-attributes. I'll get back to you once I have an answer. In the meantime, here is a nice quote from Colin Wallis, Kantara's Executive Director, regarding the BIT: " _The BIT is one of those critical pieces of behind-the-scenes plumbing that is expected to fundamentally improve data protection of personal data as deployment rates in both traditional and distributed ledger technology (DLT) domains rise._ "

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sun, 28 Apr 2019 13:07:57 GMT):<br/>
@pknowles thanks for the detailed answer. I am poking around  https://bitbucket.org/dativa4data/odcatool/. Elizabeth Reneiris is a friend (at least I like to think so), and I have appreciated her clear thinking around privacy topics. I have also written on medium (https://medium.com/@vipinsun/security-privacy-in-the-age-of-surveillance-6a0fbeae97d4) on the subject of Privacy, more from a 4th Amendment point of view, but I look at some remedies (Combination Therapy) and appropriate technology is definitely one of the tools needed in Combination Therapy. I think BIT is very important- I assume you are going to be at this year's IIW.  I wont be there, but will be hosting Drummond and possibly Nathan on May 1st at the Hyperledger Identity Working Group call for a recap. #identity-wg ...  Looking forward to hearing from you. I  am reading some of the docs from Kantara Initiative on the topic as well. Any pointers on commonly used schemas (not just from kanatara) for Identity related work will be appreciated. We are writing a paper in HL IDWG on Identity and the Blockchain with specific reference to DLTs. As a cross-platform initiative, this is more like a survey of the field with references for a deeper dive targeted to generalists who are interested in Identity.

@mtfk  Are you suggesting that during Authorization, we do this decentralized surety (i.e. Authentication) every time we get granted. To be practical, we need some way to expose this to the relying party
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 17:33:37 GMT):<br/>
@mtfk  for mobile, you use the different phone only to contact the bad guy from a random address. The phone will be turned off with no battery during other times. 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 17:41:48 GMT):<br/>
@mtfk  fascinating thought experiment
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 17:48:05 GMT):<br/>
@mtfk accumulators. ZKP of that private data etc. can be used instead of granular
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 17:48:51 GMT):<br/>
Accumulators like you mentioned ....

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-semantics?msg=vAh5p2i7uqAmXh6ug) There is no need to do the whole process each time. You can imagine that you have to provide proofs (randomly choose by versifier) from yesterday, last week and 5 months ago. You digital wallet could store those proofs in a form of verifiable credentials of some sort. So it would be quite simple and fast process.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-semantics?msg=d3TQMRpRuawGuaNK2) @VipinB of course in that case would be hard to track it as there won't be correlation but if you calling to same guy all the time they can find out who is this guy (if he does not do as you do) if he does you have a problem of exchanging phone numbers anyway). But yes there are some cases where you could hide if you know how.

<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 18:56:17 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-semantics?msg=ZsXB7yH9Zuoi6EsTT) The point here is that more signals you have stronger identity you posses. - more trustworthy you are. That is where this decentralized identity comes handy as the artifacts are distributed quite well and you can be quite secure.

A note about the Hyperledger Aries launch, since this group spans ledger and protocol you may be wondering which project will host this effort.  Because Aries is ledger agnostic, it can support alternative data models, meaning this effort will stay inside Indy with effort in Aries for protocol support.  I expect it will stay an Indy effort and coordinate with Aries.
</p>
<p><strong>phoniks</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 15:19:11 GMT):<br/>
So, one of the most exciting things to come out of IIW this year was the 1st draft spec for a did:git method. The idea is basically to use the git repository as a source of truth about its contents, and its contributors. Interestingly, it also includes support for a governance file that would define the rules for how maintainers could be added, and how releases were issued (with multi sig).  Now, maybe I'm getting a bit ahead of myself - I'll admit to not fully understanding either overlays, or this DID method completely yet - but I wonder if anyone else sees this as an ideal way to manage overlays.  My thinking is that if a consortium of businesses wishes to maintain a common set of overlays they could decide on a governance scheme and then collectively manage a git repo using this method.  So I'm curious, do people see value in this application of the did:git method?  Is it the sort of thing that the ODCA tool should include? @mtfk - I'm particularly interested in your take.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-semantics?msg=BcE35DgAYbWG4nv5F) How are you planning to resolve DID on git? 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 19:37:06 GMT):<br/>
Another issue which could be problematical is that actually git is not immutable. You can easily override the history of the git and then you depend how many honest copies are on the network. Or you go "centralized" path and say that github account holding this repo is the only place of truth.  
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 19:38:13 GMT):<br/>
Of course the commit ID is immutable (almost impossible to get collision) but it means that if someone (even accidentally override the git history) you won't be able to resolve that specific commit anymore.  
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 19:40:37 GMT):<br/>
Because of above I would prefer solutions like IPFS and IPID for ODCA where you can create local swarm and connect everyone from consortium or just use public network to give access to anyone. 
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 19:42:01 GMT):<br/>
The only missing part of the IPID is the connection with verified identity which is publishing that bit of content. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 19:44:09 GMT):<br/>
This what for example sovrin offering or in git spec  --signoff feature. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 19:44:58 GMT):<br/>
There is interesting work done on DID spec where actually you could combine any did compatible method with CID like ipfs hash or magnet link 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 19:45:58 GMT):<br/>
Of course my favorite is DRI - decentralize resource identifier :) but not sure yet how this would be connected to verified identity. 
</p>
<p><strong>pknowles</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 20:04:30 GMT):<br/>
I've just published the *ODCA paper* on medium.com for public consumption - https://medium.com/@paul.knowles_52509/overlays-data-capture-architecture-odca-providing-a-standardized-global-solution-for-data-caeb1679137a
</p>
<p><strong>phoniks</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 18:57:16 GMT):<br/>
So the identity info is stored in-band. Essentially you'd have a `/repo/.git/dids` where you would store the DID docs.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 18:58:37 GMT):<br/>
but where is the repo? Is it on github? Is it on my private server? How people can find this repo if they do not have it? 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 18:59:10 GMT):<br/>
Currently if you want to share git with someone you need to give him access to the machine where it is (by hosting it or just give the access to the file system) 
</p>
<p><strong>phoniks</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:03:48 GMT):<br/>
I think it's good to be flexible. so maybe you have a private git server or maybe you host it on IPFS, or maybe you do host it on github.  
</p>
<p><strong>phoniks</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:05:28 GMT):<br/>
I think the tool could pretty easily accommodate any of  those options
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:07:02 GMT):<br/>
Yes but how the did would resolve to specific DID doc if you do not know my address but just commit ID ? 
</p>
<p><strong>phoniks</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:08:08 GMT):<br/>
ahhh, I see.  they're mapped in the dids directory
</p>
<p><strong>phoniks</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:08:28 GMT):<br/>
so you have a genesis commit
</p>
<p><strong>phoniks</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:08:40 GMT):<br/>
after which you treat the repo as immutable
</p>
<p><strong>phoniks</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:08:51 GMT):<br/>
and sign the commits according to your governance plan
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:08:54 GMT):<br/>
where this did directory is stored? 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:08:54 GMT):<br/>
where this did directory is stored/hosted? 
</p>
<p><strong>phoniks</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:10:12 GMT):<br/>
it's part of the repo itself.  So where ever you host your repo.
</p>
<p><strong>phoniks</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:11:15 GMT):<br/>
and the files are named as the PK of the DID
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:12:45 GMT):<br/>
ok another way here is example of the DID:
`did:git:abcde12345` Which I shared with you 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:12:50 GMT):<br/>
how you would get did document?
</p>
<p><strong>phoniks</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:18:14 GMT):<br/>
"The git did read operation will "resolve" the "id" by looking up the SHA1 hash of the commit that added the DID document to the repo and dynamically add the "id" member to what is rendered to the user."
</p>
<p><strong>phoniks</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:18:20 GMT):<br/>
from the spec
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:19:08 GMT):<br/>
Yes but how you would look up the SHA1 hash if you do not know where repo is?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:20:22 GMT):<br/>
for example if I have did:ipid:asdfgh1234 I know that I have to go to IPFS network and look up hash on the IPFS network 
if I have did:git:sha1 I have no idea where to check right? Or am I missing something?
</p>
<p><strong>phoniks</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:21:51 GMT):<br/>
No I'm sure I'm the one that's missing something haha
</p>
<p><strong>phoniks</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:23:28 GMT):<br/>

<br/><a href="./assets/4kPNRfrdgk65qm6gM-Screen Shot 2019-05-09 at 12.22.54 PM 1.png">Screen Shot 2019-05-09 at 12.22.54 PM 1.png</a>
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:24:07 GMT):<br/>
The idea of the DID spec is that when you adding new method it explain how the did can be resolved. So where to look it up to get the did document. 
Some methods basically points you to specific network on which you can resolve the hash form did to a did document. For `sov` is sovrin network for `ipid` is IPFS for uport is the string it self. 

The question is where I should look for this commit ID from `did:git` in order to get the did document 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:24:54 GMT):<br/>
In many cases I could create my own repository and host it but then only myself is able to resolve it as I know where the git is stored.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:25:13 GMT):<br/>
If I would like to share that repo with others I would need to share with them DID and the location of the repository 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:25:29 GMT):<br/>
which makes it quite centralized solution and error prone 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:25:47 GMT):<br/>
of course you could always choose github which is public repository which anybody can use to resolve it 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:26:00 GMT):<br/>
but then it should not be called `did:git` but `did:github` 
</p>
<p><strong>phoniks</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:26:37 GMT):<br/>
`did:github` exists I believe
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:27:45 GMT):<br/>
https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-registry/
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:27:50 GMT):<br/>
for sure not here 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:28:31 GMT):<br/>
of course git spec would make sens for some specific use cases like  company base did repository or something 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:28:43 GMT):<br/>
but this needs to be clear from the beginning how and where it is hosted 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:29:13 GMT):<br/>
because that way it won't be much different from DNS base one as you would always need to use some domains to point to the server 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:29:39 GMT):<br/>
you would just get extra features of git how to actually store and track did document 
</p>
<p><strong>phoniks</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:31:18 GMT):<br/>
Right, so the usecase I'm thinking of is a consortium where presumably you do agree on that in advance
</p>
<p><strong>phoniks</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:31:55 GMT):<br/>
and the benefit I think is the ability to add a lightweight governance mechanism to the management of shared overlays
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:38:07 GMT):<br/>
@dhuseby will be able to highlight this approach better when he's back from vacation. I believe the intent is to operate in a p2p fashion and would therefore not define a discovery mechanisms like other DID methods. This is similar to how the DID:peer method is working. A DID method is not required to be discoverable. As an example, a 10.0.* IP address is not globally resolvable. I can only discover it when I'm on a local network. Another example is if I host a local intranet domain and let my local DNS server handle the resolving I can discover it (which would likely resolve to a local IP). However, if I operate on a different network outside the local network, I cannot resolve the domain, and therefore cannot find the IP.
</p>
<p><strong>phoniks</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:41:33 GMT):<br/>
thanks.  I was just about to mention did peer, but that explanation is very illuminating, for me at least.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:58:26 GMT):<br/>
Even if you operate with p2p fashion you still need to define how to resolve it. If you assume that it is local repository or local ip, dns what ever it would be need to be part of the spec. The good example of resolution process is this what the guys from uport did with their DID. You can compose did document directly from the string within DID so you don't have to reach any server, place, location. Just build it from there. Of course it is very limiting but it shows how flexible did spec is. 

Here in case of p2p communication fashion you could do similar things all depends how you would like to design it.  If you assume that it is always localhost, would be fine as well. 

But this part needs to be clearly specify in the spec. Because if you assume that anyone can define their own location then it should be part of the DID (e.g. encoded within the string SHA1(SHA1+location) or something like that. Does that make any sense? 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 19:59:45 GMT):<br/>
And back to the main question if this would make sens for ODCA, it could if there is close repository of ODCA and nobody from outside can use it. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:01:25 GMT):<br/>
I always try to think about ODCA objects in a way that they have two properties:
- immutable (like ipfs hash)
- source verifiable (verify who issued it if I can trust it - like DID)  
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:01:27 GMT):<br/>
In the method spec it says "The git did read operation will "resolve" the "id" by looking up the SHA1 hash of the commit that added the DID document to the repo and dynamically add the "id" member to what is rendered to the user."
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:02:34 GMT):<br/>
Yep, how I could know where the repo is? Is it part of the spec somewhere? 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:03:06 GMT):<br/>
For example I could have multiple repositories (each for department) 
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:03:16 GMT):<br/>
No knowing the location is relevant to discovery. Knowing how to resolve is orthogonal. I do think resolution will require better detail though.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:04:42 GMT):<br/>
By that I mean, I can go through the resolution algorithm, but because I don't have access to the location of the DID Doc I cannot discover it.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:05:00 GMT):<br/>
Similar to how I can know the domain of the intranet domain, but not able to access the server.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:06:21 GMT):<br/>
You are right the resolution process is clearly defined. The question is how base on this description someone could implement it e.g. in Digital Wallet. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:07:00 GMT):<br/>
There would be good to have clear specification about the discovery process and how to transport information about it together with DID 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:07:00 GMT):<br/>
It would be good to have clear specification about the discovery process and how to transport information about it together with DID 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:07:00 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:08:56 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure discovery is relevant. Similar to how the peer did method spec doesn't specify how to cache, and lookup in cache to resolve a DID Doc.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:09:27 GMT):<br/>
It's up to the implementers to define these aspects I believe. @dhuseb
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:09:27 GMT):<br/>
It's up to the implementers to define these aspects I believe. @dhuseby may have other ideas though.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:11:05 GMT):<br/>
The closest the peer DID method spec comes to defining this is "by sending a state_request message from one peer to another"
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:11:40 GMT):<br/>
However this doesn't mean that if I send this message to a random server that they must send me back a DID Doc. The resolution would fail instead.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:12:04 GMT):<br/>
Similar to if I send a DNS request to a random web server, I shouldn't expect it to send a proper reply back.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:13:27 GMT):<br/>
Don't you think that leaving that part to the implementer won't introduce any problems? 

With my understanding is similar to the example where I could take `did:sov` and implement it in a way that it always resolve against my own test sovrin network. Means that if someone would take it would not be able to resolve it unless they use my implementation.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:14:19 GMT):<br/>
yeah that's how it works right now. This is with good intention, it allows for extensibility.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:17:05 GMT):<br/>
For example in a network of networks design, I may want to support many networks that have different DSTF. In this case, I would likely resolve to the genesis_txn_file I have on hand a gensis txn file for a specific network (defined as did:sov:network:id) and then I would resolve the ID from that specific network.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:18:45 GMT):<br/>
The only network I've heard that specifies to a specific ledger is the sidetree did method for BTC and that's so that it can specify to a certain fork. If another fork occurs, they plan to update which fork the method should resolve to.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:20:04 GMT):<br/>
So following that lead it could be something like 
did:git:SHA1?location=localhost
or 
did:git:SHA1?location=github.com/did/repo
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:20:24 GMT):<br/>
just skip the syntax as it is not correct probably with that what is so far used in the did spec
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:20:52 GMT):<br/>
the point is that did through params could help you out to find out where to look on it 
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:21:16 GMT):<br/>
I don't think specifying location is necessary. Rather I need to know which resolver to ask so that I can discover it.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:21:36 GMT):<br/>
By specifying to a specific location how do I know which localhost you're referring to?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:21:43 GMT):<br/>
as it my localhost or yours?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:22:47 GMT):<br/>
the point is that params helping you out to find it if that would be through resolver or direct path that could be open to the debate 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:23:15 GMT):<br/>
but you are right context is quite important as location does not work if you loose the location 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:23:15 GMT):<br/>
but you are right context is quite important as location does not work if you loose the context
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:23:46 GMT):<br/>
having just relative path should work as soon as you are aware of that you should have that git repo with you
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:24:02 GMT):<br/>
So you could imagine that within the company each digital wallet by default fetch did directory 
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:24:11 GMT):<br/>
We may store the exact same git repo locally, but that doesn't mean that my version is the same as your version. Just that they once were based on the same probabilistically. (I say that because sha1 isn't believe to be perfectly collision resistant anymore.)
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:24:13 GMT):<br/>
and then in p2p manner everyone can resolve each did within the company 
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:24:34 GMT):<br/>
yup, this is in line with what I'm thinking.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:24:59 GMT):<br/>
However it's not the location that's relevant. It's which resolver that you ask that is.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:25:23 GMT):<br/>
Similarly, if I live in China and type in a banned website it doesn't resolve.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:25:41 GMT):<br/>
That resolvablility isn
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:25:41 GMT):<br/>
That resolvability isn't because the domain doesn't exist, but rather because the dns doesn't have a record to resolve to an IP.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:26:57 GMT):<br/>
China may not be the best example because I think they ban on IP rather than dns lookup, but they may do both.
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:27:46 GMT):<br/>
yep, you are right, for me right now in my mind location = place where I can get what I need (in that case did doc) if that would be done through resolver mechanism or just pointing it directly either way should be fine. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:28:23 GMT):<br/>
For example you could host your git on IPFS :) and point to the ipfs://asd910jd912jd91jd192 d which would be ipns 
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:28:41 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, that nuance took me awhile to discover. Again Dave may have other thoughts about it, but this is how I've thought about it because it's how the peer method spec works.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:29:08 GMT):<br/>
yup, I actually like the idea of hosting git repos on ipfs too.
</p>
<p><strong>phoniks</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:31:26 GMT):<br/>
I think that's a pretty exciting possibility as well
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:33:24 GMT):<br/>
again instead of IPFS I would love to use something like DRI :) Which could support any decentralized storage but that another long discussion :) 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:33:49 GMT):<br/>
Guys in did spec WG discussion about content_id parameter which actually could server that purpose so maybe DID would have that build in automatically 
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:34:07 GMT):<br/>
I haven't heard of DRI. do you have a link to more details about this?
</p>
<p><strong>phoniks</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:34:13 GMT):<br/>
actually I'm curious about that. would you consider a DRI a type of multiaddress?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:36:14 GMT):<br/>
DRI is a Decentralized Resource Identifier - it is my attempt to address need to be able to use content identifiers across different decentralize networks (like swarm, ipfs, torrent etc..) similar what magnet link is doing with mutlihashes 
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:36:39 GMT):<br/>
Got a spec I can read?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:37:17 GMT):<br/>
There is presentation which I did recently on semantic call, let me fetch the link 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:38:10 GMT):<br/>
Here some materials with the deck which I used for presentation: https://github.com/THCLab/DRI/

</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:39:31 GMT):<br/>
and here the recording from the call 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:43:43 GMT):<br/>
and in the context did p2p I think you could be interested as well into ID proofing - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Deb8JZ0VoMpYqXMEWpRKomWYbADqp86j 

we are trying to work out on the new approach to the identity in truly decentralize manner by monitoring signals and impact within environment instead of looking on specific issued credentials. 
</p>
<p><strong>phoniks</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 21:31:35 GMT):<br/>
@mtfk can you draw a distinction between DRIs and multiaddresses?  https://multiformats.io/multiaddr/
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 21:43:26 GMT):<br/>
I would say that multiaddress sits layer above DRI, DRI is much more closer to the CID/Multihash from IPFS (if not same thing). basically DRI is just an attempt to trigger discussion how to solve problem of different content addresses formats. And important part here is that we are operating here only within the space of Content Base network. So we are looking for content not the location.  
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 21:45:12 GMT):<br/>
The idea is to have CID for each ODCA object which then can be served on multiple decentralized networks  which is not controlled by anyone. Same like with IPFS object as soon as there is someone willing to host the file it never disappear. It comes to this notion of UNIT of LANGUAGE. Which we discussed couple of times. Nobody should control the language and schema base object and overlays are meta language for data. 
</p>
<p><strong>phoniks</strong> (Fri, 10 May 2019 01:36:12 GMT):<br/>
Okay I think I'm starting to understand.

<p><strong>nage</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 19:17:41 GMT):<br/>
Wow, I have really fallen behind on this thread.  My idea was that the identifier would be based on the commit hash and that the DID Doc itself could contain the main public location of the repository as the service endpoint.  That way a repo could be self contained and tools could deal with permissioning or "transaction validation" locally.  This makes a git repo effectively into a full blockchain system with the main DID doc acting like the genesis or constitution block that can be used to process subsequent transactions

New members of this channel would probably benefit from introductory presentations of the two main semantics initiatives currently being worked on by members of the _Indy Semantics WG_ , namely: (i.) the *Rich Schemas* work (Spearheaded by @kenebert / @brentzundel ) and the *Overlays data capture architecture* (ODCA) (Spearheaded by @pknowles / @mtfk ). Hit the :thumbsup: emoji if you agree with that proposal. If it looks like there is substantial interest, I'll schedule in two 1O1 sessions so that newbies can be brought up to speed.

<p><strong>jwow</strong> (Sat, 18 May 2019 23:07:39 GMT):<br/>
If you mean an interactive zoom session, I’m in Sydney (GMT+10) so time can be an issue.
</p>
<p><strong>jwow</strong> (Sun, 19 May 2019 06:57:06 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for that.  I think I've a good understanding of what you're trying to accomplish but I still believe there are omissions that are critical for this to proceed.  My background comes from XBRL, a framework for exchanging financial or business information (XML based) utilised by many government agencies around the world.  Overall it is very similar to what you've described using the term "linkbase" rather than "overlay".  E.g. Linkbases for Label, Calculations, Definitions, Presentation.
</p>
<p><strong>jwow</strong> (Sun, 19 May 2019 07:24:16 GMT):<br/>
The critical difference is that XBRL is concerned with the 'facts' or as they refer to them 'concepts' .    Concepts are like object classes, while Items are object instances.  Concepts are typically given a particular code "
</p>
<p><strong>jwow</strong> (Sun, 19 May 2019 07:24:44 GMT):<br/>
Sorry problems with desktop Rocket.
</p>
<p><strong>jwow</strong> (Sun, 19 May 2019 07:31:10 GMT):<br/>
Concepts are typically given a code, much like passport fields, that avoids the biases of language (to some degree). 
So a field '5F2B' has a semantic meaning of 'date of birth'.  Using a Label link base this can then be presented as 'Birth Date', 'Date of Birth', 'Date de Naisance', '生日' or whatever while still preserving its meaning.  This provides much greater interoperability across languages.  Of course you could standardise on Romanised Latin alphabet with Arabic numerals but I think that is to much of a western bias.
</p>
<p><strong>jwow</strong> (Sun, 19 May 2019 07:35:39 GMT):<br/>
Similarly acceptable values can be given for one language then overlayed with another, extended for one country's specific use or remapped for another's.  E.g. in Australia gender is typically one of 5 choices: 'Male', 'Female', 'Neither', 'Unknown', 'Declined'.  Each of these values would have an associated identifier, so they could be easily translated to another language.
</p>
<p><strong>jwow</strong> (Sun, 19 May 2019 07:38:56 GMT):<br/>
Finally, in defining the 'facts', we need to acknowledge that some require a specific 'as at' date, while the others require 'period' dates.  For example, a 'Balance' field is useless unless you know the 'as at' date.  While an 'Income' field is pointless if there is not period (FY2019) associated with it.
</p>
<p><strong>jwow</strong> (Sun, 19 May 2019 07:44:07 GMT):<br/>
Lest you think these are traits associated only with finance, consider the 'address' field of a driver's license.  Generally it means an 'as at' but for other credentials (say police criminal check) it may be for a period, i.e. at 10 Xyz Street from 1-Jan-2010 to 31-Dec-2013.
</p>
<p><strong>jwow</strong> (Sun, 19 May 2019 07:45:20 GMT):<br/>
Another omission is that that a concept or collection of concepts may have a 'dimension'.  This may be values over a number of months/years or across a number of places.  
</p>
<p><strong>pknowles</strong> (Sun, 19 May 2019 07:59:50 GMT):<br/>
@jwow Thanks for your input and brief overview of XBRL. I'm tagging in @mtfk , the lead ODCA software architect. He'll be interested in any technical differences between the architectures. As I mentioned previously, the initial published paper doesn't go too deep into some of the more granular parts of the architecture. It was written so that people could better understand the overall concept. We still need to bring all aspects together under one shared roof. If you go to https://github.com/THCLab/schema-cake and read the README.md file, you'll see that, much like "Concepts" in XBRL, "Schema Elements" (which we should probably rename "Schema Base Elements") can also be coded.

@jwow Thanks for your input and brief overview of XBRL. I'm tagging in @mtfk , the lead ODCA software architect. He'll be interested in any technical differences between the architectures. As I mentioned previously, the initial published paper doesn't go too deep into some of the more granular parts of the architecture. It was written so that people could better understand the overall concept. We still need to bring all aspects together under one shared roof. If you go to https://github.com/THCLab/schema-cake and read the README.md file, you'll see that, much like "Concepts" in XBRL, "Schema Elements" (which we should probably rename "Schema Base Elements") have a DID reference to help drive standardisation.

There are a number of aspects of ODCA that address fundamental issues that XBRL doesn't appear to address: (i.) a built in schema object for flagging PII attributes [check BIT - ref. https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1gSD1b70OySIUKNOQTSbQ7khq9oy1V8UP ]; (ii.) the separation of personal data processing, generic consent and specialised consent to enable better consent management throughout the data lifecycle [check PDP - ref. https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1FFU47tCTu7XbNnpD2oZlbgglrKiTh5yb ] and (iii.)

@mtfk From the ongoing discussion with @jwow , this is the only aspect that I wanted to double-check with you. I think that this is covered by a combination of a *source overlay* (which deals with dynamic variables) and attributes captured in a linked *PDP schema* (which define parameters for data access). I'd love to hear your thoughts on this point.

<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Sun, 19 May 2019 11:15:38 GMT):<br/>
@jwow  I am not familiar with XBRL but for OCDA some of the most important properties are:
- immutable
- discoverable
- uniquely identifiable 
- context aware
 For sure you can find some similarities between ODCA and XBRL. ODCA define just the meta language and rules how all stuff should be build. It is not forcing anyone to name field specifically. Standards and most popular schema base objects and overlays would come directly from community and experts from fields. But still it would provide interoperability across different sectors. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Sun, 19 May 2019 11:28:33 GMT):<br/>
The problem which ODCA is trying to solve is to provide unify data language across any sectors. E.g. XBRL is suited for business reporting. Probably won't fit very well into health care or ecommerce. The future is all about data. We need to find a away to connect different worlds where data are generated, hold or stored. This would be crucial to get data economy possible. You can imagine that business report which you generated with XBRL someone would like to sell on open market or store in his digital wallet. To make that happen ODCA create set of rules which are level higher then any data language like XBRL.
</p>
<p><strong>jwow</strong> (Mon, 20 May 2019 02:42:10 GMT):<br/>
XBRL is indeed focussed on business, but the solution itself is a design (IMHO) that is equally applicable to Credentials & Claims.  For example, every concept (fact) has a periodType attribute: typically 'instant' or 'duration' (occasionally 'forever').  This is useful to distinguish the 'fact' from the 'fact attribute' to better understand a claim: is this address, for example, at an instant of time or for a period of time?  Of course, a 'context' is needed to determine these.  The 'context' gives understanding to the facts in which they are being used.  A context 'period' element communicates that period the 'fact' relates to, e.g., the issue date and the expiry date.  So the context can be associated with the credential, while the individual claim 'vehicle class licensed to drive = 5' is bound in that context. 
</p>
<p><strong>jwow</strong> (Mon, 20 May 2019 03:22:58 GMT):<br/>
I'm not proposing that XBRL should be used for Credentials and Claims.  Just that we should adopt the same or similar underlying principles.  These include extensibility, interoperability and multilingual.

<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 07:41:55 GMT):<br/>
What about doing a short presentation about XBRL during our next Semantic Call? I would love to learn a bit more about that topic and see how ODCA could enrich already existing solutions or even just use them. 
@pknowles do we have free slot for such presentation for next call?

@jwow The bi-weekly Indy Semantics WG calls are every other Tuesday at 3am AEST so we'll forgive you for not attending those calls! I'll reach out to by DM to see if we can arrange an ad-hoc conference call for a XBRL/ODCA discussion. Would you be up for presenting the architecture to me and @mtfk at a date/time that suits you well? Our timezone is CET.
</p>
<p><strong>jwow</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 08:05:39 GMT):<br/>
Sure. Maybe like a 6am here.  At a function at moment.  I'll think about it and outline more later.

<p><strong>jwow</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 04:59:02 GMT):<br/>
In regard to the structure of requests from verifier our experience in Australia may be relevant:  the “100 point check” (see Wikipedia) requires holders to submit a wide variety of credentials, each with different values or weighting, until at least 100 points is reached.  This may be passport or birth certificate (70 points) down to drivers license (40 points), mortgage doc (35) or credit card or auto club membership (25).  So the user must submit between 2 and 4 credentials.  

At APRA, we designed and created or own Domain Specific Language utilising XBRL within a specific Taxonomy.  Using short tokens, say PT304, for “Name”, and ADF603 for the form/credential, we could easily write a rule to assign a weight to a credential and add the weight.  We could also ensure specific claims such as name, address and dob were consistent across all forms/credentials, or suitable change of address/name credentials were also provided.

The evaluation of the DSL was done on the edge device, so no data strictly needed to be transferred.  

Does this help?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 15:43:45 GMT):<br/>
Sound very interesting, I am evaluating possibility to use signals and artifacts for identification where base on different weight of attributes you can identify a person or a thing. Would love to learn more about this "100 point check" and the way how XBRL could actually support such that flow. I was thinking about similar approach for ODCA where you by preserving context and weight you could answer same question using different data and schema. E.g. to prove that you are above 18 years old you could: show passport, driving license, monthly ticket for last 2 years (for adult), diploma from university or simply other data which are some how related with adult person.

The *Blinding Identity Taxonomy* (BIT) aims to provide a needed common standards to help protect the privacy of _personally identifiable information_ (PII) about people, organizations, or things. Note that the current version of the BIT does not identify correlation patterns. That may be considered in future versions as correlation patterns emerge. 

The latest version of the BIT resides with Kantara Initiative’s _Consent & Information Sharing WG_. Here is the BIT link ... https://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/infosharing/Blinding+Identity+Taxonomy

During this week’s *Hyperledger Indy Semantics WG* call, I put the spotlight on the two contained elements that are integral to SSI that I had been entered on the list at conception. Namely, …

- _Self-sovereign Key Identifiers_
- _Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs)_

Now that the SSI technology is more mature, I believe that those elements can be removed and the following two elements should be added …

- _Private keys / master keys_
- _Public keys / symmetric keys_

I had mentioned various DID types and DID Docs during the call but, on closer revision, I would suggest that only the above keys would actually constitute PII. 

I'm keen to hear the thoughts of the community on this matter.

During this week’s *Hyperledger Indy Semantics WG* call, I put the spotlight on two contained elements that are integral to SSI that had been included in the taxonomy at the time of conception. Namely, …

- _Self-sovereign Key Identifiers_
- _Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs)_

Now that SSI technology is more mature, I believe that those elements can be removed and replaced by the following two elements …

- _Private keys / master keys_
- _Public keys / symmetric keys_

I had mentioned various DID types and DID Docs during the call but, on closer revision, I would suggest that only the above keys would actually constitute PII. 

I'm keen to hear people's thoughts of this.

 Hi Team i have question
please help me to get more knowledge on this

Suppose a DID document of a device is there

and this device also have verifiable credentials


Now questions is ---->

What kind of service does a service end point of that device offers

and if a verifier has to check the authneticity of the device using service endpoint

how will he because the verifiable credentials are already available and it can easily verify those by comparing signatures
what additional information we can get from service end point about authenticity of anything even when we have verifiable credentials available for that

</p>

</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 04:23:59 GMT):<br/>
@SethiSaab I believe the short answer is that, if the device has a DID document including an agent service endpoint but the device does not actually host its own agent—rather the agent lives in the cloud—then you could only authenticate the agent for the device, not the device itself.
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 04:24:21 GMT):<br/>
In order to authentication the device itself, it must have its own wallet and agent, however minimal.
</p>
<p><strong>SethiSaab</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 05:10:30 GMT):<br/>
@drummondreed  Thanks for the explanation
</p>
<p><strong>SethiSaab</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 05:11:03 GMT):<br/>
and this will done with the concept of DID -AUTH or something similar to that 
</p>
<p><strong>SethiSaab</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 05:11:05 GMT):<br/>
right?
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 05:12:50 GMT):<br/>
Yes. As the DID Comm protocol is proceeding, the easiest option is simply sending a message using authenticated encryption using the DID Comm protocol.
</p>
<p><strong>SethiSaab</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 05:14:48 GMT):<br/>
Hi Guys I have a question .
As per my knowledge . when we create a DID document it gets saved in parts ... in case of Uport and BItcoin and we get block id and transaction ID . to fetch complete DID Document
but I am confused ... like when we search a DID Document using DID... .how will that work
?
</p>
<p><strong>SethiSaab</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 05:19:31 GMT):<br/>
I have seen that in case of DID based on bctr . it actually uses   the 3rd part (xxxx-xxxx-xxxx)  of did   did:bctr:xxxx-xxxx-xxxx  to reach at the correct block and transaction  
</p>
<p><strong>SethiSaab</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 05:19:43 GMT):<br/>
and that is how it gets the complete document
</p>
<p><strong>SethiSaab</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 05:19:53 GMT):<br/>
but how does that works in INDY 
</p>
<p><strong>SethiSaab</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 12:31:04 GMT):<br/>
Hi Guys ,
</p>
<p><strong>SethiSaab</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 12:32:25 GMT):<br/>
I have a question regarding construction of DID documents. I have seen that on some platform did documents are getting generated by extracting data from multiple transactions. like in BTCR did method and in uport did method.  Could someone help to understand that how is this working?
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Sat, 15 Jun 2019 21:22:03 GMT):<br/>
@SethiSaab It is similar on Indy. The NYM transaction stores the actual DID and public key; ATTRIB transactions are used for other  DID document properties like service endpoints. A DID resolver such as the DIF Universal Resolver will request all these transactions from an Indy ledger and then compose them into the DID document (if that is the DID resolution result requested).
</p>
<p><strong>SethiSaab</strong> (Sun, 16 Jun 2019 05:59:39 GMT):<br/>
@drummondreed   so there will be multiple transanactions  and did resolver will combine multipe transactions and extract the data from Attrib transactions merge them and construct a document.  Am i right ?
</p>
<p><strong>SethiSaab</strong> (Sun, 16 Jun 2019 06:00:00 GMT):<br/>
as of now i have seen that uport and btcr are saving DID document off chain
</p>
<p><strong>SethiSaab</strong> (Sun, 16 Jun 2019 06:00:07 GMT):<br/>
which is kinda following centralized model
</p>
<p><strong>SethiSaab</strong> (Sun, 16 Jun 2019 06:00:27 GMT):<br/>
but wouldn't saving data on blockchain affect scalability and performance
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Sun, 16 Jun 2019 16:10:46 GMT):<br/>
@SethiSaab Yes, you are right. uPort and BTCR are using IPFS to save the raw DID document. With Indy, the individual properties of the DID document are stored directly on the ledger. They are small, and Indy ledgers are needed only for public DIDs (the vast majority of DIDs will be peer DIDs that are not stored on a public ledger), so scalability and performance should not be an issue.
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Sun, 16 Jun 2019 16:11:17 GMT):<br/>
If you haven't read the Peer DID spec, you should. https://dhh1128.github.io/peer-did-method-spec/index.html

In January, I wrote a submission to the UK Parliament's Human Rights Committee inquiry on The Right to Privacy ( Article 8 ) and the Digital Revolution. The submission explained how the *Blinding Identity Taxonomy* (BIT) initiative would provide a common standards to help protect the privacy of personally identifiable information (PII) about people, organisations, or things. I've just been informed by the Committee Assistant that the submission has been published.

A question to put to all active members of this channel. There have been a number of offline discussions regarding the potential migration of the *Indy Semantics WG* over to Aries (i.e. *Aries Semantics WG* ). Regarding the ODCA work, that is a no-brainer as that architecture is platform agnostic. The question is whether the Rich Schema work can follow suit. I think we should but it to a non-formal vote to start with. Either click on the :thumbsup: or :thumbsdown: emojis to show your preference. We can do a more formal vote on a future WG call. For now, click an emoji!

As the Rich Schema work matures and it becomes ready for integration, it might be a good idea to migrate the work to Aries, in my opinion.

@all - The next *Indy Semantics WG* call is on Tuesday, June 25th at 11am-12.15pm MT (7pm-8.15pm CET) where we will be discussing a proposed HIPE for the context objects as part of the rich schema work that @kenebert and @brentzundel have been spearheading. The proposed HIPE has just been published. Please review and add your comments to this important document before then so that we can have a valuable discussion during the WG call. Thanks, all. https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0138-rich-schema-context

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 17:45:39 GMT):<br/>
Regarding Paul Knowles' rich schema question: The crux of the decision, I think, is whether the rich schema work is broader than Indy. Is it our intention that all Aries people should be exposed to and hopefully adopt the rich schema work? If yes, then appropriate location is Aries. If no, then appropriate location is Indy. Specs for Indy's unique approach to credentials belong in Indy, not Aries--that seems clear. I'm less sure about the rich schema stuff.

@danielhardman - As the Indy Semantics WG calls are bi-weekly, there might be an opportunity to alternate between *Indy Semantics * and *Aries Semantics* WG calls on weekly rotation. If we were to do that, I would suggest that @kenebert become the new chair of the Indy Semantics WG and step into a vice role. We could then set up a new Aries Semantics WG which I would happily chair and Ken could step into a vice role for that group. This would enable us to maintain synergy between the two semantics WGs as we progress. That might work.

<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Sun, 23 Jun 2019 22:36:25 GMT):<br/>
@pknowles That makes sense to me. I look at it this way: Indy architecture currently represents one credential format and exchange protocol, the primitives for which are supported on the Indy ledger. Aries is now separating out the P2P DID connection and credential exchange layers so that they can work with any ledger that wants to support them. So I see "Indy credential semantics" slowly converging with "Aries credential semantics", and starting with these two calls is a good way to move along that path.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-semantics?msg=kgppmodjSLyNPtQ22) @phoniks  I will prepare new schema base example + overlays this week and share here. I am planning to use similar approach with vue: https://github.com/vue-generators/vue-form-generator for existing project https://github.com/THCLab/tool . Basically the schema base and overlays would have definition file which you can take an use to validate against newly created ones. If you can't wait to start you can take existing examples from https://github.com/THCLab/schema-cake which gives you  good start. We need to update this repo with some minor changes but overall it should work for you. If you would have any questions just let me know here.

During todays WG call, I mentioned the *DPVCG Vocabulary* specification [W3C: Data Privacy Vocabularies and Controls Community Group] which comes hot off the press. The Dativa Innovation team are looking to use DPV defined attributes in 2 ODCA-constructed schemas, namely: (i.) _Personal Data Processing_ (PDP) schema and (ii.) _Generic Consent_ schema. We're also discussing  _personally identifiable information_ (PII) flags in section 4 of the spec with reference to the _Blinding Identity Taxonomy_ (BIT) [https://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/infosharing/Blinding+Identity+Taxonomy ].

During the next *Indy Semantics WG* call (Tuesday, July 9th), @janl will be presenting a preliminary demo on *consent lifecycle using Hyperledger Indy*. The demo goes through the automated steps of setting up the ledger, exchange of PDP (personal data processing) requirements, creating a consent receipt certificate, performing a proof that a consent was given and taking down the ledger. Alice, Bob, Acme and Faber are our volunteer actors once again!

The demo goes through the automated steps of setting up the ledger, exchange of PDP (personal data processing) requirements, creating a consent receipt certificate, performing a proof that a consent was given and taking down the ledger. Alice, Bob, Acme and Faber are our volunteer actors once again!

I was on the call. Will try to summarize what I remember
1. DPV by Harsh was about  Data Protection Vocabulary developed in a w3C community group: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qQIdIxpkPdldS_RR7x8L2ZAq3plse9yd-WxcFZgBjY0/edit#slide=id.gc6f9e470d_0_126```
2. It is expressed in RDF, it is a collection of vocabularies covering multiple dimensions and highly focused on GDPR themes (like data controllers and the like)
3. The dimensions include data subject, purpose (including legal basis), consent, and a host of others (more details in the slides- look at 3,4 etc)
4.  Follow on by a demo of consent lifecycle 
```

Hello everyone, is there a way to send some data when sending a proof request? 
I mean, let's say a data controller (DC) is asking gov attested address to a data subject (DS) in a proof request and wants to specify the reason for the ask as well. So is it possible to send that data in the form of key value pair in a proof request 
</p>
<p><strong>ravip</strong> (Sat, 13 Jul 2019 19:40:10 GMT):<br/>
*request?
</p>
<p><strong>ravip</strong> (Sat, 13 Jul 2019 19:51:31 GMT):<br/>
Also, is there some kind of explorer for microledger between entities wherein a data subject could see what they have consented to and for how long to data controllers?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-semantics?msg=RsKdfHe2hRyXvZFZq) The fun answer is perhaps :-).  Technically, yes it can be done.  The challenge is that the Holder must know what that extra data is about - why it is there and what to do with it.  To achieve interoperability, we are building up versioned protocols that define the interactions between agents indepdently implemented.  **There is a current specification for the "Present Proof" process that describes protocol here - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0037-present-proof

In theory, you could use the "comment" field for that, but again, the Holder is likely to just display that to the Holder/Prover.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 02:17:41 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-semantics?msg=onAgSi6k6u6FZDg5k) The implementation of the "microledger" has evolved to be more of a set of related records in a data store. There is a connection object (the relationship between the entities that swapped pairwise, private DIDs) and there is data collected about the connection. All of that is stored in secured storage ("wallet" in Indy), and can be manipulated by the agent code as necessary.  It is not implemented as ledger in the blockchain sense (distributed data store with consensus, etc.).  You can look at the code in https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python for an implementation.

Thank you @swcurran for sharing your knowledge and pointers on the topic.

<p><strong>ravip</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 06:45:44 GMT):<br/>
I was trying to build a consent application using hyperledget indy and I was thinking how would one implement the process of 'revoking consent'?

I listened to the recorded call and got an idea that granting consent could be implemented interms of Data controller (DC) issuing a Verifiable Credential (VC) to Data Subject (DS) thereby giving a consent receipt to DS, later on a verifier could request a proof from the DS for the same.

But lets say, if DS wants to revoke the consent that he has already provided, then how would that work?

</p>
<p><strong>ravip</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 06:54:25 GMT):<br/>
Will DC keep on continuously checking if DS has revoked the consent or not and if he has, then invalidate the claim?

Good questions @ravip. You seem to have several, but will answer the revoking consent first. Planned to use the consent receipt certificate revocation. The DS has to inform DC to revoke consent which triggers the revocation by the DC. Due to the fact you cannot trust the DC the DS controls the verification (proof request) from a 3rd party (subDC) and basically make assertions that fail the proof. The verifier may have difficulty to discern a consent revocation since proof is a simple check of assertions. Need to work out how this best can be achieved.

Correct. The old HIPE will become an Aries RFC. What may not be completely clear is in which form will the RFC look like. Goal is to create a best practices and guidance of how to setup consent receipt.

Hi guys, it's purely by accident that I dropped in to watch today recording.  Thank you @pknowles for noting the article on DNS.  My particular interest is that I've built a Universal DID Server based entirely on DNS procotols and structures using the DnsServer open source project as a basis.  It's working and working very well ...still early but it's working.  Here's a screenshot....

Guardianship Task Force white paper draft—please review if you are able as we will be using this to hold a session at Internet Identity Workshop next week: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d1I3f4sBlc9nLt_TAtsXvi-EKSzECaQObKZPL0Zx_9U/edit?usp=sharing

<p><strong>janl</strong> (Sun, 29 Sep 2019 16:17:53 GMT):<br/>
Interesting read. Would this be a special form of consent? For example a court may assign guardianship to an individual. This would be down by having the court "consent" to a guardian to represent the individual.

Hi,
I have an update to my rfc: 167, data consent lifecycle, which may be of general interest. I have given several demos of how indy-sdk can be used can used for creating consent receipt and performing proof request without revealing any private information. The demo is based on getting-started and is now available as a reference implementation for anybody to check out. Once Aries is ready the plan is to adapt it over. The next step for the reference implementation is to add revocation example which is on the works. Welcome to come with feedback.

https://github.com/JanLin/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0167-data-consent-lifecycle

Best regards,
Jan

Note the new reference implementation is in a Pull Request #238 to hyperledger:master.

The Blinding Identity Taxonomy (BIT) is a list of 47 elements that could potentially unblind the identity of an organisation, a person or a thing. https://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/infosharing/Blinding+Identity+Taxonomy

A 48th element will soon be added to the BIT ... "Link Secrets"

*Link Secret*
An item of Private Data used by a Prover to link a Credential uniquely to the Prover. A Link Secret is an input to Zero Knowledge Proofs that enables Claims from one or more Credentials to be combined in order to prove that the Credentials have a common Holder (the Prover). A Link Secret should be known only to the Prover.

From Identity Working Group presentation by @janl 
Notes have been updated see https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/IWG/2019-10-16 for details

Notes:
Jan Linquist gave a teaser on the RFC Consent in Hyperledger Aries .

The paper consists of : 

An ontology - terms that are relevant and objects that are built up from these terms

Legal compliance standards
How can DID based systems implement a consent lifecyle
A reference implementation of a lifecycle
Consent certificate + proof
Process Flow
Jan says the paper should be properly called the enforcement of a Privacy Agreement
We spoke briefly of the following hard problems

Hierarchy of sharing (what if the original relying party (RP) sells or shares the information to another party) and so on?
Selective disclosure, granularity and quality of information shared (derived information like age boundary-i.e. older than x, younger than y from birthday)
Meta data harvesting (IP addresses, location) and creating correlations
Bankruptcy and delegation of control of privacy proof 
Forgetting: what sort of regulation should control this
Common themes and ideas around sovereign or multi-state regulations (like GDPR, India Consent Layer, CCA, New York state privacy, Chinese regulation on consent) and how to implement them, are there patterns code snippets libraries
Some techniques proposed on the Semantics call

Adding masking layers for psuedonimisation
Metadata turns up as machine readable quasi-identifiers- what to do about this
Jan agreed to do a demo of the reference lifecycle in a future meeting- we will publicize this and hopefully we will have greater participation.

that is probably a question for someone from Sovrin/Evernym but from that doc i linked it seems that if it is compromised then you will be at risk of correlation but not of identity theft

<p><strong>pknowles</strong> (Sat, 26 Oct 2019 12:46:25 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, Jonathan. I appreciate your input. I think we should add it to the BIT as it sounds like the element should always be encrypted if it were to fall outside of its intended verification purpose. From a data capture perspective, I would always flag it as sensitive and the BIT is a reference document for safe data capture. @danielhardman @MALodder

@janl There were some questions from the impromptu talk you gave last week from Randy Zhang from cisco which you may not have seen if you are not on the mailing list. I quote the email below...

"Thanks for sharing Vipin/Jan.

Questions:

    Are there provisions to perform real-time id attestation (proofing in your chart)?
    On the expiration of access, is the attribute or id removed from the database or just the access is revoked? I think there should be hierarchical RBAC for every ID attribute attribute with automatic revoking plus user allowed revoking timer. The ID owner has complete control over all the ID attributes that are inherent with the user (internal ID attributes).
"

@pknowles was not able to attend yesterday's  meeting- I will read the agenda notes etc. to get a better idea of what was talked about. I have two points to add:
1. We need to talk about consent (especially telling is the backtracking of gitlab about the collection of telemetry data)
2. A reframing of the question of "data protection" by Elizabeth Reneiris on medium- I respect Elizabeth's viewpoint- please read and let me know what you think. https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/distracted-by-data-dbe40033591c Going back to the basics helps sometimes

<p><strong>pknowles</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 14:56:25 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, @VipinB . I respect Elizabeth's opinions so I look forward to reading the article. From my perspective, the link between trusted source and data sharing is vital for a healthy flow of information. The trick is not to become a prisoner of our personal data. Data sharing is absolutely vital so we're looking for the perfect blend of data flagging and subsequent encryption alongside SSI (decentralised identity). If any of those mechanisms are flawed, the model for a secure decentralised data economy breaks. ODCA is hugely powerful from the data capture perspective. SSI is hugely powerful from an identity perspective. We are working on bringing harmony between those two essential cogs.
</p>
<p><strong>janl</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 16:04:53 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB Let me see if I can answer the question from Randy. Expiration relates to when the service ends. The attribute limitation indicates how long the data will be kept. In case of forget I would say a new consent receipt is created that supersedes the previous consent with limitation set to 0. A technique of pseudynomization is mentioned the association between ID and data is removed when forgetting.

Hope this gives some ideas. They are welcome to comment in semantic mailing list or attend one of the WG calls.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 18:26:00 GMT):<br/>
@janl we talked about consent today at the IDWG call. The India consent layer came up again and @nitin.agarwal will give a presentation on this architecture at a later date. I would like to possibly unify the ideas around this topic and address in a short form in the Identity paper.

In her article, Elizabeth focuses on: 
(i.) data as a distraction from real human engagement; and 
(ii.) an acknowledgement that we are facing data governance challenges. 

Re the first point, I agree that society is becoming less engaged on a very human level but I blame _technology_ rather than _data_. I myself am guilty of using technology as a distancing tool! 

Re the second point, I totally agree. However, as I've delved deeper into the development of data semantics through my ODCA work, I'm convinced that the large majority of people don't fully understand the power of a well-conceived semantic architecture for data capture. The semantics gurus are now starting to discuss overlays to deal with data watermarking, data quality, masking and data as currency. I'm not saying that all of these concepts will stick but I am saying that ODCA changes the current data landscape and, in particular, data governance possibilities.

The semantics gurus are now starting to discuss overlays to deal with data watermarking, data quality, masking and data as currency. I'm not saying that all of these concepts will stick but I am saying that ODCA changes the current data landscape and, in particular, data governance possibilities.

Re the first point, I agree that society is becoming less engaged on a very human level but I blame _technology_ rather than _data_. I myself am guilty of using technology as a distancing tool!

Another view on this could be that "privacy" is the goal and "data governance" is the means. Focusing on the goal as an abstraction does not get you anywhere; however getting deep into the data governance aspect may not result in attaining the goal either. Unlike a "goal", privacy is a continuing concern as you noted.

Re the Blinding Identity Taxonomy, it would be good to get some community input on the following potential addition ... "Product Identifier". For example, if I come into some rich data re Maxidex, a drug manufactured by Novartis, I might be able to determine the identity of the company who published the data. However, Novartis might wish for 3rd parties to have access to that data without the identity of the company being revealed.

The BIT is supposed to protect the identity of organisations, people and things.

In my example, Maxidex is the pharmaceutical "tradename". Dexamethasone is the active ingredient. I would suggest that Maxidex is PII, Dexamethasone is not.

Maxidex is really supposed to be covered by ...

"Names (incl. First Names, Last Names, Full Names, Entity Names)"

... perhaps we should include "Product Names" in that inclusion list.

"Product Identifier" would be a new element on the list.

All thoughts welcome!

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 19:29:04 GMT):<br/>
@pknowles @mitfk About Modular blocks: I was on the call- It was not clear whether hl:<hash> would only refer to IPFS or you need any kind of disambiguation if the immutable store was different.

Really liked the idea that having a common place to get schema modules from creates a pathway for interoperability and freedom from attribute limitations on Sovrin.
Also Novartis' issues with selective disclosures was telling; since I believe we do not have such concepts today (everyone always asks for more data than they need- since they consume data in quanta associated with documents eg. All the data on the drivers license or the passport)- I think selective disclosure although popular with the SSI crowd may not have great take-up unless it is backed by regulation and by changing the schemas of data needed by relying parties with regulation.

All in all a worthwhile discussion and I was glad I spent time.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 19:32:28 GMT):<br/>
The other idea was using time to live as forcing a polling mechanism to introduce a push-like (event driven) mechanism into revocation- seems like this is used in many places (ttl for drivers license is 10 yrs in US); but if you get stopped by cops they do check the license revocation registry in real time.

<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Tue, 12 Nov 2019 21:10:59 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB  regarding the links basically I always tend to talk abotu DRI (Decentralized Resource Identifier) which is basically what is URL but content based. Means DRI could become a standard how you link data points which are immutable. If it is Sovrin schema or IPFS schema does not matter it could goes as 'dri://sov/schema/112354' or 'dri://ipfs/112354' which points to same content. This way no matter where the object is you can be 100% that is same thing. Same concept as with `magnet` link This way this "hashlink" can be actually DRI which then make whole process super simple.

@channel Regarding how we locate immutable data points, it would be great if we could come up with a stable solution for any use case. I think we can do that by delving into this idea of a *DRI* (Decentralized Resource Identifier) which is basically a similar concept to URL but content based. DRI could become a standard for how you link data points which are immutable. In other words, it wouldn't matter whether we're dealing with a Sovrin schema or an IPFS schema as 'dri://sov/schema/112354' and 'dri://ipfs/112354' would point to the same content. In this way, no matter where the object is housed, you can be 100% sure that we're referencing the same one. This is a similar concept to a _magnet link_. A DRI would make the whole process very simple. [ Ref. for _magnet link_: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme ]. Thoughts?

FAO all #indy-semantics channel members ... 

It would be great if we could come up with a stable identifier that can be used for any use case involving immutable data points. A popular idea that has been touched upon on a number of occasions is the concept of using a *DRI* (Decentralized Resource Identifier) which is basically a similar concept to URL but content based. DRI could become a standard for how you link data points which are immutable. In other words, it wouldn't matter whether we're dealing with a Sovrin schema or an IPFS schema as 'dri://sov/schema/112354' and 'dri://ipfs/112354' would point to the same content. In this way, no matter where the object is housed, you can be 100% sure that we're referencing the same object. This is a similar concept to a _magnet link_. A DRI would make the whole process very simple. [ Ref. for _magnet link_: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_URI_scheme ]. Thoughts and feedback welcome.

@pknowles In the example that you provided (also @mtfk ) 'dri://ipfs/112354' does 112354 refer to the hash of the attributes that you are including in the super-schema; I was looking for a reference to DRI to see whether there are formal standards for this. Was not able to come up with any. Maybe I am not looking in the right place. Magnet of course has lots of references. DRI is a special case of URI?
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 22:14:29 GMT):<br/>
DRI was invented by me as nice name for the thing which we need. There is no standard for it, maybe one day. Basically DRI does not much differ from what magnet link is. Maybe except that magnet link has a bad reputation of piracy behind it ;) I did a presentation about DRI in one of our semantic call you can check it out.

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 19:11:08 GMT):<br/>
Should we be inventing our own? I will take a look at the slides. Magnet seems like a good way to get at a URI with an embedded hash, it  contains a fingerprint of the doc as well. I am sure that someone will bring up the whole collision thing. Which of course may have to be addressed in your write-up and why a salt is not necessary.
Having the schema on the ledger- means (in my mind) there is a schema on the ledger- (the ledger has to be readable publicly- if the schema is public- at the minimum) or there is a way to get to schema using a pointer (DRI); or there is a way to assemble the schema using multiple pointers(DRIs). When I say pointer I mean that it has to be also reachable and readable by all (if it is a public schema).  Now you are also telling me that the hash at the tail of the schema will be the same for all dris that point to the same document and will be a fingerprint.
Querying is another story, since the schema details are subsumed in the DRI. Querying from the ledger is always hard (for random searches).
</p>
<p><strong>pknowles</strong> (Mon, 18 Nov 2019 06:54:33 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for your input, @VipinB . We'll bash this about some more to get consensus of opinion. Magnet may well be our best option here rather than DID. In any case, @mtfk and I have to come to a definite decision this week as we need a solid solution for a current pilot that we're working on.

<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 21:29:23 GMT):<br/>
During today Aries call I briefly mentioned about the need of schema interop (RFC in preparation). Basic idea is to make sure that schema can be reused across networks and can be resolved for any place. We believe that having interoperabale object like schema is the key for decentralized data economy. As we know schema is not only used as data structure for verifiable credentials. In my opinion there is much more use cases outside VC, like data storage, data transportation, data requests. Having one schema for VC and other for other data structure does not make sens this is why we need to seek for interoperability for this crucial object. 
What we are looking for is schema which:
- can be resolved from any place (without need to be member of particular network) 
- can be uniquely identifiable across different networks and systems (best content based - DRI - hashlinks)
- does not have limit on size nor amount of attributes
- have to be immutable - once posted never cahnges (see above content based identifiers)
- support any type of the data (blobs, text, arrays etc, so one of the attribute could be your MRI picture) 
- anything else?....
</p>

@kenebert ^
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 21:31:48 GMT):<br/>
obviously we are seeing ODCA with schema_base as a candidate which fulfill all above and we are looking for suggestion about how we could introduce changes to existing systems like indy and VC to support that flow as well.

1) I've now implemented didttps: (Secure DID Trusted Transport Protocol) using TLS over Tcp port 853 (instead of DNS Tcp port 53)
2) Here's a good explanation about the differences between DNS over TLS vs. DNS over HTTPS: https://www.ma-no.org/en/networking/configuring-dns-over-tls-and-dns-over-https-with-any-dns-server

The word _encode_ is used for both _binary-to-text encoding_ (e.g. sha256) and _character encoding_ (e.g. utf-8). Having spoken to @kdenhartog  , we decided that it would make sense to change the name of the current "encode overlay" to "character overlay" so that we have room to manoeuvre when we start working in the _binary-to-text encoding_ space. In other words, we will eventually have both a "character overlay" and a "binary-to-text overlay". Problem solved. Thanks, Kyle.

The semantics group have recently been discussing how to best resolve large data objects in verifiable credentials. A key technology, component and endpoint in that resolve is *Semantic Containers* for transient storage and data mobility. For anyone interested to learn more about the technology, click on the above link, go to "Videos", "2020-01-28" and watch the WG call video from 12 mins 55 secs onwards. Thanks to Christoph Fabianek from OwnYourData for a fascinating presentation/discussion regarding the technology.

Thanks for the input from the semantics group and especially to @swcurran for helping to get the flow sequence right for the following model. I presented this generic model during yesterday's semantics call describing how to go about *SSI onboarding prior to data capture consent*. I've pitched this IMI/PharmaLedger "Blockchain Enabled Healthcare" proposal to Roche. It would include the creation of a transformation tool to transform schema from ODM-XML format [ https://www.cdisc.org/standards/data-exchange/odm ] in their Data Capture Hub (DCH) to OCA-formatted objects which would enable consortium members to use interoperable schema objects when interacting with data transported to a new Data Sharing Hub (DSH) under the IMI umbrella. If anyone is working on a similar flow, feel free to use this model as a reference.

The Spherity [https://spherity.com] developers are keen to investigate *OCA* / *rich schema* integration. Their investigation will no doubt provide valuable knowledge to the Indy/Aries community. I believe we will need to introduce two new overlays to make full integration possible: an "order overlay" (mappings) and a "binary-to-text encoding overlay" (encodings). I look forward to feeding back with news of their findings.

The best resource for OCA is The Human Colossus GitHub repository: https://github.com/thclab

For the latest update on where Evernym are at with their rich schema project development work, head to 8 mins 15 secs of the following demo video. This was posted just yesterday so is bang up to date. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ84bCxEKWo&list=PLRp0viTDxBWGLdZk0aamtahB9cpJGV7ZF

I believe that we will ultimately need to introduce two new overlays to make full integration possible: an "order overlay" (what the rich schema guys refer to as _mappings_) and a "binary-to-text encoding overlay" (what they refer to as _encodings_) but let's see what Carsten's team can find out following a deep dive.

New overlays for the development pipeline include ...

- _Risk overlay_ to allow issuers to add a unique sensitivity level to any attributes that have been flagged in the schema base. (Context: https://wiki.idesg.org/wiki/index.php/Trustworthy_Healthcare_Provider#Data_Categorization)
- _Order overlay_ to allow issues to set a distinct attribute order within the schema.
- _Binary-to-text encoding overlay_ to allow the encoding of binary data in a sequence of printable characters.

The Spherity [https://spherity.com] developers are keen to investigate OCA / rich schema integration. Their investigation will no doubt provide valuable feedback to the Indy/Aries community. I believe we'll need to develop two new overlays to make full integration possible: (i.) an _order overlay_ (mappings) and (ii.) a _binary-to-text encoding overlay_ (encodings). I look forward to receiving feedback from Spherity following their deep dive.

I've never been too keen on the term _Rich Schema_ as they have nothing to do with the data capture side of the network model - the common schema space. For those who are new to the concept, think of rich schema as _rich credential schema_. That is more accurate in terms of the network model.

I've never been too keen on the term _Rich Schema_ as they have nothing to do with the data capture side of the network model - the common schema space. For those who are new to the concept, think of rich schema as _rich credential schema_. That would be more accurate in terms of the network model. _(Note: Identity people naming semantic objects usually ends up in a land grab. Same thing with DIDs and there being no DID home for non-governed objects!)_

The Spherity [https://spherity.com] developers are keen to investigate OCA and Rich Schema integration. Their investigation will no doubt provide valuable feedback to the Indy/Aries community. I believe we'll need to develop two new overlays to make full integration possible: (i.) an _order overlay_ (mappings) and (ii.) a _binary-to-text encoding overlay_ (encodings). I look forward to receiving feedback from Spherity following their deep dive.

The best *OCA* (Overlays Capture Architecture) resource is The Human Colossus GitHub repository: https://github.com/thclab

New overlays in the development pipeline include, ...
- *Risk overlay* to allow issuers to add a unique sensitivity level to attributes that have been flagged as sensitive in a schema base. 
(Context: https://wiki.idesg.org/wiki/index.php/Trustworthy_Healthcare_Provider#Data_Categorization)
- *Order overlay* to allow issuers to add a definitive order to attributes in a schema base.
- *Binary-to-text encoding overlay* _(encoding of binary data in a sequence of printable characters)_ to allow issuers to lock in hash functions (e.g. SHA-256 encryption) to ordered attributes defined by an _order overlay_.

@brentzundel / @kenebert - "ZEA" is a dramatically better name than "Rich Schema". I'll put it down as an agenda item for the next Semantics WG call to open up the discussion. See mini-deck below to help naming of network components.

The Spherity [https://spherity.com] developers are keen to investigate OCA and Rich Schema integration. Their investigation will no doubt provide valuable feedback to the Indy/Aries community. I believe we'll need to develop two new overlays to make full integration possible: (i.) an _order overlay_ (mappings) and (ii.) a _binary-to-text encoding overlay_ (encodings). I look forward to receiving feedback from Spherity following their deep dive.

The best *OCA* (Overlays Capture Architecture) resource is The Human Colossus GitHub repository: https://github.com/thclab

New overlays in the development pipeline include, ...
- *Risk overlay* to allow issuers to add a unique sensitivity level to attributes that have been flagged as sensitive in a schema base. 
(Context: https://wiki.idesg.org/wiki/index.php/Trustworthy_Healthcare_Provider#Data_Categorization)
- *Order overlay* to allow issuers to add a definitive order to attributes in a schema base.
- *Binary-to-text encoding overlay* _(encoding of binary data in a sequence of printable characters)_ to allow issuers to lock in hash functions (e.g. SHA-256 encryption) to ordered attributes defined by an _order overlay_.

For the latest update on where Evernym are at with their *Rich Schema* project development work, go from 8 mins 15 secs of the following demo video. This was posted just yesterday so is bang up to date. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ84bCxEKWo&list=PLRp0viTDxBWGLdZk0aamtahB9cpJGV7ZF

List of Rich Schema RFCs ...

- 0138: *Contexts for Rich Schema Objects* - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/master/text/0138-rich-schema-context

- 0156: *Rich Schema Credential Definition* - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/master/text/0156-rich-schema-cred-def

I've never been a fan on the name _Rich Schema_ as the framework has nothing to do with the female (data capture) side of the network - the _Schema_ space. Rich Schema actually sit in the _Credential_ space. For those who are new to the concept, think of Rich Schema as a claim entry architecture. That would be more accurate in terms of painting a picture on where that piece sits.

Same thing with DIDs and there being no DID home for non-governed objects!)_

_ZKP Entry Architecture_ vs _Overlays Capture Architecture_ ... Just a thought.

Over the course of discussions with experts in the _Identity_ and _Consent_ communities before and during IIW, I believe that a clearer picture is starting to emerge on when the collective "we" should be using the word "trust" and when we should be using the word "assurance". The reason that this nuance is so important is that, having already knitted some key _Identity_ and _Semantics_ components together, The Human Colossus Foundation will now be shifting our focus to the _Consent_ piece by opening up discussions with the Open Consent Group as we start knitting _Identity_, _Consent_ and _Semantics_ components together as we continue to build middleware tooling for a Decentralized Data Economy (DDE). On the next *Indy Semantics WG* call I want to bring some focus on the "trust" versus "assurance" naming issue in a bid to gain consensus from key stakeholders from the three ecosystems so that we can all jump the hurdle together and continue down the "decentralized" path with renewed confidence. In my granular breakdown during the call, I hope to shed some light on when best to use the two terms. If anyone is interested in this debate, please join us on Tuesday, May 12th at 10am-11.15pm PT / 1pm-2.15pm ET / 6pm-7.15pm GMT. This is less of a bun fight and more of a focussed discussion of human interaction versus system interaction within the model. Those are the kernels.

This is as granular as I think I can go regarding the Trust over IP dual-stack.

_Human trust in digital systems = Social Cohesion + Cryptographic Assurance_

If anyone has any thoughts, I'm all ears.

Greetings. Just saw the Overlays 101 ssimeetup presentation again. Great stuff and seeking to get involved. Thanks Paul and Robert!

<p><strong>pknowles</strong> (Sat, 31 Oct 2020 18:46:33 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, @robdaa. We’ll be working on a revamped *Overlays Capture Architecture* (OCA) technical specification over the next few days which will be added as a new RFC on the Trust over IP GitHub repo. In the meantime, although in desperate need of lick of paint, *Aries RFC 0013: Overlays* is still the best technical resource out there presently. The *Semantics WG* at *Trust over IP* is the home for OCA pre-standards work. This is where you can keep up to date with all of the latest OCA developments. Those calls take place every Tuesday (11am MST / 6pm CET). For anyone interested in joining the ToIP Semantics WG as a contributing member, send an email to David Luchuk at dluchuk@contractor.linuxfoundation.org who will be able to help with the onboarding process. Feel free to namecheck me. It is free to join as an individual contributing member.
