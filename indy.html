We have been tracking Sovrin Development Events on a shared google calendar here: https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c292cmluLm9yZ18zcjdoa3V1bzZnc2puMmNwdGNkY2dubG9rMEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t

We put conferences where you can meet and talk with TGB members, maintainers and developers here when they are representing Sovrin in some way, along with development events where folks are hacking on Indy.  Let me know if you'd like to add something (a bunch of folks at sovrin.org have rights to add things to this calendar)
</p>
<p><strong>peacekeeper</strong> (Mon, 08 May 2017 22:11:11 GMT):<br/>
Hello @nage I travel quite often to events where I can speak about Sovrin and meet other people interested in it. I'd be happy to just announce it here and you can add it to the calendar?
</p>
<p><strong>peacekeeper</strong> (Mon, 08 May 2017 22:11:50 GMT):<br/>
E.g. this week a number of us are at the European Identity & Cloud Conference with several Sovrin-related talks and sessions: https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2017/
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Mon, 08 May 2017 22:19:31 GMT):<br/>
We should get those on the calendar.  I suggest we add this as an agenda item for TGB meetings so we don't lose track of it.

Our migration plan right now is to move Jira tickets over to Hyperledger first, then move github repositories and get through any CLA work before starting in on the CII badge issues (I think we already meet most of the CII requirements, which is why I haven't prioritized it).  I'm happy to move it up the priority list if it is helpful to you @dhuseby 
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 15:57:23 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. Just FYI, I don't think you have to switch to gerrit and Jira if you don't want too. Iroha uses github for all of that and they were just approved for graduation out of incubation by the technical steering committee this morning. 
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 15:57:41 GMT):<br/>
@Sean_Bohan ^^^
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 15:58:12 GMT):<br/>
I take their graduation as tacit approval of using github. 
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 15:59:39 GMT):<br/>
I certainly have no security concerns related to using github. But I do have concerns about gerrit. It is turning out to be an anti-pattern. Gerrit doesn't do branching well and that's the main resistance to the adoption of my proposed branching strategy. 
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 16:00:06 GMT):<br/>
Iroha uses my proposed branching strategy more or less. And they are on github. 
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 18 May 2017 16:16:19 GMT):<br/>
We are already using Jira internally, so we're thinking it makes sense to open that up to the community using the hyperledger Jira server.  We are also planning on sticking with github, rather than move over to gerrit (our community is already very familiar with github).

<p><strong>LoveshHarchandani</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 18:04:09 GMT):<br/>
The problem is that we assume that incoming data is going to be utf-8, we can make a rule that we only accept utf-8, wondering how to let the client know, using reqnack wont work since the code will not reach at that point, so for now just logging an error message as the node after handling such errors
</p>
<p><strong>devin-fisher</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 18:40:34 GMT):<br/>
@here Many of the developers at Evernym are participating in a shakedown of the Indy Node. So, there should be a fair amount activity around this.  Additionally, there will be a lot of activity around this in the Indy Jira around the shakedown.  Hopefully this will expose a lot bugs before the Sovrin network goes live with Indy.

We should probably have a concept of Named Pools. so a single file “pool_transactions_sandbox” can contain details of multiple different sovrin networks with one of them as default

so a user can easily change from one sovrin pool to another, I am not sure if shakedown Pool1 has been fixed so I wanted to switch to pool2 and this cannot be done without some manual file editing which can be made more usable

A pattern to be used when we close bugs/tickets:

Problem reason: 
- list of reasons

Changes: 
- list of changes

Committed into:
  github commit ref
  build version

Risk factors:
  Nothing is expected.

Risk:
  Low

Covered with tests:
Test ref on github

Recommendations for QA (optional):
</p>
<p><strong>krw910</strong> (Thu, 25 May 2017 14:04:45 GMT):<br/>

We are working out of Pool 3, and I have reset Pools 1, 2, and 4. I have setup the GST agents Faber, Acme, and Thrift for each of them so if you go through the GST you don't have to setup the agents. I have also turned on debug level in the logs on all the nodes for all the pools. 
If Pool 3 fails move to Pool 4 then Pool 1. Please let me know if the pool fails and you know why. We need to be able to log the steps in the ticket.

You may find these instructions helpful, in the meantime. They are written from the perspective of Sovrin rather than Indy, but that's just a branding issue. Most of the instructions are just as relevant. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CyggP4nNPyx4SELNZEc2FOeln6G0F22B37cAVtB_FBM/edit

@danielhardman, so that instruction is partially based on Python virtual environment, which I've not tried yet. For the Sovrin client I've so far just used Docker to build a runnable image. Some hacks are required on the Dockerfile to get it working ... so I was wondering: Is the the Python virtual environment you prefer currently, or will Docker eventually be supported as well? (Perhaps I ought to send patches to Dockerfile?) :)

On a different topic: A week ago there was the announcement of the Sovrin Foundation and Engage Identity partnership, with the purpose of conducting a technical review of the current security architecture, and a report coming this summer.
Will Indy benefit from this somehow? More specifically, will it involve secure coding practices for the source code base? Can you already now talk about which secure coding practices you use for the Python code base (or plan for the future), as this concerns me a bit ... simply just because my lack of knowledge of what best practices exist for crypto development in Python.

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 14:57:23 GMT):<br/>
@turmewr3ck, re docker: we want to support docker but haven't had the bandwidth to look at it for a while. Patches would be welcome.

Re. Engage Identity, this work is absolutely going to benefit Indy, although some of what they're analyzing (e.g., governance) is specific to Sovrin's instantiation of Indy code. Here are a couple links that will show you some early thinking on these topics. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kv2SCsd-24iQPXjzutCQluTOGWWvbCKdUOqe-cISfq0/edit and https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kRCbPk3zB0qR5WOkgjUJXwD1pzYZCI0jDjqiwKhZkxs/edit?usp=sharing

Hi, Indy team.  I created a shared calendar for all Hyperledger community meetings. You can find it here: http://bit.ly/HyperledgerCal. Use the &ctz=_TZ_ option to specify your time zone. See the TZ column for list of options: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List.  I would really love to add any Indy meetings to this calendar.

@nage The idea was that all issues found in the shakedowns would be reported on this channel. Perhaps a summary of the issue could be posted as well. And interested folks could also go to the provided Jira link for more info.

That is good.  It is just confusing to have a stream of links without and context (perhaps a short message saying, here is what is going on would suffice).

Sometimes I'm receiving timeouts when using indy-sdk to send commands to the ledger. I mean I call the indy-sdk API and I never receive the callback. I don't have any more information at this point and can't tell whether it's an issue with my node, with indy-sdk, or with my java wrapper. I'll try to narrow down the problem, or maybe it's solved already with more recent versions. Just wanted to mention this, I'll let you know if I find out more.

I am looking for a list of emails for the maintainers of Hyperledger Indy. I did not see anything in the source code. Does this exist somewhere that you can point me to? I would like to send an email to the maintainers of Hyperledger Indy without using the mailing list at lists.hyperledger.org.

I don't think we have such a list as text in the code (yet).  I have logged it as https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-387
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Fri, 07 Jul 2017 02:09:45 GMT):<br/>
For now you can send email to @danielhardman, @stevetolman, @nage or @farooq_m_khan and we'll make sure it gets to the right folks.

@channel We will be implementing a very basic mechanism (we don't want to  spend more than 1.5 dev days to finish this) to store timestamps in the ledger. The ticket for that is https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-353, it mentions the design that we will be implementing (it's same as bitcoin), please raise any concerns if you disagree with the design

@channel ATTENTION! Our DEB (and pypi) packages were renamed! 
python3-plenum -> indy-plenum
python3-anoncreds -> indy-anoncreds
sovrin-node -> indy-node

A new package 'sovrin' was introduced. It depends on indy-node and just replaces indy-node's genesis transaction files with sovrin ones.

Our final deliverable is sovrin. Please update your environments to install sovrin package instead of sovrin-node.

Cross-posting from #indy-agent: we've been invited to create a logo for indy. I am going to attach the guidelines and then one pair of candidate logos (.svg, .png). Feel free to comment or to run wild with your own ideas.

Is there information anywhere that clearly describes how the anoncreds functionality works?  I've been working on the .NET wrapper and porting tests so I think I'm starting to get the idea, but it would be nice if there were some tutorial information explaining how each of the functions exposed by the SDK are intended to be used together.
</p>
<p><strong>srottem</strong> (Tue, 25 Jul 2017 18:35:16 GMT):<br/>
I'm also pretty unclear on what the various elements of the JSON  used in claim offers, claim attributes, claim schema, etc. represent (some are clear, but others are pretty opaque.  Any pointers to where this information can be uncovered would be very welcome.

Hi there. As Steward for Sovrin, the company I'm working for is willing to put me on the task to contribute to https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-580
</p>
<p><strong>bendon</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 08:14:24 GMT):<br/>
Could the first step be having a JIRA account?
</p>
<p><strong>bendon</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 08:33:19 GMT):<br/>
I've figured I had to ask @nage for this...
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 12:04:41 GMT):<br/>
Hi Brendon. You would need a Linux Foundation ID to access Jira - you should be able to create an account here: https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/
</p>
<p><strong>bendon</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 12:34:21 GMT):<br/>
Hi. Got one. I believe I had to do so in order to signup in this chat.
</p>
<p><strong>bendon</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 12:34:51 GMT):<br/>
However, I'm still not asked for any Linux Foundation ID on JIRA...
</p>
<p><strong>bendon</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 12:35:42 GMT):<br/>
"Not a member? To request an account, please contact your JIRA administrators."
</p>
<p><strong>bendon</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 12:37:31 GMT):<br/>
I feel like I'm missing something there...
</p>
<p><strong>bendon</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 12:38:00 GMT):<br/>
I've signed up my Linux Foundation ID using Github.
</p>
<p><strong>bendon</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 12:38:32 GMT):<br/>
But now I wonder if I don't need to create a separate password!?
</p>
<p><strong>bendon</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 12:41:07 GMT):<br/>
now got a password for Linux F. ID, but can not pass the auth on JIRA with that...
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Fri, 04 Aug 2017 13:11:11 GMT):<br/>
Let me check...
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 14:48:22 GMT):<br/>
@bendon yes, you need to go to the identity link Sean shared earlier and add a password from the LF side in order to log into Jira (id doesn't use single sign on the same way some of the other services do)
</p>
<p><strong>bendon</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 14:50:44 GMT):<br/>
ThX @nage, but I had trouble as I could not define a password at all.
Only way I found was to change it, but this was requiring the old one which I never had!
Even the reset procedure was requesting me the old password! Did not make sense to me.
</p>
<p><strong>bendon</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 14:51:33 GMT):<br/>
However, I did retry to reset by never defiend password today from the login page, and it did not request my old one.
</p>
<p><strong>bendon</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 14:51:46 GMT):<br/>
After that, I've been able to log in JIRA.
</p>
<p><strong>bendon</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 14:53:21 GMT):<br/>
This could be a bug/feature in LF id portal, or between my chair and my keyboard.
</p>
<p><strong>bendon</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 14:53:31 GMT):<br/>
I may try to reproduce it later...
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Mon, 07 Aug 2017 14:54:28 GMT):<br/>

(my opinion) if it is technical and really about the codebase and the contents of Indy I think this is the place. Now, the #indy-sdk or #indy-agent channels here on Rocket.Chat may be more focused?

Just watched Phil Windley's talk at Blockchain Utah and he mentioned premium claims and consent receipts.  Is there detail on how these work on the Sovrin network?
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 13 Sep 2017 12:33:02 GMT):<br/>
Premium claims are a branch of verifiable claims for which there will be economic exchange. We're deep in the process of figuring that out. Consent receipts are also still deep in the design process—we want to harmonize with the Kantara consent receipt work.

@bendon that leads into a topic we're pondering about on a project. Here's my take on your question: The DIDs and DDOs that are written to the ledger are immutable (i.e. they can't be changed). That means you need to be able to build your system so it can look at a history and I'll use a Verifiable Claim as an example. Let's say a company was issued a water permit. We have an Issuer (government), an Issuee (the company), and a DDO version of a claim that can be verified as signed by the Issuer and held by the Issuee.  
</p>
<p><strong>darrell.odonnell</strong> (Wed, 20 Sep 2017 11:28:35 GMT):<br/>
That can't be changed. But a future revocation could occur. Let's say the company violates a rule and the government needs to issue a revocation of the original claim. That's where it's currently stumping us.
</p>
<p><strong>darrell.odonnell</strong> (Wed, 20 Sep 2017 11:29:04 GMT):<br/>
For connections (e.g. a DID-to-DID relationship) it is easier - just delete them from your wallet and don't respond on the endpoint that is provided. 
</p>

For connections (e.g. a DID-to-DID relationship) it is easier - just delete them from your wallet and don't respond on the endpoint that is provided. The record will always be there but if you use a unique DID every time there is no correlation risk.
</p>
<p><strong>darrell.odonnell</strong> (Wed, 20 Sep 2017 11:30:03 GMT):<br/>
So - back to the Verifiable Claim Revocation. I am curious where the best current thinking is here? We're going to likely build a small open-source Python library to handle parts of this.  @drummondreed @windley @nage

At present, claim revocation is not implemented.
There are a few ways to tackle this kind of thing, for different requirements:
(1) make a claim that such and such was permitted at such and such a time, and then the client side policy is responsible for maximum age. E.g., this company is LEED certified. If the company fails to keep it up, don't re-issue.
(2) make rotating short-duration claims; again, it is up to the client side policy what to accept. E.g., a passport is fine as ID until expiry, but country XYZ requires it to be valid 6 months after arrival for entry
(3) have claim issuers available for agents to make claim requests in the moment
(4) revocation of claims, as yet not implemented.

#1-#2 are like the attribute certificate Push model, and #3 is like OCSP or the attribute certificate Pull model. #4 is not a great fit for claims whose truth values toggle back and forth such as suspension or duty rotation.

Note that there are way more claim definitions available than attributes (because of predicates) and way more attributes than certificates. In this chaos menagerie, each claim can have its own meaning and own freshness/validity in client policy, and so some kind of profile will be advantageous. This effort risks mimicking the generational struggle to define a decent role engineering framework, which in real systems becomes a rat's nest in a hurry.

The above is a hasty and partial consideration of a difficult and multivariate problem.

Good summaries.  Revocation work has designed and some signs of it are in the code base.  Classic revocation involves a pointer in the claim that a verifier can check to see if the claim is in a list of revoked credentials.  Unfortunately this can expose who has been revoked and when they were revoked.  The accumulator-based revokation approach outlined in the Anoncreds paper instead adds a number on the ledger, that along with a nonrevocation proof allows the holder to prove nonrevocation without disclosing which claim belongs to them.  Mechanically the trickiest part of this revocation scheme is how to replicate the "tails files" from the issuer to the holder, as this tails list is usually very large.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 20 Sep 2017 12:48:47 GMT):<br/>
as for approach #3 from @sklump, if you allow direct contact with the issuer, you create correlation exposure that reveals when and where a credential is being used, and in some cases this traffic can be observed even outside the relationships (for example, the DMV should not know when your drivers license is used to check your age).  The other approaches should be leveraged as appropriate,  I especially agree that well crafted expiry criteria should be used to avoid he expense of revocation where possible.  @danielhardman any more thoughts?

@Sean_Bohan and @sklump this may make an interesting discussion for the Agent WG meeting Thursday 
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 20 Sep 2017 13:30:15 GMT):<br/>
Revocation of a claim is not tantamount to revocation of a 'who' - maybe one of the predicates in the claim is no longer true; e.g., favourite drink changed. In any case, I don't think revocation of a claim is sensitive info in and of itself. Disclaimer - I come from PKI land, if revocation lists were confidential then they would be encrypted and not just signed. Libindy revocation as roughed in at present does not carry a reason - heck, the issuer node itself could be shut down on compromise, hence all claims revoked and no slight to entities in claims.

I don't understand what it is to which "tails files" refer in this context.

</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 21 Sep 2017 17:19:17 GMT):<br/>
The indy-anoncreds repo is the richest place to find info. See, for example, https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-anoncreds/blob/master/docs/anoncred-usecase0.pdf. The code in this repo implements math in the paper.

There is also some crypto work in indy-sdk (which is just now being moved into its own repo, indy-crypto). The indy-sdk/indy-crypto version of the code is newer and uses AMCL/milagro instead of charm as its foundation; eventually it will replace the python code. It also uses type 3 pairings instead of the older type 1 math.

Regarding crypto validation: I recommend that you contact Dmitry Khovratovich at the University of Luxembourg, who wrote the papers. I know that Jan Camenisch (his collaborator and the father of many of the techniques embodied by this code) has some correctness proofs for some of his work, but I don't know if it applies to all, part, or none of the work in this specific code. Dmitry will know, or Jan will.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 21 Sep 2017 17:20:45 GMT):<br/>
Jan and others on the IBM research team in Zurich are just preparing to collaborate on the indy-crypto repo, now that it's broken out into its own place and framed in a way that could be used more broadly within Hyperledger.

Are there any ETA on when Indy will be "released"? 
</p>
<p><strong>neeps</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 16:53:58 GMT):<br/>
+ is indy by itself a complete blockchain product? or is it primarily for delivering identity components to existing blockchain projects?
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 27 Sep 2017 18:00:49 GMT):<br/>
indy implements a distributed ledger, which nodes on a/the 'plenum' read and write. A distributed ledger is not a blockchain: it requires authorization to write, rather than proof of work.

@neeps: Indy has already been released once, in a sense: there is a production network running it (the Sovrin network, which launched July 31, 2017). This was the "Aires" release of Sovrin, and Indy's version numbers were incremented to 1.0 at that time, after a year of preparation and growth. There is likely to be another watershed moment for Indy in a few months, when Sovrin achieves other maturation goals. I don't know how Indy version numbers will change at that time.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 28 Sep 2017 17:11:36 GMT):<br/>
In about 1-2 months, the Indy SDK (not Indy proper, but the libraries that make it easy to use Indy) are hoping for an "Argon" refresh.

@WadeBarnes 
It's a known issue we've been working on. The current build in master is broken becauase of new dependencies for indy-crypto. It will be fixed soon. 
I will let you know once it's fixed (should be really soon, waiting for PRs being built)
Sorry for inconvenience
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 28 Sep 2017 17:17:52 GMT):<br/>
@WadeBarnes 
The master build should work now, but there is a known problem that it uses wrong version of indy-crypto dependency (it will be fixed in 5 minutes).
Also, as a workaround, one can use a Stable version (stable repo instead of master)
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 28 Sep 2017 18:22:07 GMT):<br/>
The new build indy-node 1.1.149 (master) should be fine 
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Thu, 28 Sep 2017 18:32:42 GMT):<br/>
@ashcherbakov

folks, have a question here about connecting to the test network - 

I have been able to SSH to the server, but I am unable to utilize vagrant to connect to the cli01. I get the following error:
agent@agent01:~$ vagrant ssh cli01

The program 'vagrant' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:

sudo apt install vagrant

This is the first step under the Setting Up a CLI Client and Configuring Agents in the Sovrin Cluster section of the GSG. What do I need to do differently?

<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 08:03:40 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt so what happens after you install vagrant?
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 08:42:14 GMT):<br/>
@lovesh : I did not try. I was told to start at the section that does the connect. I did not want to do anything before finding out whether I should try that. So it sounds like the test network machines are not set up yet. Is that correct?
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 08:42:14 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 08:43:08 GMT):<br/>
Ok, you need to install vagrant by `sudo apt install vagrant`
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 08:44:10 GMT):<br/>
Are you following this https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-environments/blob/master/vagrant/training/vb-multi-vm/TestSovrinClusterSetup.md ?
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 08:47:17 GMT):<br/>
Okay. I was told to start here: https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-environments/blob/master/vagrant/training/vb-multi-vm/TestSovrinClusterSetup.md#setting-up-a-cli-client-and-configuring-the-agents-in-the-sovrin-cluster. Can you provide the link for where I should start for these test machines?
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 08:47:52 GMT):<br/>
So same document, but part way through. Should I start at the beginning?
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 08:49:58 GMT):<br/>
yes, i would like to give you an overview of what is happening, you are trying to connect to a machine running the cli which will talk to some other machines running agents and validators, but first you need all those machines set up, doing `vagrant up` does that
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 08:55:03 GMT):<br/>
Okay. That is great. I can definitely do that. Just didn't realize I needed to. Thanks for your help. I am sure there will be a ton of interest on this channel today from the folks here at the Hackathon. There is a lot of interest in identity

@Benudek @Sean_Bohan 

How to start working with indy sdk on MacOS (if you have no access to ubuntu or windows environment) with python:

1. Understand that libindy python package is actually a wrapper for the native libindy library. For MacOS we don’t have a binary package and you need to build libindy from source code.
2. Clone «rc» branch from https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/rc
3. Build libindy.dylib (native lindy-sdk library) with the following instruction: https://github.com/bdot/indy-sdk/blob/cd0df217fcb4f366143816c8b023410382213c74/doc/mac-build.md
4. Make sure that processes can load ibindy.dylib. Usually, you need to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH env var looking to the path that contains libindy.dylib (you can find it in libindy/target/debug)
5. Make sure you have access to Indy Pool. Actually, you have 2 options:
- Run pool (on 127.0.0.1 ip address) in Docker with https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/rc/ci/indy-pool.dockerfile docker file:
docker build -f ci/indy-pool.dockerfile -t indy_pool .
docker run -itd -p 9701-9709:9701-9709 indy_pool
Note that we bind 9701-9709 ports from docker to local ports. I have no direct experience with Docker on Mac, so make sure that it works this way.
- Use our test pool. See #gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xo3Q43TDrrPxwWds7ZtwgPHjU2SfLlMpj9VdKXYck1o/edit#gid=0
4. Look to python sample: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/rc/samples/python. This sample uses python3-indy package from pypi. Make sure that you use the latest stable version without rc or build number suffixes.
5. Connection to pool requires genesis txn file that describes some initial nodes transaction. This sample is already pre-configured to work with pool in docker. If you need to connect to the different pool you need to change node transactions in the method «pool_genesis_txn_data» in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/rc/samples/python/src/utils.py file.
6. This sample explains the main libindy usage workflows. So i suggest to look to main.py and find demos to all API parts.

For Windows and Ubuntu you can find libindy build instructions here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/README.md. Also, there are pre-built packages for windows and ubuntu in repo: https://repo.evernym.com/libindy. Use stable versions.

> _je_malloc_usable_size

Looks like you have no jemalloc on your system. I suggest the following:

1. Check that you installed rust with instruction from #1 point
2. You can try to disable jemalloc and use system default allocator isntead. Just add the following lines to the top of libindy/lib.rs file:

#![feature(alloc_system)]
extern crate alloc_system;
</p>

You can try to force install jemalloc with the following instruction: https://gist.github.com/zonomasa/481b7534594414b47723

But it is much better to install latest stable Rust compiler and cargo with official instruction.
</p>
<p><strong>gudkov</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 18:01:15 GMT):<br/>
@Benudek Also you can try to rebut your system.

<p><strong>Benudek</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 20:20:37 GMT):<br/>
it seems to me I need to first install all of this? somehow maybe your version numbers are not correct here?
</p>
<p><strong>Benudek</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 20:20:50 GMT):<br/>
so am thinking of installing them all manually
</p>
<p><strong>devin-fisher</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 20:31:13 GMT):<br/>
I'm coming into this behind but do you know what repository you are targeting? Those version number don't look right for stable. They may be right for master? Is that what you want?

<p><strong>Benudek</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 20:31:49 GMT):<br/>

How to start working with indy sdk on MacOS (if you have no access to ubuntu or windows environment) with python:

1. Understand that libindy python package is actually a wrapper for the native libindy library. For MacOS we don’t have a binary package and you need to build libindy from source code.
2. Clone «rc» branch from https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/rc
3. Build libindy.dylib (native lindy-sdk library) with the following instruction: https://github.com/bdot/indy-sdk/blob/cd0df217fcb4f366143816c8b023410382213c74/doc/mac-build.md
4. Make that processes can load ibindy.dylib. Usually, you need to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH env var looking to the path that contains libindy.dylib (you can find it in libindy/target/debug)
5. Make sure you have access to Indy Pool. Actually, you have 2 options:
- Run pool (on 127.0.0.1 ip address) in Docker with https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/rc/ci/indy-pool.dockerfile docker file:
docker build -f ci/indy-pool.dockerfile -t indy_pool .
docker run -itd -p 9701-9709:9701-9709 indy_pool
Note that we bind 9701-9709 ports from docker to local ports. I have no direct experience with Docker on Mac, so make sure that it works this way.
- Use our test pool. See #gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xo3Q43TDrrPxwWds7ZtwgPHjU2SfLlMpj9VdKXYck1o/edit#gid=0
4. Look to python sample: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/rc/samples/python. This sample uses python3-indy package from pypi. Make sure that you use the latest stable version without rc or build number suffixes.
5. Connection to pool requires genesis txn file that describes some initial nodes transaction. This sample is already pre-configured to work with pool in docker. If you need to connect to the different pool you need to change node transactions in the method «pool_genesis_txn_data» in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/rc/samples/python/src/utils.py file.
6. This sample explains the main libindy usage workflows. So i suggest to look to main.py and find demos to all API parts.

For Windows and Ubuntu you can find libindy build instructions here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/README.md. Also, there are pre-built packages for windows and ubuntu in repo: https://repo.evernym.com/libindy. Use stable versions.

</p>
<p><strong>Benudek</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 20:39:54 GMT):<br/>
ok, can you give a new one soon? or just tell me what to change? I can edit locally
</p>
<p><strong>devin-fisher</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 20:40:11 GMT):<br/>
I can give you the latest version in stable?

<p><strong>devin-fisher</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 21:11:17 GMT):<br/>

am btw also trying following the getting started guide with setting up a local network with vagrant, one should work I guess ... :-) I prefer the docker, it looks easier
</p>
<p><strong>devin-fisher</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 21:13:15 GMT):<br/>
rocket chat don't like .dockerfile I guess. Added .txt at the end and it took it.

<p><strong>Benudek</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 21:16:03 GMT):<br/>
yes, ran it seems fine. continuing the steps, thanks a lot !
</p>
<p><strong>devin-fisher</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 21:16:25 GMT):<br/>
yeah no problem. Sorry its been a pain.

<p><strong>Benudek</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 21:17:30 GMT):<br/>
no worries, its great software

- Use our test pool. See #gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xo3Q43TDrrPxwWds7ZtwgPHjU2SfLlMpj9VdKXYck1o/edit#gid=0

I cant make too much out of these things here though ... :-)
</p>
<p><strong>Benudek</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 21:17:58 GMT):<br/>
why would I use the test pool if I have a local dockerfile?
</p>
<p><strong>Benudek</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 21:19:20 GMT):<br/>
and how can I use the python now? I think I install it locally and then via pool_genesis_txn_data it connects the running docker image?
</p>
<p><strong>devin-fisher</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 21:24:26 GMT):<br/>
sorry, I came into the middle of the conversation. What is your end goal right at the moment. The docker file stands up a local indy network. A network you can connect to with the indy-sdk.  But it looks like based on the spreed sheet that someone setup a indy network for the hackfest? 
</p>
<p><strong>Benudek</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 21:25:33 GMT):<br/>
yes, but we didnt het the vagrant up
</p>
<p><strong>Benudek</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 21:25:48 GMT):<br/>
thats why we diverted to docker, so not sure why this file is in here/
</p>
<p><strong>Benudek</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 21:26:22 GMT):<br/>
I just need instructions how to now interact with that docker image, which is running. have this pythin code local and that connects to my docker then?
</p>
<p><strong>devin-fisher</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 21:28:37 GMT):<br/>
you should be ready to connect to the network.
</p>
<p><strong>Benudek</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 21:32:11 GMT):<br/>
I know, but how :-)

</p>
<p><strong>devin-fisher</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 21:45:18 GMT):<br/>
have you down loaded the sample/python code?
</p>
<p><strong>devin-fisher</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 21:46:30 GMT):<br/>
move into the src directory and run the main.py file.

journey continues ... ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>devin-fisher</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 22:16:19 GMT):<br/>
did you set the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the location of libindy.dylib that you built?
</p>
<p><strong>Benudek</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 22:19:22 GMT):<br/>
dont think so, not sure it was mentioned in setup steps
</p>
<p><strong>devin-fisher</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 22:21:06 GMT):<br/>
4. Make that processes can load ibindy.dylib. Usually, you need to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH env var looking to the path that contains libindy.dylib (you can find it in libindy/target/debug)
</p>
<p><strong>Benudek</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 22:21:25 GMT):<br/>

Verifier would be an NGO
</p>
<p><strong>Benudek</strong> (Sun, 01 Oct 2017 10:02:05 GMT):<br/>
and he would need that statement, when visiting authorities and hospitals in the country where (s)he seeks asylum.

<p><strong>Benudek</strong> (Sun, 01 Oct 2017 10:11:16 GMT):<br/>
could we have a necessary like: refugee gets a claim ' yes, I was vaccinated so I can pass the border' but he will NOT reveal his entire health records to the authorities?
</p>
<p><strong>Benudek</strong> (Sun, 01 Oct 2017 10:11:20 GMT):<br/>

yes, actually ideally we would get some help to adjust anoncreds to a situation where a refugee claims to the country where he seeked asylum that he has a certain vaccination. NGO approves the claim and the refugee gets that claim to pass the border without revealing the entire health history

Hi Guys, a newbie question. Need some help in understanding few things. If we want to use customer's fingerprint to authenticate user on Indy. Do we need to manage an intermediate system to maintain a link b/w Sovrin identity & Fingerprint or can we store fingerprint itself to Indy/Sovrin ledger. Thanks for your time.
</p>
<p><strong>bendon</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 09:30:51 GMT):<br/>
I'll give a newbie answer: I would sue who ever store my fingerprint even on a private server :-p
</p>
<p><strong>bendon</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 09:32:00 GMT):<br/>
Now, I bet there are ways to not store the fingerprint data itself, but something that prooves I've got this fingerprint under my finger :-p
</p>
<p><strong>bendon</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 09:32:54 GMT):<br/>
But I'm curious about a better and more accurate answer to your question
</p>
<p><strong>bdot</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 10:06:40 GMT):<br/>
@bendon Ha ha, Agree with you. I know it's not a good to store finger print. 
</p>
<p><strong>bdot</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 10:06:45 GMT):<br/>
But what if we can have finger print as private key and store public key of it in ledger. Then how can we make sure others can not correlate my identity based on public key. I don't know, hope one of the experts can help.
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 11:33:39 GMT):<br/>
@bdot You can use the hash of the biometric + nonce to generate the keypair where the nonce can be treated as an application specific id, so for app1, Alice uses `hash(biometric||app1_id)` (as seed) to generate keypair and for app2, Alice uses `hash(biometric||app2_id)` to generate keypair. When authenticating from app1, the app takes Alice's biometric, hashes it with app id and does the signature which can be verified against the key on the ledger. Thus the ledger has these 2 pieces of data for Alice, keys generated using `hash(biometric||app1_id)` and `hash(biometric||app2_id)` but nobody looking at the ledger can guess that biometric in both keys is same. This works nicely in theory but the reality is that biometrics are "noisy" and hash functions do not tolerate noise

<p><strong>jamesmonaghan</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 14:20:16 GMT):<br/>
yeah there are some folks doing that. the guys at iRespond, for example
</p>
<p><strong>jamesmonaghan</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 14:24:07 GMT):<br/>
in general i'd say you don't want to derive identifiers or keys directly from a biometric, because you cant change it in future
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Tue, 03 Oct 2017 14:34:01 GMT):<br/>
Yes, biometrics have some special security concerns, so t is usually best to use them as a secondary factor (like a seed to generate a key or a recovery mechanism for unlocking a recovery key).  Indy has he advantage of being able to isolate these biometrics to just your identity wallet and agents, which prevents folks from assembling a database of biometrics to compromise, but it is very important to be careful with this data (even templated biometrics), as you cannot rotate these secrets if they are compromised.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 16:15:05 GMT):<br/>
A question about the plantuml use cases (sequence diagrams) that were posted recently.

Our assumption is that a common use case for something like a proof request/response is that it will be an online web interaction - e.g. on the order of seconds with the user typically waiting.  In our toy sandbox, we are seeing times from the unit tests that are MUCH longer than that - 60/90 seconds in some cases.

Is it safe for us to assume that's an anomaly, and that we need not build in complication for handling an elongated User Experience based on what we are seeing right now?  When we get into the "real world", all will be Fast (or at least, fast enough)?
</p>
<p><strong>darrell.odonnell</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 17:16:36 GMT):<br/>
@nage any thoughts on @swcurran 's comments here?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Fri, 06 Oct 2017 19:11:58 GMT):<br/>
There is some computation involved in calculating and issuing claims, but I don't think it should take quite that long.  @ashcherbakov what would be a good "time to generate a claim" and "time to generate a proof" guideline?  Are we aware of bugs in that code or tickets around optimization?  (I know we have been working to move the python implementation over to the SDK in order to use better, more efficient libraries).

I'm less concerned about current performance than about expectations for Sovrin in production. Do we think (vs. hope) that HL-Indy/Sovrin will have "online response" times or should we be designing user interactions to assume delays?

<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 07:46:50 GMT):<br/>
@nage @swcurran @darrell.odonnell 
The only thing that may take quite long time is generation of keys (claim defs) by the issuer. That's because of we use some special primes, and calculation of these primes may take time. I think it's ok for this generation, because it's on the Issuer side only, and should be done only once before we isssue any claims (no request-response involved).
All other things such as claim request / issue claim, or proof request / generate proof / verification of proof should work pretty fast. And they do work pretty fast in all our tests (both libindy and python anoncreds).
Do you face the problems with generation of Issuer keys, or with other parts of the workflow?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 12:43:13 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran beyond Alex’s question, it is a good idea to expect agent interactions to take time and be asynchronous.  This allows agents to tolerate downtime, making them more resilient in important ways, but also allows the humans behind them to stay involved with permissioning and authorizing responses where it is important to them.  I know that isn’t really directly related to your question, but from a philosophy perspective the ideal would enable two agents on bad “remote location” connections to interact without timeouts and intermittent connectivity preventing any progress (it would be slow and painful, but the hope is it would still work)
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 12:44:47 GMT):<br/>
It also lowers the minimum uptime requirement so that it is realistic to host an agent in your home, or somewhere remote in cases where trust issues prevent doing otherwise.
</p>
<p><strong>darrell.odonnell</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 11:26:29 GMT):<br/>
@nage agreed on the asynch approach. We're just starting synchronous to allow one of the systems that we have to run synch for now. As a longer-term approach we totally agree.

hello what's currently the recommended way to install the sovrin/indy CLI ?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 08:30:49 GMT):<br/>
As of now CLI is part of indy-node (and sovrin). So, you shoule install sovrin:

apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 68DB5E88
apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys BD33704C
echo "deb https://repo.evernym.com/deb xenial stable" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
echo "deb https://repo.sovrin.org/deb xenial stable" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
 apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y sovrin

Please note that this CLI doesn't use indy-sdk yet.

The sovrin installation no longer requires the evernym repo, so the second key can be omitted, and the repo.evernym.com  does not need to be added.

Can anyone explain the following:

1) I have the Indy source installed on two Ubuntu machines.
        I can run a node like this
        
        $ init_indy_keys --name Alpha [--seed 111111111111111111111111111Alpha] [--force]
        Running Node
        
        $ start_indy_node Alpha 9701 9702
        
        So why are their two port parameters, I understand the names are called nodestack and clientstack
        but have no idea what intrinsically that means?


2) On the other machine I can start Indy client.

        #indy
        Indy-CLI (c) 2017 Evernym, Inc.
        Type 'help' for more information.
        Running Indy 1.1
        
        indy> status
        Not connected to Indy network. Please connect first.
        
        Usage:
            connect <test|live>
        
        indy> 

  Thats great. But how does it know of any nodes and connections?

Pretty basic questions but the read on the github seems to have part of the conversation missing.

</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 16:20:43 GMT):<br/>
I am more familiar with the python Indy installation, but the concepts should be the same.  The "Alpha" argument is an alias (name) that the node is known as on the ledger. It will be used in logging, etc.  9701 is the (configurable) port that will be bound to for incoming communications from other validators, consensus messages and the like.  9702 is the (configurable) port that agents and client use to connect to the Indy node.
</p>
<p><strong>redpath</strong> (Fri, 13 Oct 2017 16:22:11 GMT):<br/>
so Essentially the node has two ports to speak

Does anyone have any documentation  how to setup this infrastructure, since I can create Indy Nodes and I can run an Indy-CLI. All I am finding is doc that says here is a test example download (Vagrant) all of this and you can do Alice commands and such to speak the story that is documented. Seems quite vague at this point how these running pieces know of each other. Sure I want a Fabric College (node?) and sure I want graduate of that College (Client) to enable a future employer (client) to verify the credentials for the applicant future employee. Anything would be helpful, I find nothing really on Sovrin and Indy GIT areas that is of any help in this area. Not being negative here just trying to figure it out from nothing of documentation other than walk this mile of a demo and then what

The DID/DDO story is really the base of everything and a brief summary might be the DID is a unique identifier while the DDO is a record of information about that identifier.  DDOs are persisted somewhere central that they can be accessed and are indexed by the DID they were created for. DIDs can be recorded locally and can be exchanged with others - if I give you my DID you can look up my DDO from where it's stored and get information about my DID that allow you to determine where you can send me messages, what public key you can encrypt them with and information to allow you to verify that messages send to you were actually sent by the party that controls that DID .  In the Sovrin environment DIDs and DDOs are stored on the Sovrin distributed ledger.

Does anybody know how/where I can retrieve the <ref-no-of-SCHEMA-txn> to send GET_CLAIM_DEF. For instance, for the Transcript issued by Faber College in Alice demo?
I've been hexdumping client, agent and node files without any luck.
I see a "ref" field related to the claim_def of Transcript in domain_transactions_sandbox/000003.log, but can not get anything else than "Claim def not found" while using decimal conversion from what I guess are those ref number...
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 19 Oct 2017 10:45:42 GMT):<br/>
<ref-no-of-SCHEMA-txn>  is a sequence number (unique id) of a txn as it exusts in the Ledger.
You can get it by examining the corresponding SCHEMA txn in the ledger (there seqNo field there).
CLI can also be used to get this information:
`send GET_SCHEMA dest=<DID of Schema Issuer> name=<Schema name> version=<Schema Version>`

I don't see any seq number there!?
</p>
<p><strong>bendon</strong> (Thu, 19 Oct 2017 11:49:39 GMT):<br/>
No clue how I can read this seqNo directly from the ledger: in which file should I look at (if not domain_transactions_sandbox/000003.log)?
</p>
<p><strong>bendon</strong> (Thu, 19 Oct 2017 12:09:08 GMT):<br/>
Found seqNo=18 on client side, in .sovrin/data/clients/<xxx>/Requests/<yyy><zzz>, and it sounds like matching the ref field I fount on the ledger side (ref=0x12). But still not getting any output:
Alice@test> send GET_CLAIM_DEF ref=18 signature_type=CL
Getting claim def 18
Claim def not found

</p>

On a Node, you can run `read_ledger --type=domain`  (run this script from 'indy' user (or 'sovrin', depending on whether you use a version without rebranding chnages)
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 19 Oct 2017 12:44:42 GMT):<br/>
I was thinking that GET_SCHEMA returns seqNo. If not, then probably it's a missing featyre that needs to be fixed

</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 19 Oct 2017 12:46:01 GMT):<br/>
I will create a ticket for this
</p>
<p><strong>bendon</strong> (Thu, 19 Oct 2017 12:46:56 GMT):<br/>
Thx: I'll try to read_ledger to check I've got the right seqNo.
Meanwhile: do you know if GET_CLAIM_DEF works as expected?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 19 Oct 2017 12:48:28 GMT):<br/>
Yes, it should work
</p>
<p><strong>bendon</strong> (Thu, 19 Oct 2017 12:50:51 GMT):<br/>
Aside of this, I bet it would also make sense if "show connection <name>" would also display the version of the available claims (only the name shows up in 1.1.33). Because version is required for the client to GET_SCHEMA.
</p>
<p><strong>bendon</strong> (Thu, 19 Oct 2017 12:51:53 GMT):<br/>
Without this, user needs to look directly in the client wallet to get the version
</p>
<p><strong>bendon</strong> (Thu, 19 Oct 2017 13:04:15 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=bGJ8iWLhJmLC95vAf) @ashcherbakov read_ledger works, and give me the transaction ordered in sequence I guess (starting from 10). But GET_CLAIM_DEF gives nothing using either the seqNo of the claim_def or the related shema. Neither using the reqId of those both!
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 19 Oct 2017 13:19:45 GMT):<br/>
@bendon ok, I think I see the issue. As of now, GET_CLAIM_DEF command can return CLAIM_DEF issued by the sender (current DID in the CLI) only. This also needs to be fixed.
There is ORIGIN field in GET_CLAIM_DEF request, and CLI always uses current sender's DID for it. In fact, ORIGIN must be provided explicitly. 
I will create a ticket for this as well.

</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 19 Oct 2017 13:20:21 GMT):<br/>
In the meantime, if you can `use DID` of CLAIM_DEF's issuer in CLI, and send GET_CLAIM_DEF, then it should return correct result
</p>
<p><strong>bendon</strong> (Thu, 19 Oct 2017 13:24:57 GMT):<br/>
Good catch: it works when using the right DID
</p>

I have the Sovrin Alice demo working nicely but just had a minor source question for what is most recent.

I am using code
  git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node.git
  git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-anoncreds.git

All work fine and this code has recent dates shown when viewing the list.

I noticed there is a
   https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-environments.git
with code shown with dates 1 month and some 5 days ago and  a
  https://github.com/evernym/sovrin.git
which has code dates of a year old.

So the question is, the code I am using is that correct and appropriate? Seems most up to date.

Who do I need to contact to create a Repo under Hyperledger project called
hyperledger/indy-tutorial-sandbox

The purpose of this Repo is to provide

A turn-key docker based sandbox that enables quick and easy exploration of Hyperledger Indy concepts.
This devops repo can be used to gather hands-on experience of Indy basics using the scenarios outlined in the [Sovrin’s Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/stable/getting-started.md).

Or better yet how do I join so I can create this Repo.

<p><strong>nbrempel</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:04:14 GMT):<br/>
Hi @redpath there are a few examples available in this repo: https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-environments.  I'm currently working on adding another example that requires less setup and can start the Alice example in one command
</p>
<p><strong>nbrempel</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:05:12 GMT):<br/>

The main purpose of agreement is transaction ordering. The Primary rules the ordering, and other nodes come to consensus if they agree (in particular, if they ledgers and states are equal, that is roots of Merkle Trees (ledger) are equal and roots of Patricia Trie (state) are equal)

@sidhujag I am not an expert, but the ZKP tech used for exchanging verifiable claims with Indy is based on Camenisch-Lysyanskaya signatures. http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cis/pubs/lysyanskaya/cl02b.pdf 
</p>
<p><strong>sidhujag</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 19:08:34 GMT):<br/>
yes that is what I have read, from IBM. I wonder what that difference between that and using a trusted library like libsnark would be
</p>
<p><strong>sidhujag</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 19:08:47 GMT):<br/>

Hello
I have a quick question, when developing a solution with Indy, are privacy policies for a given business use case setup using the schema that the node provides?
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Mon, 06 Nov 2017 20:04:14 GMT):<br/>
That's a great question. Since the verifiable claims will often be exchanged agent-to-agent, it's the privacy policies of the Verifier that normally reply. The Issuer of the claim usually can't dictate the privacy policies of the Verifier (and the Holder of the claim usually can't either). See the Verifiable Claims Primer, https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-fall2017/blob/master/draft-documents/verifiable-claims-primer.md.

The way Hyperledger process works (at least from what we've observed so far) it is a lot easier to add to an existing repo than to have a new one created.  In order to help the release branches of the code in sync it may be better to add it to an existing repo (that way each branch can track changes to keep things compatible), but that isn't always possible.  Is there a place in the current repo that would make sense?  We are also looking at consolidating the sovrin-environments code into the indy-node and indy-sdk code bases, so perhaps these sorts of examples and tutorials could be placed in-line as well?  I'm looking to the fabric repository as an example of this, but we're open to other suggestions.  @tkuhrt do you have any recommendations on what works best?

Well maybe give it a try as a repo it is very small though quite elegant, simply run a makefile and your ready to go with a Indy demo that works for you without all the setup processes. 
</p>
<p><strong>nbrempel</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 18:46:11 GMT):<br/>
@redpath do you have the tutorial repo hosted anywhere currently? I'd love to take a look at it for my own learning.
</p>
<p><strong>aaronr</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 19:01:30 GMT):<br/>
Reading the Alice scenario in the Getting Started guide I ran up against a question that I haven't been able to find an answer too.  In the guide it says, "Trust anchors provide a way for DIDs to be added to to the ledger. They are generally organizations but can be persons as well. Faber College is a trust anchor, and if its connection request is accepted, will write Alice’s DID to the ledger."  So from what I've been reading, only Validator Nodes can write to the ledger and they are run by the stewards on the network.  If this wording means that Fabor is a Trust Anchor and Trust Anchor = Steward, then enough said.  But if not, I'm curious to know the flow from Faber knowing that they have a DID to write to the ledger and it actually getting written to the ledger. 
</p>
<p><strong>aaronr</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 19:04:44 GMT):<br/>
For example, when a Trust Anchor is brought onboard (I assume by a validator) it could be that the anchor will get access to APIs with which to make requests of the validator node.  Is that what happens?  And if so, does the Trust Anchor have an established relationship with just that one Validator Node?  Or are requests to Validator Nodes load balanced in some way so that the request could potentially be handled by any of the Validator Nodes?
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 21:42:48 GMT):<br/>
@aaronr - You are right that only validator nodes can write to the ledger, which they themselves maintain.  This is the nature of distributed ledgers.  Such writes are done only when consensus is achieved among validator nodes, with 2/3 * N +1 of the validators agreeing to the transaction.

What triggers the transaction?  A request to the validator pool, via a client or an agent.  All such requests must be signed by the requesting party.  The signature is verified by the validators, and if the signature matches the DID and verification key of someone who is already on the ledger, who has a role that is sufficient to authorize that the transaction be placed onto the ledger, then the validators will perform the write.

A trust anchor is a role that has sufficient privileges to sign a transaction to place a customer's DID onto the ledger.

@nbrempel Let me see into that
</p>
<p><strong>aaronr</strong> (Tue, 07 Nov 2017 22:49:40 GMT):<br/>
@mgbailey - thank you for the great explanation.  The trust anchor part confuses me a little, however.  So any agent or client that has a sufficient role to successfully request writing to the ledger is a Trust Anchor?  Or is Trust Anchor a role above that?  So writing a DID to the ledger takes an even more specialized role?  I assume the Stewards determine who can be a Trusted Authority.  Is that true of all roles that a client or agent has?

On a similar note, are read requests handled in a similar manner from the observer nodes?  It is a pool of nodes that requests are made of by qualified agents or clients?

All roles can read without restriction.  To understand roles better, take a look at the "Sovrin Roles" appendix of [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kQcdICAYmSqbk4d5lUtFhk2L55dKJMfyM0JbZPeG55s/edit?usp=sharing)

@mgbailey I guess my team is looking for more specific details.  In the "real world", if I wanted to become an Trust Anchor of the production Sovrin network and be able to make a write request, how do I get the information that I need to do so?  Is all of this (validator pool address, API set) hidden from view in a CLI?  If so, is that CLI the standard CLI, or specialized software that a Steward would send to a Trust Anchor out of band as part of an onboarding process?  Or is it some other flow other than CLI to make a write request to the ledger?

<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Wed, 08 Nov 2017 16:26:28 GMT):<br/>
@aaronr Say "Acme GIzmos" wants to be a trust anchor and to establish its agent to be able to function in the Sovrin ecosystem.  Acme would need to reach out to a steward, who would vet Acme.  After agreeing that Acme should be a trust anchor, the steward would request a DID and verkey from Acme.  Acme would use a tool such as the Sovrin CLI to generate the DID and verkey, along with the corresponding private key.  It would store the private key in a secure location, and send the DID and verkey to the steward. The steward would write Acme's DID, verkey and the role (trust anchor) into a transaction on the ledger. 
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Wed, 08 Nov 2017 16:27:25 GMT):<br/>
@brycecurtis , thanks for sharing this.  I will give it a spin.
</p>
<p><strong>aaronr</strong> (Wed, 08 Nov 2017 17:04:10 GMT):<br/>
@mgbailey and then Acme would use the Sovrin CLI to "write to the ledger" (which would make the request to the pool of validator nodes that would then be voted on, authorized, and then written by a validator node).  The "write to the ledger" would be a command, or series of commands, like "add keys...." and "submit pending".  And the address of the pool and the actual api to request the writing is hidden from the CLI user.  Do I have that right?
</p>
<p><strong>nbrempel</strong> (Wed, 08 Nov 2017 17:12:56 GMT):<br/>
thank you very much @brycecurtis @redpath, I'm sure this will be very helpful!
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Wed, 08 Nov 2017 17:47:15 GMT):<br/>
@aaronr most likely Acme will set up an agent application to automate interactions with the ledger, rather than doing most actions with the CLI.  The CLI is handy for demonstration purposes, though.  You are correct that Acme would then be able to submit transactions to the ledger such as adding a NYM (i.e. DID and verkey) for a customer.  The validators will receive the transaction, see that it is signed by a valid trust anchor, vote on it, and put it on the ledger.

Hi All. Newb here. I'm getting through the EdX course on Hyperledger and am in my final year of college and am looking for my final year to create some blockchain-based college accreditation platform. Something akin to BlockCert and what Malta are doing, but smaller scale and using HyperLedger Indy as the platform.... so would anyone have tips on a decent source I could get stuck into? Many thanks

<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 08:23:02 GMT):<br/>
@notOccupanther this is certainly an interesting use case.  @mhailstone at BYU and a few others have been looking at university identity use cases for Verifiable Claims.  The BYU-OIT folks have a github repository with some interesting things to take a look at here https://github.com/BYU-OIT.  There are also some interesting things to compare on BlockCerts schemas that might be adapted into the Getting Started Guide's Alice example to produce a proof of concept.

@notOccupanther we're getting increasing interest from universities for things like qualifications, which would simply be verifiable claims. We can be MUCH more creative with student identity though, as universities could bootstrap students with a host of verifiable claims to help them in their future life. Student identity itself, faculty membership, course credits, exam results, library access, system access etc. All can be verifiable claims. So it's much more than the relatively simple "degree certificates on a blockchain" that blockcerts does. You could use Sovrin to create a portable student passport usable anywhere.

hi. i have a use case where i want to track blockchain users that have gone through a KYC or anti-money laundering process - only once they pass that are they trusted to perform transactions. is that the sort of thing Indy could help with? I'm using Sawtooth as my blockchain infrastructure, so it needs to be compatible with that...

</p>
<p><strong>jamesmonaghan</strong> (Thu, 09 Nov 2017 13:53:31 GMT):<br/>
the Sovrin ledger gives you a place to register decentralised identifiers (DIDs) for the users and the issuers of credentials, an the IndySDK gives you what you need to issue and validate Verifiable Claims to those users, digitally signed by the issuing party

Hi guys, not sure if this is the right chat for this question, but I’m following the indy install process, as documented here (https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-environments/blob/master/vagrant/training/vb-multi-vm/TestIndyClusterSetup.md). When I come to “Setting Up a CLI Client and Configuring the Agents in the Indy Cluster” and use vagrant to ssh into the cli01 host, and run “indy”, the “indy” binary is not found. Infact, the “indy” binary itself doesn’t seem to be installed on cli01 or any of the validator nodes. Other indy related artifacts are though. Perhaps I’m missing something or the guide is out of date (although it was updated 11 days ago). Can anyone point me in the right direction?

@AndrewTobin I agree with your points there.  I just intended this project to do two things.  1) Allow me to submit an interesting Thesis as my final year project (none of the contet was on the course, apart from some Python and Java, but the lecurers are ok with me working on it), and 2) get me started with a project that is Blockchain based, to learn as I go kind of thinng.   So in reality, if I ciould even just get a single transaction working, from DIT to Student and from student to claim his/her degree... that would be cool.  My project would still involve fleshing out the Software Engineering angle with Workflows, State Diags, legal considerations and implications etc ...

@nengine Hello.  Seems the docs are not good for all cases. We will update them asap.
For now, I can suggest the following steps to fix that
- run `sudo indy-node/scripts/create_dirs.sh` this will create file structure necessary for further pool initialization routine (as it is mentioned in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/indy-running-locally.md#requirements using virtual machine is highly recommended)
- use scripts from `indy-node/scripts` directory instead of available from the $PATH (i.e. `indy-node/scripts/generate_indy_pool_transactions`, `indy-node/scripts/start_indy_node`)

<p><strong>andkononykhin</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 15:46:13 GMT):<br/>
@nengine You can try local pool setup with workarounds that I suggested. Hopefully, it will work. As an option you could try vagrant way mentioned in getting started tutorial. BTW consider to check docs and code from master branch https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/getting-started.md. It includes a lot of fixes and more up-to-date docs and links. We will also try to make updates related to the issue you mentioned.

hi @mgbailey I was at the instructions, but found that it was refering to "Sovrin " network node.  If I setup vagrant, is to going to use code hyperledger/indy-node github repository?  thank a lot.
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 20:16:12 GMT):<br/>
@nengine If you are on the stable branch, it will say "sovrin".  If you are on the master branch, "sovrin" has been re-branded as "indy".  This confusion will die out soon, when we are ready to do the next release, and the master branch is promoted to stable.
</p>
<p><strong>nengine</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 20:29:17 GMT):<br/>

I've been reading around Indy for a day or two and roughly speaking I have wrapped my head around some aspects of it, but one question I need answering is this: Is Indy a DLT implementation itself, or rather does it require the services of a DLT as a "backend" for example Fabric?
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 22:28:49 GMT):<br/>
hi @theruss Indy Node is the codebase for a DLT, the first instantiation of it is the Sovrin DLT (currently provisional network). 
</p>
<p><strong>theruss</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 22:30:19 GMT):<br/>
Hi @Sean_Bohan and thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>theruss</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 22:31:33 GMT):<br/>
So if I, or my company, had a project that fit the bill of decentralised identity nearly perfectly, then am I right in thinking that an Indy Node setup, properly specced (in terms of project-specific business logic in chain code and the rest of it) would be another such instantiation?

</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 22:54:41 GMT):<br/>
Yes, you could always instantiate a new ledger using Indy code. Or your needs might just be served by an existing ledger that is able to provide the decentralized identity functionality you need, since if you want to preserve privacy, the actual on-ledger component of decentralized identity (the DIDs and DID docs and claims schemas) is pretty thin.

@andkononykhin I did vagrant setup and I was able to ssh into cli01 and when I run "vagrant@cli01:~$ indy" it says "-bash: indy: command not found". 
</p>
<p><strong>theruss</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 23:45:54 GMT):<br/>
@drummondreed thanks. My trouble in almost (but not quite) "getting it" for Indy, is that I've been doing the EDX course and so far it would seem that for Fabric, Sawtooth and Iroha, for a client project, one would "simply" (tm) spin-up a network of nodes within a cloud where say for argument's sake, each node were physically installed on a single VM and where the network comprise N such VMs.

My trouble in almost (but not quite) "getting it" for Indy, is that I've been doing the EDX course and so far it would seem that for Fabric, Sawtooth and Iroha, for a client project, one would "simply" (tm) spin-up a network of nodes within a cloud where say for argument's sake, each node were physically installed on a single VM and where the network comprised N such VMs.
</p>
<p><strong>theruss</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 23:47:06 GMT):<br/>
It might be worth noting that my company has its own cloud running OpenStack and it would be there, our POC project would be hosted and developed
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 23:48:20 GMT):<br/>
@theruss You could definitely do the same with Indy. @mgbailey is the guy to advise you more about that.
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 23:51:41 GMT):<br/>
@nengine, what was 'sovrin' is in the process of being rebranded to 'indy'.  If you are working in the stable branch, make sure that that is the branch you are using everywhere, including repo checkouts and instructions.  Then your terminology and commands will be consistent.
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 23:52:31 GMT):<br/>
Alternatively, for the newest (and perhaps less stable) stuff, use the master branch for everything
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 23:55:15 GMT):<br/>
Actually, I just found an error in a script that will make the master branch stuff fail...
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 23:59:23 GMT):<br/>
I am testing a fix to the vagrant scripts for the master branch, and will push it to the repo upon success
</p>
<p><strong>nengine</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 00:30:32 GMT):<br/>
ok, yes i was on stable and now switched to master and doing "vagrant up" again.  but will wait for your news changes.  thanks a lot.

I had to dig quite deep to understand that Indy itself only deals with the immutibility of transactions, DID references to DDOs and the management thereof. However; my remaining issue is with the actual storage of PPI (personal) data.
</p>
<p><strong>theruss</strong> (Tue, 14 Nov 2017 21:28:30 GMT):<br/>
In that for now obvious reasons, storing PPI data on a ledger, any ledger is bad idea. So the problem of "security" and immutibility of PPI data goes off-chain and becomes a problem of re-centralisation does it not?

Given that PPI data would probably need to be stored in a document DB or RDBMS somewhere, which is subject to all the problems that decentralisation promises to move us away from, how are the two states-of-affaird reconciled?

Off the top of my head, the DID and a public key could be stored against records, so what's the "reccomend" way to achieve this? How does Sovrin's implementation solve this?

I should add that the project I have in mind, will allow for frequent updating of PPI data such as name-changes, change of circumstamces (marriage, divorce etc). The DDO may not change too much, but the PPI data itself, howsoever it is sent over-the-wire over a dervice endpoint like a local hostname or IP, will be written-to and read from frequently for the N "Entity's" as network participants.

Community Question: In the What Goes on the Ledger document the following is stated

"The consent receipt contains the two DIDs that shared the information, and the attribute names and data types that were shared (rather than the actual data itself), and is signed by both parties to provide non-repudiation. The proof which is stored on Sovrin is simply a cryptographic hash of this receipt."

It there still the concept of a consent receipt (or link contract) in sovrin, and if so, is the proof stored on a ledger in the sovrin network?
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 18:22:51 GMT):<br/>
John, it's a great question. The short answer is "Yes". The longer answer is the classic "the devil is in the details". In other words, several formats for the consent receipt have been proposed, and what needs to be standardized is that format so it's clear what the hash on the ledger will prove.
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 18:56:15 GMT):<br/>
So is there code in Indy SDK that will support this function yet?
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 19:52:39 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 19:53:13 GMT):<br/>
If not, I'd be willing to suggest a plan for how to arrive at a canonical format for the consent receipts.
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 19:54:10 GMT):<br/>
it is not an immediate requirement but I can see it would be useful in regulated use cases where one would want proof that credentials were provided and verified to a site inspector for instance
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 21:55:58 GMT):<br/>
@jljordan_bcgov no, we don't have a specific consent receipt type of format (yet), the thought was to treat it like any other verifiable claim (now being called a verifiable credential by the W3C working group)
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 15 Nov 2017 21:56:18 GMT):<br/>

@theruss Fabric is a distributed ledger with the design intent of the network being a permission closed network and being able to support primarily business network (ie supply chain, etc) type problems. It has no native privacy by design identity capabilities built into it. The "identity" aspects that are there, membership services last time i looked, are about managing the permissions to the distributed ledger and not about providing identity capabilities to end users of the network. Securekey is a Canadian technology company that has added capabilities on top of Fabric to handle KYC type identity capabilities and is offering that as a service to the market. It is not generally available yet to my knowledge. 

Indy is designed to be operated as a permissioned open network with privacy by design identity primitive built into the core technology.

So I would offer that these two Hyperledger Projects have different design intents and its important to understand what your business problem is so that you select the appropriate technology. The two could work together if the business problem required it. This is how I understand the current landscape.

AFAIKT, Indy really does satisy the high level reqs of the project at this point, other than the truly "open" bit. It is highly likely we'd need to set this up as a permissioned network, even though the sensitive data would be held by the user, not on-chain, and regardless of the cryptographic security offered by Indy itself.
</p>
<p><strong>theruss</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 19:10:40 GMT):<br/>

if you run your own instance of Indy ... you decide on whether or not the ledger is public
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 19:30:02 GMT):<br/>
the nodes that write to the ledger are permissioned in both networks
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Thu, 16 Nov 2017 19:30:50 GMT):<br/>
so the choice of public vs not-public in terms of access to the ledger is a choice 
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Fri, 17 Nov 2017 01:20:00 GMT):<br/>
@theruss Yes, @jljordan_bcgov is right on that the choice of a public vs. non-public ledger is up to the implementer. At one end you have Sovrin as a public permissioned ledger for a global public utility with governance by an international non-profit foundation and a global trust framework (https://sovrin.org/trust-framework/). But at the other end you could have a specific community running an Indy ledger with minimal governance. The full range is open.

Forgive the following question; but how much of the Sovrin Trust Model (I've been going off this that you posted some time ago: http://forum.sovrin.org/t/recording-claims-on-behalf-of-another-agent/151/5) is "enshrined" within Indy at the protocol level, seeing as identity is this first-class citizen?

<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Fri, 17 Nov 2017 05:32:10 GMT):<br/>
It's a good question @theruss. The answer is "quite a bit" and "more all the time", i.e., we are developing the Sovrin protocol to enable interoperation according to the Sovrin Trust Framework, not the other way around.

On an unrelated note does Indy/Sovrin have any thoughts about password-based identity authentication. In particular I have wanted to implement password based key exchange to give long-key-like security based on a relatively shorter password: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password-authenticated_key_agreement as a way of getting around key management (would require support for ephemeral key pairs on a DLT)
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 17 Nov 2017 10:38:10 GMT):<br/>
could this fit in any way with the Indy model? I sort of assume not, and that Indy depends on you looking after your root private key matter

<p><strong>nage</strong> (Fri, 17 Nov 2017 18:23:26 GMT):<br/>
As for password-based identity authentication there is a lot of research in this area, and it would be good to reach out to @drummondreed about the distributed key management systems work that he is spearheading.  As for having a password or seed to generate a key, there are a lot of tradeoffs to consider there, including what keys are the most important and how one key can be used to generate many others.  The bitcoin and ethereum communities have pioneered a lot of interesting techniques and tried a lot of things that can now be compared.  The open source Sovrin code can use a seed to generate keys, but how this seed is generated can affect the security of your key (it shouldn't be guessable or easily determined, and our human brains are bad at randomness).

<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 07:38:06 GMT):<br/>
Hi @prmdmshra. Indy doesn't yet have any Composer-like tools for building verifiable claims or credentials like a birth certificate. You have to build the schema and claim definition manually at this point. I'm not actually a coder, so I'll leave it to the developers here to provide you more guidance.

Hi All,

I am new to Idny and just started reading. I have few basic question on Indy
1)	Is the data/transcript distributed across the Indy nodes? 
2)	Can we track the history of these data/transcript? If yes, how do we achieve this?
3)	If I have hyperledger fabric blockchain network, can I integrate Indy in the same nodes? Or should Indy be totally a different network?
4)	Do Indy support smart contract? Or it is only about the digital identity?

Can you please help me in above questions?

Thank You

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=N7Tgx5KQPq5o3esGz) @jagansundar Only the Schema (structure of data/transcript) and Claim Definition (public keys and some other cryptographic material for the issuer) is distributed across the Indy nodes, the actual user data is not. Indy runs as a separate network than fabric. Indy does not support smart contract
</p>
<p><strong>jagansundar</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 10:35:45 GMT):<br/>
@lovesh Thank you. If only the schema is distributed then, if the node which has data is out of the network, then the data would be lost. How do other nodes get the data? For example if university is issuing degree certificate and if the university node is out of the network then how do the employer or bank node get the degree information of the student
</p>
<p><strong>mountbranch</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 10:41:11 GMT):<br/>
I think that a secure channel is opened between the applicant and the employer where the data is shared. The claim is verifiable because it can be verified by the employer through the ZKP that the University has published. Or maybe the applicant just publishes a ZKP that his/her certificate is part of the list of issued certificates by the Uni. But please correct me if I'm wrong ppl with more understanding! :D

<p><strong>conroydave</strong> (Wed, 22 Nov 2017 20:42:33 GMT):<br/>
working on a project right now regarding refugees, would love to use Indy.. but i might have to use fabric/composer given the time window

@conroydave I spotted this on my travels today with regard to the use of biometrics. The particular use-case of biometric data desrcibed, seems geared towards using biometric data to unlock a wallet app, rather than as the basis for a unique identifier. But devil's advocate; what does it matter the source of entropy or randomness, that generates a user's DID and public keys? https://sovrin.discoursehosting.net/t/convenient-authentication-on-self-sovereign-identity/39/2
</p>
<p><strong>theruss</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 01:35:59 GMT):<br/>
A couple of random questions I need help answering, for a proposal myself and my team are putting together. I see that back in May, Sovrin and Engage Identity were to work together to audit Indy's trust model (and assuming the codebase also). Is this process complete? What were the conclusions?

<p><strong>conroydave</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 01:38:49 GMT):<br/>
Here I was thinkin sovrin And Indy were the same

<p><strong>theruss</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 01:39:06 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, it's hard and on a technical level "they" are.

You need to make the distinction between the "Sovrin Foundation" and the "Sovrin Project" (codebase) that has since been donated to the Hyperledger Foundation

<p><strong>theruss</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 01:40:59 GMT):<br/>
Things are compounded (and conceded by maintainers) that the distinction is in flux with regard to how the docs are written.
</p>
<p><strong>theruss</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 01:41:49 GMT):<br/>
For all intents and purposes, unless you see the word "Organisation" or "Foundation" alongside the word "Sovrin", asume that "sovrin" refers to "Indy".
</p>
<p><strong>theruss</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 01:42:13 GMT):<br/>
If I'm wrong on any point there, mods, maintainers etc, please feel free to correct me :-)

<p><strong>theruss</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 01:43:05 GMT):<br/>
I've found many anwers to my Q's on the Sovrin Forum, and I just mentally replace "sovrin" with "indy" when I need to.
</p>
<p><strong>theruss</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 01:44:50 GMT):<br/>
The other question I wanted answered was around the process for divulging customer data to the police for example. I suppose there is no PII on-ledger, so there's not much to "divulge" if asked, but I'm going to be asked this, and I should be able to give an answer, even if it's just "It's up to the implementation".

@theruss - HL Indy is an piece of Open Source Software.  Sovrin is a running a live  instance of HL Indy. 

In theory, you could run your own instance of HL Indy as a network, independent of Sovrin.  We are temporarily doing that during our development.  But when we go live, we plan to be using Sovrin.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 23 Nov 2017 03:16:01 GMT):<br/>
There is no useful data on the Ledger that the node operators could divulge.  All of the Verifiable Claim data that is exchanged may be held by the Issuers (as they see fit), and the Holder - usually the individual about which claims has been made.  So a citizen would be holding claims they have received. What the police could do about that data is presumably up to the police in the jurisdiction of the citizen.

The advantage over the current model is that the issuer (an online service, for example) need not hold onto the data that was used to identify the user.  For example, they need not hold the name and address of the person locally - if they need that data, they can request it from the user.  So their liability decreases, and there is less information that can be accessed outside of the control of the user (hacked, compelled by 3rd parties, etc.)

We are really interested in the global reach of networks like Sovrin, so if and when we go live, we definitely want to be part of those. We're experimenting now to ensure we understand the risks of using such a network vs. operating our own. In our use cases - our own network will lack the needed reach.

@swcurran I think it's also worth mentioning that the request (for name & address) could also be done "just in time" so the liability can decrease even further. There is an interesting future use case where a vendor (e.g. Amazon) doesn't really need to know my address - they just need to be able to pass something on to the delivery service (e.g. UPS) that my Agent would tell where to ship - and that may be dynamic in time (e.g. hotel next week, home the week after, office this week).

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=9qBZ6JSy9BYSinZcW) @swcurran While it's true that network participants _need not_ directly examine PII data, these data have to exist _somewhere_, and we cannot expect _every_ scrap of data from driver's licence to medical records to be stored on a customer's mobile device. There is also "current state" to be considered; which is to say the transitional period any municipality / region / country needs to go through when bringing such an SSI system online, in porting silo'd data "somewhere else".

I envisage that there will be a decidely long time (~10y+) where current data silo's containing yours and my PII data persist within organisations who are simulateneously SSI system participants. We cannot expect with all the wherewithal in the world, that _all_ data from _all_ participating agencies' silos are ported to devices or hardware wallets or other "trusted" 3rd parties. 

Taking this as predicate then; it follows that such (toxic) data is still accessible by said agencies using standard processes such as intranet applications as executables, web-based query tools or whatever. The one saving grace being that in a SSI network context, assuming such "standard" (legacy) query methods are howsoever used, the claims data and silo'd PII data cannot be correlated.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 27 Nov 2017 17:41:48 GMT):<br/>
 @theruss - I think we are agreeing.  The bulk of the data will remain with the service, but the data that can correlate it back to the users (that which makes it useful for illicit action) will NOT be stored with that bulk of data, but will remain in the control of the user.

The speed of this will depend on the ease of the transition and the motivation to change. Rules like GDPR and hacks like Equifax will drive the stick motivation, and good software will provide the carrot. Go Sovrin!!

One other factor makes the data less useful in an SSI-world. When it becomes "normal" that the only PII data accepted is that backed by a Verifiable Claim, then PII data in the wild becomes much less valuable. If you can't use a SSN as plain-text, but only as a Verifiable Claim, then having millions of SSNs will be much less valuable.  I think this will take longer than de-toxifying enterprise data, but when it arrives it will be huge help in restricting the current type of break-ins we are seeing.

@swcurran @theruss If it becomes practical and true that unverifiable PII would not be accepted then this creates a very strong economic incentive for services requiring PII (e.g. banks, insurance, utilities, govt, commerce) to adopt Verifiable Claims based technology as a strong risk mitigation measure against fraud ... quite interesting

Hi all, not sure what the best channel to ask this in:

It looks like all nodes listen for traffic on different ports starting from 9700: https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/blob/master/sovrin/pool_transactions_live_genesis

Is there a reason for this? Each IP could listen on 2 dedicated ports for client and node connections.

We have an environment where outbound ports are not open by default. Requesting an arbitrary number of outbound ports may not be feasible. Is it possible to predict which outbound ports we need to open to have an agent connect to the node pool?
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 19:53:38 GMT):<br/>
If I understand it correctly, the genesis transaction(s) specify these; e.g,
```
{
  "data": {
    "alias": "Node1",
    "blskey": "4N8aUNHSgjQVgkpm8nhNEfDf6txHznoYREg9kirmJrkivgL4oSEimFF6nsQ6M41QvhM2Z33nves5vfSn9n1UwNFJBYtWVnHYMATn76vLuL3zU88KyeAYcHfsih3He6UHcXDxcaecHVz6jhCYz1P2UZn2bDVruL5wXpehgBfBaLKm3Ba",
    "client_ip": "10.0.0.2",
    "client_port": 9702,
    "node_ip": "10.0.0.2",
    "node_port": 9701,
    "services": [
      "VALIDATOR"
    ]
  },
  "dest": "Gw6pDLhcBcoQesN72qfotTgFa7cbuqZpkX3Xo6pLhPhv",
  "identifier": "Th7MpTaRZVRYnPiabds81Y",

  "type": "0"
}```
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 19:54:24 GMT):<br/>
So if you can run a pool off multiple IP addresses, there's nothing stopping you from defining each node on its own IP address, with each node using the same two ports?

In the future, if we want to connect, we'll need to allow outbound traffic for every port that validator nodes use. Right now it seems they choose ports arbitrarily between 9700 and 9769.

<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 22:00:21 GMT):<br/>
This is because of how both RAET and CurveZMQ (based on CurveCP) handle keys on a per port basis (the ledger was never moved to pairwise CurveZMQ like we temporarily tried with agents in indy-sdk).   @lovesh or @ashcherbakov may be able to point us to more recent information or documentation
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 22:01:51 GMT):<br/>
@mgbailey is there a "best practice" on port usage or documentation on what to expect from a firewall perspective?
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 22:15:38 GMT):<br/>
@nbrempel As a "diversity" feature, stewards are allowed to select their own client and node (inter-validator) ports within the 9700-9799 range.  Stewards are instructed to either globally enable outgoing traffic from their validator to this range, or to enable outgoing to the specific ip addresses and ports that are actually in use by the validators in the pool.  The latter approach is much more administrator time-intensive, since validators are added and removed from the pool on an ongoing basis, and the required ip address/port combinations will need to be upgraded promptly.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=HXqys8ZwLDbrm9SzD) @nbrempel  There is no reason why each validator cannot use the same 2 ports for node-to-node and node-to-client traffic, the reason why it used to be an arbitrary choice was that very early pools had all machines running on the same machine, so the first node would use 9701,9702, 2nd node would use 9703,9704 and so on, but it is not relevant anymore

Hi folks, I have been reading a lot of the disparate docs around Indy, Sovrin Trust, DID Records and the rest of it, but I am yet to find a decent (actually - any) description of how "physically" a trust-anchor, or any suitable qualified role, pushes ("provisions"?) a new DID+DDO pair into the ledger. Can someone point me to a resource that will help me figure out this misisng piece? Thanks!

This issue already fixed current stable and master. 
</p>
<p><strong>alkopnin</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 08:58:55 GMT):<br/>
Okay, sounds good. Than you! 
Hence I should work with the master not with tags, is it right?
</p>
<p><strong>gudkov</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 09:03:31 GMT):<br/>
It depends on your needs. The latest stable can be build without _je_malloc_usable_size error too.
</p>
<p><strong>gudkov</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 09:04:10 GMT):<br/>
stable branch always corresponds to the latest release tag now.

To solve this you need to downgrade libsodium version. Released sodiumoxide crate isn't compatible with the latest libsodium. Mac build instruction describes how to install correct version.

We have a pool request to Indy SDK related to usage of Indy Crypto as backed for anoncreds protocol. There are no changes in API, but It will cause changing of serialization of some anoncreds entities. As result claims from previous Indy SDK version will be incompatible with the new code after this commit.

Please let me known if it is problem for someone. We will try to align this. PR https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/401

We have tried the getting started guide. Is there any other document/ tutorial available for next steps? In the getting started guide, the CLI is used for Alice and when I prompted/changed to Fabber then there I don't see the connections. Do we need to do something else to see the connection in Fabber and Banker's CLI? Where do I see the request and response of Alice's in Acme and Banker's agent/CLI?

As I understand Indy is a permission public blockchain network. In Etherium, anyone can be part of the blockchain network, by using the Etherium platform/application. In Indy how do the end user join the Indy's network? Is there any application like Etherium for Indy through which we can join to the Indy's network?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 07 Dec 2017 19:59:00 GMT):<br/>
@jagansundar - for running the demo, use this this repo. You need a bash shell, make and docker (easy on all but windows) and it starts all of the pieces you need for the full demo - nodes, command line and the agent code - Faber, Acme and Thrift.

https://github.com/brycecurtis/indy-tutorial-sandbox

Let me know if you are on windows.  I'm going to be doing a pr shortly to put a fix in for Windows.


</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 07 Dec 2017 20:04:44 GMT):<br/>
@jagansundar - HL-Indy is just the code, not a running instance.  A running instance of HL-Indy (such as Sovrin) decides who will run the nodes that operate the network. With Sovrin those are called "Stewards" and they have to sign a legal agreement to become a node operating the Ledger (blockchain). 

Read up on "Trust Anchors" in the HL-Indy. They are the entities in Indy that are permitted to write to the Ledger.  All Stewards are Trust Anchors, and they can make other entities Trust Anchors through a development of trust.  Individuals use Trust Anchors to have their decentralized IDs written to the ledger.

That's a start - gotta run.  See the documents on sovrin.org site, under "Library" - https://sovrin.org/library/
</p>
<p><strong>jagansundar</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 04:14:05 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran Thank you
</p>
<p><strong>jagansundar</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 05:45:33 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran :Thank you for the clarification.

If we have to develop an app using HL-Indy Sovrin network, do we need to be “Stewards“? or if “Stewards”, makes us a Trust Anchor, will be able to onboard individuals (Non Anchors)?

In the getting started example, “Faber college”, “Acme corp” and “Thrift bank” are the Trust Anchors. Does this mean they are Stewards?, If they are different Stewards then in this examples, how are the proofs and claims are synchronized?

My assumption of the getting started example is that an organization(XYZ) build an app which involves, college, students, hiring companies and bank. Here the organization (XYZ) is a Steward and that makes college, hiring companies and bank as “Trust Anchor” and the attributes in the claim and proof should be same

 Is HL-Indy GA available? If not any idea on tentative timeline?

Cn you please clarify all above point? 
Thank you .

<p><strong>Audrius</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 12:01:29 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran Is it any rules on how often (as per releases, etc) Indy code is updated on Sovrin network nodes?
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 14:54:21 GMT):<br/>
There are no hard and fast rules on upgrade cadence on the nodes.  The expectation is that when a release is promoted to the stable branch, after about week of testing it will be put onto the live network.  In practice, this has been every month so.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 08 Dec 2017 17:05:10 GMT):<br/>
@jagansundar - an app you would build might (not required) be an "Agency", which is an aggregation of agents that interact on behalf of end users and the Sovrin network. In that case, you would want to be a Trust Anchor, as you will be onboarding end users by writing to the network. You would not have to be a Steward - that would be a choice you would have.  You could also write software that enables an organization to be "Sovrin-Enabled" - to allow a Service (bank, college) to interact with Sovrin.  Again, the likely scenario is the operator of the Service running your app (e.g. the bank) would be Trust Anchor. We're building that type of component.

In the Alice example, none of the organizations (Faber, etc.) are Stewards, because they don't operate the nodes of the network.  The Stewards are unnamed in that example (just IP addresses), but they are the 4 (in the example) processes that are running the Ledger. The agents are writing to the Ledger (by sending messages to one or more of the nodes) and the nodes are doing the blockchain operations - distributing transactions, creating updates to the ledger, reaching consensus on the evolving state of the Ledger. Note that the claims are NOT written to the ledger - they are signed using the keys that are referenced on the ledger, but the claims and proofs are shared between the identities - e.g. Faber to Alice, Alice to Acme, etc.

On your assumption - XYZ need not be a Steward, but would be Trust Anchor.  Again - from an interacting with the Sovrin Ledger - you only need to be a Trust Anchor. You can be a Steward, but it's not necessary.

<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 15:16:04 GMT):<br/>
Hi @calvinx . In the demo code, your wallet is persisted in a hidden .indy-cli directory.  Transactions are written to the distributed ledger, and can be seen on your validator nodes (which are docker images on your system) using the "sudo read_ledger --type domain" command from the command line.

There is an libindy project that is creating a Rust CLI with wrappers for for Python, Java, and other languages. This can be used to write agents or clients.  Communications are done using this CLI.  They are via a messaging queue technology rather than Rest.
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 15:16:46 GMT):<br/>
excuse me, I meant a Rust API, not CLI
</p>
<p><strong>calvinx</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 15:16:57 GMT):<br/>
I see. I am reading through the rust cli wrapper now.

<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 15:23:59 GMT):<br/>
There are genesis files that are used to bootstrap clients and and agents with the connectivity information needed to initially contact networks.  It sounds like your setup does not have the live file genesis file.  It can be found at https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/tree/master/sovrin, named "pool_transactions_live_genesis".  This should be placed in your .indy-client directory.

However it will be of little use to you without credentials that are enabled to put transactions onto the ledger.

<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 15:25:07 GMT):<br/>

Are you with an organization that is considering becoming a Sovrin Steward?
</p>
<p><strong>calvinx</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 15:26:20 GMT):<br/>
Yes. But we are a super new and super small team of 3.

</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 15:26:43 GMT):<br/>
For the STN you will want the pool_transactions_live_genesis file instead.
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 15:27:11 GMT):<br/>
oops pool_transactions_sandbox_genesis
</p>
<p><strong>calvinx</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 15:27:33 GMT):<br/>
right. I was confused there for a second.
</p>
<p><strong>calvinx</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 15:28:24 GMT):<br/>
STN <=> `pool_transactions_sandbox_genesis`
TRUST_ANCHOR <=> `pool_transactions_live_genesis`
</p>
<p><strong>calvinx</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 15:28:54 GMT):<br/>
So what are the criteria in order to apply or qualify as a Sovrin Steward?
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 15:29:26 GMT):<br/>
Trust anchor is the name of a role on any indy ledger that has the ability to put NYMs onto the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 15:29:43 GMT):<br/>
There is info on sovrin.org.

@calvinx - it' getting easier to spin up your own network.  We did that for our testing.  You could take a look at this repo that we have used to spin up a network - https://github.com/nrempel/von-network  It's got a web server that allows you to see the nodes, the ledger, the genesis file and let's you create a DID.  We use it to connect our own agents to it.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 17:16:56 GMT):<br/>
We have an instance running on Digital Ocean - http://138.197.170.136/
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 17:20:17 GMT):<br/>
Nick has our other related repos - von-agent and von-connector. These are currently tightly coupled to our use current use case, but the von-agent code might be generally useful. Here's a background on our starting point - https://bcgov.github.io/TheOrgBook/

Hi! Does anyone have any info on scalability of Indy? I've read this: https://home.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/pdf/2016/06/appendix3-kpmg-blockchain-paper.pdf and this: https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/ID2020DesignWorkshop/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/scaling-a-bft-consensus-protocol-for-identity.md, both of which describe theoretical scalability to some degree. Does anyone know of experimental values?

Anyway, I found some details on performance of verifying ECDSA's and a quote from guys of Evernym. I was researching for a research proposal that I submitted at Lykke Streams. It's about Voting using blockchain and I wrote up my understanding ofhow it could be done using Indy.

<p><strong>calvinx</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 08:41:32 GMT):<br/>
Actually, never mind the question, Trust Anchor is just an existing Sovrin identity owner who is specifically designated so.

@WadeBarnes in the case of your bcgov/von-network example, who is the Trust Anchor?
</p>
<p><strong>calvinx</strong> (Thu, 21 Dec 2017 09:54:45 GMT):<br/>
O, you have a "Trustee1" agent which acts as the trust anchor. I see.

I suppose this is the provisioning example? https://github.com/nrempel/von-network/blob/master/server/server.py#L223

I am trying to reconcile that with what is mentioned in "First-Time Provisioning" section on page 14 of the "White Paper: The Technical Foundations of Sovirn".

Hi, since there is no indy-plenum chat, I hope this is the correct place to address this problem. I would like to get a deeper understanding of the Plenum protocol and tried to execute the `indy-plenum/tutorial/tutorial.py` script. But it seems to exit with `AttributeError: 'Node' object has no attribute 'startKeySharing'`. Is there something wrong with my virtualenv setup? Is the file deprecated? Is there a way to have an instance of Plenum with several nodes running?

</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Fri, 22 Dec 2017 12:02:35 GMT):<br/>
@wolili 
Please have a look at indy-node project and docs there (in particlar, docker images in https://github.com/evernym/sovrin-environments).
As of now, indy-node is actually Plenum with some custom txns support.
We don't have specific environment to start just Plenum (not indy-node) pool.

As of `tutorial.py` looks like it's brokem now, thanks for noticing it. Can you please log a ticket in Hyperledger INDY Jira, so we can take care and fix it?
</p>
<p><strong>wolili</strong> (Fri, 22 Dec 2017 12:16:10 GMT):<br/>

hi! I'm confused about the link (or absence thereof) between the different HL projects. For instance, is Indy based on Fabric?
</p>
<p><strong>davux</strong> (Tue, 26 Dec 2017 23:10:10 GMT):<br/>
(my understanding is that the low-level internode distributed ledger is Fabric)
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 26 Dec 2017 23:28:39 GMT):<br/>
@davux : Hyperledger Indy currently has its own distributed ledger that is not based on Fabric. You can see more about Indy here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node#indy-node-repository-structure. Currently the different HL projects are mostly standalone with only some initial interaction between projects (like SETH, the work of Sawtooth and Burrow communities coming together to bring EVM to Sawtooth). I would expect more of this sort of cross-project collaboration to happen in the 2018 timeframe. I will let the Hyperledger Indy community discuss further any plans they might have to work with some of the other HL ledgers/frameworks.

<p><strong>agawish</strong> (Tue, 26 Dec 2017 23:49:17 GMT):<br/>

Hello everyone, a quick question:
</p>
<p><strong>charyorde</strong> (Fri, 29 Dec 2017 11:51:37 GMT):<br/>
As it stands today, Can identities running on Indy be referenced in Fabric blockchain (like in a smart contract)?
</p>
<p><strong>charyorde</strong> (Fri, 29 Dec 2017 12:34:43 GMT):<br/>
Also, is it possible to use Indy as bitcoin and Ether Wallet? I want to maintain Bitcoin Wallet and Ether Wallet as Indy identities.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 29 Dec 2017 18:14:11 GMT):<br/>
If you are looking for working code of either example, I'm pretty sure the answer is no. I'm not aware of either.  

The first is presumably possible, since a reference to an Indy ID is a reference to a DID, which is an extended instance of a URN (see the DID spec - https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/). So to be used in a Fabric smart contract, there would need to be in Fabric the ability to reference a DID (easy - it's a string) and reference the related identity - trickier - must interact with an instance of HL-Indy, such as Sovrin.  It's not really an Indy thing, although presumably as this becomes real, there will be some Indy effort put forth.

The second I'd have to think about. Not sure about how an Indy key could be related to a Bitcoin wallet. It's an interesting use case.
</p>

The `CouldNotAuthenticate` error was because I hadn't sent the connection request for Faber earlier. I did that then was stuck at "sync Faber"

good afternoon, can you please explain how to use the Indy SDK? and how to implement it please, if I must first use for example this implementation of Docker https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/environment/docker/pool/README.md and then use the SDK or are they projects that work without depending on each other? since I want to implement a JAVA EE application to interact with the user.

The Indy demo will be on the 11th?
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 18:13:24 GMT):<br/>
@balmeida : The Hyperledger Indy community hosts developer calls every Thursday at 9:00 am US Mountain Time (the international time can fluctuate based on daylight savings time both in Utah and your local time).  Meetings alternate between our Agent Working Group which concerns itself with the off-ledger interactions using Sovrin Identities, and the Ledger or Indy-Node Working Group which talks about the ledger itself. You can find out more details at the community calendar : https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=linuxfoundation.org_nf9u64g9k9rvd9f8vp4vur23b0%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=UTC

Hi, I have a question about how proof responses are generated (ex. Alice responding Acme Corp's proof request).. is the proof response also a verifiable claim? and how does Alice pick and choose the claims she wants to share (or derivative of the claims ex. age above 19) with Acme corp without invalidating the signature that initially came with the verifiable claim from Faber college?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Tue, 09 Jan 2018 13:34:58 GMT):<br/>
@the_identity_guy 
The proof request response is a zero-knowledger proof. This is in fact an aggregated proof created for all claims needed to fulfill the proof request.

There is a call in indy to get all claims matching given proof request (so it can be shown on UI for example). So, Alice can select whta claims she wants to use for proof creation and what data she wants to disclose.

agree. there are already some sequence diagrams there. We're working on adding more.
BTW it could be a good excersice for anyone who wants to learn Indy to create a diagram (if there is no any) as a result of learning and send a PR.

Am new to Hyperledger Indy.. is it possible to install and develop Indy applications in windows environment?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 09:06:06 GMT):<br/>
Hi @rajivgandhi2010 
You can install and work on Windows with https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk (the API and SDK for applications dealing with Indy). So, you can developer applications based on Indy on Windows.

As for the Indy Pool and Ledger (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node), it works on Linux only as of now. So, if you want to contribute to the Indy Pool (blockchain level), you have to do it on Linux.

Hi all,

I am new to Indy and I am trying to build the indy-sdk on my MacOS using the guide (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/mac-build.md). I have followed the guide without issue up until running "cargo build". The guide (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/wrappers/java/README.md) says that I should expect to see a file "libindy.so" after "cargo build" finishes executing and move it to "./lib/", "cargo build" runs successfully yet I cannot find the file "libindy.so" anywhere in the directory. 

Have you come across this issue before? Is there a step I am missing that isn't in the guides?

Thanks,
Nij

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=d5FhDXT8Qan9WhNLH) @ashcherbakov as recommended I created a sequence diagram regarding the parties involved in the creation of a new Identity. Since I'm new, I would apprciate if someone could take a look at the diagrams and correct me if I missunderstood something. Thanks in advance!

Hi guys
</p>
<p><strong>balmeida</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:06:59 GMT):<br/>
Can you confirm that the today's meeting will have a demo session?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:27:28 GMT):<br/>
@wolili 
Thank you, it looks really good. The only thing I'm not so sure is that we should mention sending request by email (I belive we do not restrict or require only emails). @nage @Sean_Bohan ?

</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:30:21 GMT):<br/>
@wolili 
Can you please create a PR to indy-node repo and put the diagrams into docs folder (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/tree/master/docs)?
You can see instructions on how to send a PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/README.md#how-to-send-a-pr
the only thing you should prpbably tak into account is DCO signature required for Hyperledger projects.

@wolili we talk about key exchange being “out of band” rather than by email.  You could use any other means for that step of exchange.  It is usually accompanied by some type of identity validation or vetting (call center authentication steps, in person validation, notarizing-like processes, etc.  depending on what is at stake for that identity/key).
</p>
<p><strong>wolili</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 10:42:48 GMT):<br/>
I mentioned the email, because I have seen a few people in the chat asking how to access the Sovrin Network "in production" mode. And the answer given was, to contact the the Sovrin team personally via Email. But probably this not is more confusing than it helps in this context.

hey @PraveenKumar0815 

You can check out a couple of things. The Getting Started Guide is getting revised but the current version is here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/stable/getting-started.md#getting-started-with-indy

You can check out Sovrin.org, one of the first instantiations of  the Indy Code

And look at what the BC.gov crew is up to with the Org Book: https://bcgov.github.io/TheOrgBook/

I'm new to the community. I notice that in some white papers there is a mention of "issuer" but doesn't seem to exist when talking about indy in reality. Do we expect individual persons to create their identities using "personal" software and then use those in various situations or do we think there will be "issuing authorities" that will help users create sovrin identities? Is anyone working on making the project easy to use for devs/users? (mobile apps, etc)
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Tue, 23 Jan 2018 15:58:32 GMT):<br/>
Hi @tobowers 
Please have a look at this doc: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-crypto/blob/master/libindy-crypto/docs/anoncreds-design.md
and https://wiki.hyperledger.org/projects/indy/glossary to find out what we mean by the "Issuer"
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Tue, 23 Jan 2018 15:59:40 GMT):<br/>
"Issuers" issue verifiable claims using DIDs (decentralized identifiers) registered on a distributed ledger that supports DIDs (such as Sovrin). Claims can be self-issued or issued by third party issuers, the same way identity works in the real world. I recommend the new Sovrin white paper for a  full explanation of what a verifiable claims infrastructure will look like. https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-protocol-and-token-white-paper

<p><strong>tobowers</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 07:39:14 GMT):<br/>
ok thanks. I understand issuers now. So Sovrin expects users to create their own digital identities using a piece of software that is not yet defined, and use that for identity at everything that supports it. Is anyone working on the "create identity" part or a usable oauth/mobile app solution?
</p>
<p><strong>tobowers</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 07:45:25 GMT):<br/>
I'm very excited about indy. It solves an entire class of problems in my software that I solved in similar (but not as robust) ways. I'm very interested in making indy usable ASAP and contributing where I can. Is this on track? https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByaxIFopqmUVRkhyRWZ1X0RpQ1U/view I'm also wondering if I could run my own internal indy sooner than a public release... where "could" is defined as "contributors would feel fairly confident". I've joined the mailing list, here, and I'm about to go look at the jira. 

Is anyone working on indy in Berlin? I will buy you a beer/coffee/acaibowl if we can meetup and chat about this stuff :).

hmm... so if this is really decentralized, why do we need Trust Anchors? Shouldn't we allow anyone to create an ID (on the internet, no one knows your a dog)?
</p>
<p><strong>tobowers</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 10:21:13 GMT):<br/>
oh is that because only the DIDs are on ledger?

looks like trust anchors are a sovrin thing and not an indy thing in terms of joining the network

@tobowers  - couple answers (sorry I am late with these - buried today)

1. we would love your help
2. The roadmap is being revised and we are planning on sharing tomorrow as a Work IN Progress tomorrow during the WG call (will share call-in details in a moment
3 We will probably be at the Hyperledger Hackfest in Amsterdam in June and can grab a coffee then (if one of us doesn't end up in Germany before then!)
4. the contributor guidelines are being revised (into a whole section called "HOW TO INDY" which is a hub for everything contribution, but that deck is still valid
5.

<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Wed, 24 Jan 2018 21:39:20 GMT):<br/>
@the_identity_guy Trustees and Stewards are specific to Sovrin and it's governance (trust framework). If you are building your own Indy you can call the nodes whatever you want.

Hello! I need some help with the indy-crypto library:
Currently, I'm trying to call the indy-crypto library functions as a C library from Golang. I've created the header files for Golang along with importing the dylib into my project.

```
extern indy_crypto_error_t indy_crypto_bls_sign_key_new(unsigned char* seed, size_t seed_len, const void* sign_key_p);
```

Here is my Go calling code:

```
func NewSigningKey() {
	var cInstance interface{}
	ptr := unsafe.Pointer(&cInstance)
	e := C.indy_crypto_bls_sign_key_new(nil, C.size_t(0), ptr)
	fmt.Println("new sign key initialized result:", e)
	
	C.indy_crypto_bls_generator_free(ptr)
}
```

Here are the directives I'm setting at the top:

```
/*
#cgo CFLAGS: -I../dyLib
#cgo LDFLAGS: -L../dylib -lindy_crypto
#include <indy_crypto_bls.h>
*/
import "C"
```

The issue is that I'm getting a malloc error message when attempting to free that pointer that was allocated:

```
new sign key initialized result: 0

didnet(5608,0x7fffaec0d3c0) malloc: *** error for object 0xc4200104f0: pointer being freed was not allocated
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug

@Sean_Bohan thanks for the info! I noticed that Sovrin launched its "provisional" network back in August and promised more info "over the coming weeks." Did something happen to prevent that? Also, I think we're probably time-shifted so no worries about "late" replies... just happy to hear info as I can.
</p>
<p><strong>tobowers</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 09:57:49 GMT):<br/>
in the DID document on authorization ( https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/#authorization ) - it mentions that the authorizationCapability field will be removed: "The current consensus is to use object capabilities when possible to express authorization to modify a DID Document." Is ld-ocap what that means? ( https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-ocap/ ) and would the minimum signatures part of the existing authorizationCapability be handled as a caveat?
</p>
<p><strong>tobowers</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 10:30:53 GMT):<br/>
does indy/sovrin currently support the authorizationCapability for updating DID docs and is there already a plan for what it will move to?

</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 13:41:44 GMT):<br/>
@tobowers  no, we continue to make steady progress on the technical underpinnings of the network, it’s governance and the business of setting up stewards and onboarding participants.  Take a look at the Trust Framework working group over on Sovrin’s slack if you want to see more about what is going on.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 13:43:25 GMT):<br/>
As for DID spec discussions, the right way to follow along there is through the W3C Credentials Community Group.  There are active discussions there, some of which we don’t agree with, but our intent is to support the specification that comes out of that process.
</p>
<p><strong>tobowers</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 13:43:46 GMT):<br/>
ah I didn't know about sovrin's slack
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 13:45:17 GMT):<br/>
We try to keep development discussions here, where the devs hang out, and have governance and Sovrin operation discussions there, but obviously things bleed across both ways from time to time.

Folks - the BC Government has put out 2 bounty projects that should be looked at by the group here: 

Indy-SDK Corporate Scale Wallet: https://bcdevexchange.org/opportunities/opp-enhancements-to-hyperledger-indy-sdk--wallet--and-implementation-of-a-large-scale-claims-store

DID-Auth: https://bcdevexchange.org/opportunities/opp-initial-reference-implementation-of-decentralized-authentication--did-auth--and-authorization-mechanisms

Hi, can you help me, I already did the ALICE tutoring, but I want to learn more, where to start ?.

<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 20:24:03 GMT):<br/>
@tobowers @drew 41 the Identity WG is focused on decentralized identity, issues and implementations. It meets every other week (next call is 2/7). Interoperability of identity is a big topic and we spend a lot of time talking about it across hyperledger projects and non-HL DLTs (we have folks from Ethereum and Bitcoin communities join the calls sometimes as well as DIF)

You can check out the charter here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NZIOmxBSKCPkJ2OW9bPdUgH7T4JVSP4zbaumXtsyOpg/edit

cross-posting from the sovrin slack: "in the new spec in “real world examples” there is both a publicKey field and a “authentication” field. Is that just a mistake? https://pr-preview.s3.amazonaws.com/w3c-ccg/did-spec/pull/41.html#authentication"
</p>
<p><strong>tobowers</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 14:14:42 GMT):<br/>
or is that because the authentication section "links" to the public keys?

What is the consensus algorithm used by indy?
</p>
<p><strong>redpath</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 15:00:36 GMT):<br/>
So maybe I am asking for too much too early, but lets assume I am an institution with
1000 employees and I want to add them as Sovrin Entities with a claim that I know who they
are, I assume I am a Sovrin Trust Anchor who has thoroughly vetted the owners. Do I setup
four nodes (as a Alice demo) and use some API (of which I have no idea where) to programmatically
add these people to the Sovrin network? I assume I would know the DIDs afterward.
Then I can run a test program to check if they are there. Most of any code found is over a year old.
Wouldn't it be in the best interest to have such a sample?

How about this simple example Imagine lets say I am a University with a list of graduates that could be
added as Sovrin Entities. Certainly each granduate would not on their own add themselves but the University
certainly would use the public resource to provide public information about a graduate without investing in resources
out of their pocket. The University has an obligation to the graduate to assist in proving they graduated to those
that need to know. Sovrin it is a decentralized public repository for information and hence this is perfect for the
University to use without financial internal resources needed.

This scenario from the Sovrin Trusted Anchor can certainly flush out things, such as an API that works to
add Entities programmatically from a Trusted source that has done the obligation of vetting legally the owner
to be added.

Or maybe I am wrong about a Sovrin Trusted Anchor, but the reality is, there has to be an end to end
sample for an Institution which already has an obligation to vet owners legally with public information of
that owner that the institution is obligated to prove graduation (Degree) for the benefit of the owner.

@redpath welcome! we are in the middle of refactoring the Getting Started Guide for Indy to help with some of this and it should be coming out soon.

Indy is the codebase for the Sovrin DLT (Sovrin Foundation donated the code to Hyperledger to incubate the Indy project last year). Sovrin-specific questions can be asked over at Sovrin.org in the forums or the Sovrin slack. 

In your first para:
1. 1000 employees would need an edge agent on their device, and have an out of band connection request (QR Code, etc.) from the institution
2. Check out the Indy SDK - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk
3. We are working on upgrading the documentation across the board, including PUML diagrams and more code samples. More stuff to come

2nd para:
1. The university wouldn't necessarily need a blockchain for a public list of graduates - a database could do it. 
2 . A university would give a grad a verifiable claim that could include graduation date, degree, years attended, grades, etc,. That student could share the claim or a subset of the data within with anyone they wanted - another school, potential employer, etc. Verifiers of the claim wouldn't need to call the university as the Claim is signed and not revoked
3. Sovrin describes itself as a global public utility for self sovereign identity. It isn't a decentralized public repository - no personal data is actually on the ledger. 

4th para:
1. Public information is a really interesting point. Check out the awesome work the BC.gov team are doing with the org book:
https://bcgov.github.io/TheOrgBook/

Instead of private, personal data in a self-sovereign mode, they are using Indy in a B2G context

2. We want to filter up more use cases, demos and samples. I think the Getting Started Guide might cover your request for an end to end sample (Alice gets a transcript). 

3. As Indy is open source in active development, anyone can build on it and if you would want to contribute that kind of a sample as an explainer (especially if I am wrong and the GSG isn't exactly what you are looking for), it would be awesome

From the WG call today:  As of this week I have left Evernym to pursue a new opportunity as the CTO of the Sovrin Foundation.  Besides immediately improving our maintainer diversity to extend to another organization beyond Evernym, this means I will be acting as a technical voice in Indy directly in support of the Sovrin Trust Framework without any corporate conflicts of interest.  It also makes me more free to pursue additional contributors and support development efforts to grow the Sovrin network (and thus the Indy development community) without creating any conflicts with Evernym’s priorities or interests.  Thanks again to the kind words and well wishes on the call and over chat.  I look forward to all the great things we get to build with Indy!

Hi!  i took a quick look at Getting Started Guide: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/getting-started/getting-started.md 
I did not find any information regarding how the identity provided by INDY can be used in other ecosystem like fabric project.
Is this possible currently?
If yes. Any guide on this is available?

Hi Folks, just wondering if anyone has done any thinking on the concept of Guardianship in Indy/Sovrin, and how this would be implemented?  I noticed there are a few JIRA tickets (e.g. https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-624) and they have linked docs (that I don't have access to).  I'd be interested in any work/thinking that has gone into this (and especially how it affects the wallet).  Thanks in advance :-)

<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 14:53:00 GMT):<br/>
How can I verify the network is OK?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 15:37:05 GMT):<br/>
You can try running a CLI.
Also you can just make sure that tests pass (no need to run the nodes for this, as tests start a test pool (at the same process) automatically to run the test cases).

I've been doing some swatting up on identity management systems as I've only had experience as a consumer.  I was surprised to see that 'Active Directory Federated Services' and SAML seem to already provide a solution to delegated trust and Indy follows a similar design.  Forgive me if this is a naive question but is there a compelling reason why Indy would be favoured over these existing solutions?

@hawkmauk certainly patterns for delegates credentials are helpful for all types of systems, so my hope is that over time centralized systems would use these patterns more and more.  As for Indy (and the Sovrin Network), these systems enable you to interact in a peer to peer manner, without needing an identity provider to mediate the interaction.  This can radically simplify the type of integration required for interoperability and data sharing.  As for systems like active directory, I believe they could make some of the very best credential issuers—they wouldn’t have to handle online credentials verification anymore and could leverage known keys beyond their own root of trust off the public ledger (some of the stickiest integration problems in terms of delegating authority and preserving privacy).

@nage thanks for the feedback which does clarify the advantages and where Indy sits in the ecosystem.

I've been surprised at the amount of industry investment into the area of identity management with the recent blog post from Microsoft[1] and the growing memberhip of the ID2020[2] initiative so it's exciting to have the opportunity to contribute and watch as the space evolves.

There will be a steep learning curve for mass adoption so technology development will need to be matched with development of educational material.

<p><strong>Harmannz</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 19:59:16 GMT):<br/>
Hi there,

One question that I've been getting asked when explaining Self-sovereign identity is how can a verifier be confident that an issuer has performed proper checks to issue a claim for a user.

This level of assurance question is particularly important for usecases where legislation's require organisations to have a high level of confidence that the users they interact with are who they claim to be.

For example, AML (anti-money laundering) legislation in my country requires organisations to follow strict procedures (such as non-photographic identification + driver license) for onboarding and performing 'high-risk' transactions. 
If a user was to transfer large sum of money, they would have to bring their verifying documents to the bank and be verified for AML purposes.

Self-sovereign Identity can streamline a lot of these issues. For example, once a user is given a verified claim he/she can use that claim to verify the transfer of large funds from their account.
A user is no longer required to go to the bank and provide proof of their ID again and again.

The only issue is that organisations need to have a high-level of confidence that the issuer of a claim has performed the necessary checks, with respect to the current legislation, to provide the claim and that the claim is up-to-date.

Reading the newly released whitepaper, it seems that insurers could provide a solution to this problem? Is there documentation that describes how insurers work in detail?
Do you have any opinions on how to solve this problem?

</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 01:06:01 GMT):<br/>
@Harmannz it is an important and totally relevant question. The answer is not a technical one but a process one. The assurance level of a claim is related to the processes by which the claim was issued. This should generally be the domain of a trust framework. 

In Canada we are working on a Pan Canadian Trust Framework (https://diacc.ca/pan-canadian-trust-framework/) which would be an example of such a framework. The main point is to have a set of common processes and conformance criteria that issuers (in our case government identity issuers) follow and comply with such that the claims they issue can be considered trusted and used within and across jurisdictions for services that require stronger levels of assurance.

There could be other mechanisms such as insurers as well I would imagine.
</p>
<p><strong>Harmannz</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 04:10:15 GMT):<br/>
 @jljordan_bcgov  Thanks for your reply. You are right. I was trying to avoid mentioning trust framework to see if Indy authors are planning to introduce any mechanisms to make this easier.
A trust framework is something we are currently investigating, but developing it will require collaboration from multiple public and private sector organisations which may be the next step for us. 
Realistically, there isn't really a need for insurers if there is a trust framework in place and all participating parties are legally bound to it.
 
I have been following the Pan Canadian Trust Framework and I am interested to see how the final document will look like. 
I have read the Verified Person Component (https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF). 
Do you guys have a timeline on when the PCTF will be publically available?
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 14:44:59 GMT):<br/>
My understanding is the focus is on Verified Person and Verified Login right now. My main area of activity is Organizations ... we have our work in this area available at http://von.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca .. there are links there to demos, github repos and some documentation

Hi all, if my business use indy or any other hyperledger project do i need to create my own network or my business network will be shared with other in the permissioned network - because if it deploys it within my own servers it won't be transparent to users
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 20:02:14 GMT):<br/>
@mdoan - you could create your own network, but the intention of most is that the Sovrin foundation will be operating the "World Wide" instance of Indy that we will all use.  If your organization wants, it would apply to be a Sovrin Steward and operate a node. 

Most of us are running a private test instance of Indy nodes while we learn and create code, but in the big picture use, I think we all expect to be part of the Sovrin network.
</p>
<p><strong>mdoan</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 20:03:59 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran  why Sovrin Steward ? not hyperledger?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 20:07:57 GMT):<br/>
Hyperledger owns the open source indy code, but the plan is that Sovrin will operate an instance of the Indy code around the world. Hyperledger is not going to operate an instance of an HL-Indy network.

Others could operate an instance of the code as a network, but given the decentralized nature of the Sovrin Foundation and their Trust Framework, if you buy into the concepts in the Indy code, you likely buy into Sovrin as the operator of the network.

See sovrin.org for more about the network the Foundation operates.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 20:07:57 GMT):<br/>
Hyperledger owns the open source indy code, but Sovrin already operates an instance of the Indy code around the world. Hyperledger is not going to operate an instance of an HL-Indy network.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 21:45:52 GMT):<br/>
One more on this - you don't have to have a Steward on the Sovrin network to use it. Any identity can use the network.  A Steward is just if you want to operate a part of the network.

@swcurran can i define the spec of the identity data model in the network?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 01:09:47 GMT):<br/>
You mean the schema of the Verifiable Claim - what data it contains?  Yes.  That gets published by an issuer - any issuer - to the ledger and anyone can use it.

Hi everyone @here. I've felt for a long time that Indy's community should grow faster and deeper. One crucial step in community growth is to have good documentation, which helps onboarding of new users. I got fed up with Indy's documentation being scattered and outdated at times, so I decided to take example from our distributed brothers at Fabric & Corda. They have taken use of "Read the Docs" / Sphinx for documentation.

I've created a starting point for creating better Indy/Sovrin documentation. I've just created a structure for now, but the plan would be to incorporate all the documentation created thus far and curate it into the documentation structure so that it would serve new users as well as the developers working on indy/Sovrin. 

To avoid any overlapping initiatives, I'd like to get a) info if anybody else is working on similar things and b) your feedback on what would be a useful structure. 
Also, I'd be interested to know, if Hyperledger has a logical place to host this documentations, or should it rather be at sovrin.org? I've thought that having it in the indy codebase, would make it most natural. I have the docs in a forked indy-node -repo in github.

The current version of the docs can be found at http://ledger.sovrinsandbox.pub.tds.tieto.com/docs/index.html

Your thoughts?

@anttikettunen This is awesome. I was confused when I first started because I kept traversing between sovrin and indy getting started guides. 
Indy has been undergoing restructuring so things may not be so tidy right now, but there are plans to collect all indy codebase into just two repositories (indy-sdk and indy-node) so that should also ease the strain for developers to get acclimated with the library.  (My opinion)

Indy has been undergoing restructuring so things may not be so tidy right now, but there are plans to collect all indy codebase into just two repositories (indy-sdk and indy-node) so that should also ease the strain for developers to get acclimated with the library.  (My opinion)

@danielhardman @swcurran Gents just trying to catch upon the Wallet design discussions. If storage of SSI metadata and claims will be separate where will the correlation between DID and Claims (per connection) be maintained?

@anttikettunen I agree we need to do more.  I have asked the conversation from Sovrin Slack to move here, lets see if it follows us.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 15:44:42 GMT):<br/>
Basically we have three things that have been proposed:
1) docs folders in each repo for user-facing documentation (getting started guides, how to build/test/contribute, and similar user-facing docs)
2) The new indy-rfc repository for Indy Improvement Initiatives.  This is an equivalent to Rust's RFCs, Python PEPs and Bitcoin BIPs.  The idea here is for protocol issues, architecture, recommendations and modifications to the community standard to be proposed and discussed in the open, that way we are left with documentation of the architecture with version control, along with discussions and artifacts that help us point new contributors in the direction of folks that can help them get started with things that want to influence and change.
3) This new readthedocs repository that would be a compiled version, presumably of the documentation in location 1 & 2.

I have a task this week to get the initial structure of indy-rfc setup so that we can get a few process documents underway (Improvement Initiative process iii-0001, an architecture intro iii-0101, a document on basic architecture (repo and code organization) iii-0005, documentation on privacy by design architecture iii-0006, documentation of the anoncreds scheme iii-0007, documentation of the agent messaging protocol iii-0011 -- notice I'm skipping some numbers to leave room for documents that we haven't started yet).
</p>
<p><strong>anttikettunen</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 16:05:12 GMT):<br/>
@nage I had a thought that the sphinx source docs & html would replace the current docs-folder in indy-node (perhaps partially in indy-sdk as well). We could link or build the relevant iii's into the developer guides there. This would give us a single place to look for the info, instead of having it scattered around.

What's your take on where the live built sphinx site would/should/could be hosted?
</p>
<p><strong>anttikettunen</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 16:13:35 GMT):<br/>
Btw. I'm happy to do some coordination and curation work to get at least the first generation of documentation running.

<p><strong>anttikettunen</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 08:43:36 GMT):<br/>
@nage was your idea, that III's would be presented like the Rust RFC's here: http://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/ ?
Could the III process be roughly the following:
1) Create an III for an improvement at the Github issue queue.
2) The III is worked on in the issue, until it's done and marked as 'approved'
3) The approved (or also drafts?) are listed at the github.io page, similar to the Rust RFC page above.
4) Once an III is approved, it should be modified to a documentation-proper format (for example .md or .rst for Sphinx), and added to the documentation in indy repos (also referencing the original III issue).

I see the issue queue as a working area and history for the III's, but not necessarily a reference documentation, that we should use, since there will be no logical sorting of the improvements, or a larger picture at hand. The actual documentation then would be more flexible for changes and explaining related things.

Yes, though I wasn’t requiring step 4 yet, as we don’t have many contributors focusing on documentation, so I’m not sure if we can support moving them to yet another location unless it is part of the build process of the repo somehow.

I went through the documentation and the Alice/Faber demo several times now, but one thing still isn't clear to me. When is something written on the Indy blockchain and which details are exactly written on the blockchain. It's clear to be that personal details, like the SSN of Alice will never be written on the blockchain, but I also have the impression that the blockchain in Indy is more than just an index of public keys.

Hi everyone, I have a question regarding connection requests; is the DID embedded in a connection request the verinym of the trust anchor requesting the connection, or is it already a pairwise (pseudonymous) DID? In the Alice/Faber demo, when Alice downloads the connection request, she signs the nonce and returns it to Faber. Upon receiving the signed connection request, does Faber then create a pairwise DID or not?

Is Indy a proper implementation of DPKI? is there any articles about this
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 05:07:01 GMT):<br/>
mawi: in the past the getting started guide did not implement full pairwise DIDs to help simplify the tutorial, but the intent is that you would bootstrap a pairwise connection so that there was a unique id for each side.  It turns out that those DIDs do not need to be anchored to the ledger unless they are used to resolve public service endpoints or have reputations for credentials (a verinym to use the term you used from the Sovrin Trust Framework).
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 05:07:52 GMT):<br/>
the_identity_guy: we'd like to think so, but there may be differing opinions on what constitutes a "proper implementation of DPKI", so we should talk about your requirements and expectations.

A rough draft of the III process for the indy-rfc repository readme can be found here https://github.com/nage/indy-rfc/blob/master/README.md
I was hoping to get through building 0000-template.md and starting empty text/####-topic.md files for any missing or broken links but haven't been able to get around to it yet.
I'll be updating my fork of the indy-rfc repo to get to that initial pull request over the next few days.

I'm doing the Alice/Faber demo at the moment and trying to simulate the situation that Faber would have had a data breach and Alice changes the DID for that connection. Intuitively I expected the command 'change current key' to do just that, but I seem to be wrong here or doing it in the wrong what. So what would be the proper way to do this?

@arjanvaneersel 
I think you could use the following SDK calls:
- indy_replace_keys_start (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/libindy/src/api/did.rs#L89)
- send new keys (NYM) to the ledger (build_nym_request and sign_and_submit_request)
- indy_replace_keys_apply (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/libindy/src/api/did.rs#L127)
Please have a look at the test `replace_keys` (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/913a2c7702af14761f8dbea632cc17cde9003743/libindy/tests/utils/did.rs#L85)

@arjanvaneersel 
Ok, for the old CLI there is a command `change current key` as you mentioned. I believe this is what you need.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 16:24:12 GMT):<br/>
@wolili I don't think we've pursued using our BLS implementation for more generic threshold signature use case -- we use it to have validator nodes collectively sign state.  But my understanding is that it is possible if someone wanted to pursue it.  My hope is that moving it into the new shared crypto library would help attract these types of users and contributions (we'll wait until we have a reason to use a more generic threshold signature before signing off on that type of use).  @ashcherbakov might have more to say about what is in the current implementation.
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 16:34:21 GMT):<br/>
We have a quite abstarct BLS multi-signature implementation in Indy Crypto lib: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-crypto/tree/master/libindy-crypto/src/bls
Indy Plenum just uses this implementation and integrates it into RBFT consensus protocol.

1. Link to the first written tutorial, so you can see the sort of experience we have in mind: Here is the link to the first written tutorial: https://github.com/dhh1128/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/tutorials/python/send-secure-msg.md

2. Link to a PR that contains another 4 or 5 scripts around which we plan to write more tutorials: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/pull/551

3. Link to a recording of @jankokrstic playing the role of a developer and showing the results of following the first written demo: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1CmY0FbgesVZ_ZXIpYOFuG9egWgae-2FI (The sharing on this is not yet world visible, but we will fix that momentarily)

On the getting started guide, https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/getting-started.md, it says "You can install a test network in one of several ways." Which includes Docker: Start Pool and Client with Docker.

However, on the page for Docker it links to (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/environment/docker/pool/StartIndyAgents.md), it started by stating, "Once you have the Indy test nodes and client running..."

Hi there! I am a software engineer working on the Identity & Access Management workspace. I am currently working on a possible integration project with Sovrin with existing identity platforms.  My first step of business included installing a test network of Indy to better understand Sovrin and its capabilities. I soon began to use this guide to start up a test network with virtualbox (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/environment/vagrant/training/vb-multi-vm/TestIndyClusterSetup.md). However, everything went well until I got to the section about connecting indy to a sandbox. When running the command  'connect sandbox' via the indy prompt, I get back 'invalid command' or 'unknown environment'. I am not sure how to create a sandbox for this of application nor do I see any documentation of how to proceed. Would someone be willing to point me in the correct direction so that I can get the sandbox all setup and a full indy test network working properly? Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

Hi everyone, I have a question regarding Trust Anchors. The Trust Framework whitepaper states that: "A  Trust Anchor Verinym  is the DID of a Trust Anchor itself. This DID is required to have at least one Public Claim asserting the Trust Anchor’s Legal Identity". 
Is there a convention of what this public claim should look like? Maybe even a schema?

I am looking to utilize HyperLedger implementation for tractability and visibility of charity/donations.  Due to volatility of BitCoin/ Crypto, I am looking for an alternate approach where folks are able to donate directly from credit card/ bank account (payment gateway).  Would be interested to collaborate with folks who may be working on similar use cases or wanting to learn together   :-)

@mawi My apologies for the slow response—myself, @nage, and several others were at Rebooting the Web of Trust in Santa Barbara last week. On your question about Trust Anchors, two points: 1) that provision of the Sovrin Trust Framework is evolving somewhat as the public claims may be hosted directly at the Trust Anchor's public agent endpoint, and 2) in the V1 Trust Framework (called the Sovrin Provisional Trust Framework), we didn't do a technical definition of the schema, however in the V2 Trust Framework we will be doing that as part of fully defining the Sovrin Web of Trust model. If you are interested in participating in this work, see this post on the Sovrin Forum: https://sovrin.discoursehosting.net/t/joining-the-sovrin-trust-framework-working-group/502?u=drummond

@mdoan  - you can look at the info in the sovrin.org/library for details, but the main benefit is putting power behind the network.  In theory there is an added benefit of having faster access to the data on the ledger (since your server is operating the ledger), but I don't think that is going to be a strong motivator.  The main motivation is that it is in your interest to see the network grow, and being a Steward is demonstrating a commitment to that.

Hi Indyists - is there a document/example of how ZKPs are used for verifiable claims as mentioned on the bottom of page 23 of https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Sovrin-Protocol-and-Token-White-Paper.pdf ?

<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Wed, 14 Mar 2018 07:47:29 GMT):<br/>
Hi @jsmitchell 
All ZKP math is in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-crypto (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-crypto/tree/master/libindy-crypto/src/cl)
This is the main paper the verifable claims math is based on: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-crypto/blob/master/libindy-crypto/docs/AnonCred.pdf

</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 14 Mar 2018 08:22:04 GMT):<br/>
@ashcherbakov I wonder if @jsmitchell meant an API example using indy (rather than how does the math work)?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Wed, 14 Mar 2018 08:23:19 GMT):<br/>
@Dan 
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-crypto/tree/master/libindy-crypto/src/cl is exactly the API.
It' used by libindy in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/libindy/src/api/anoncreds.rs

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=hQicnmoyTcCkbvxYZ) @carter.willetts Hi @carter.willetts, I've recently gone through the vagrant setup with a network of test VMs. I maybe be able to offer some feedback based on what worked and didn't work for me.

@mboyd Hi there! Following the VM and Vagrant guide found here (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/stable/environment/vagrant/training/vb-multi-vm/TestIndyClusterSetup.md) When I get to the section called 'Setting Up a CLI Client and Configuring the Agents in the Indy Cluster' Once i attempt to connect to the sandbox, my terminal returns 'unknown environement sandbox' and 'unknown command connect sandbox'

<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 03:41:28 GMT):<br/>
@carter.willetts I also ran into this bug, and I remember that I actually switched to using a local test network on the cli01 vm instance instead of doing the entire vm test network, because I mostly wanted to get to the getting started started guide and didn't care too much about the test network's implementation.  If you want to follow this route, a guide for setting up a local test network is here: (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/stable/docs/cluster-simulation.md). If that doesn't work out, you could also try this readme: (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/stable/docs/indy-running-locally.md). 

tomorrow morning I'm going to try to get through the full vagrant test vm network walkthrough, and see if I can figure out a way to associate 'sandbox' with the virtual network that we've created. I'll let you know how it goes!

it was in one of the markdown files: i did a bunch of digging and have so many tabs open :joy: let me check
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 17:13:18 GMT):<br/>
@mboyd 1) i got the docker containers set up and all the nodes running, 2) set up the agents 3) walked through Alice's interaction w/ all the businesses

1) https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/tree/cfd1fce091991c2f2bfd667e019edc72ff8e8a72/environment/docker/pool
2) https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/environment/docker/pool/StartIndyAgents.md
3) https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/getting-started.md


</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 17:15:36 GMT):<br/>
right after that, i had a question of "how do i see the transactions that occurred on the ledger(s)?" and answered that by finding the `read_ledger` helper script. i didn't know how to use the helper scripts, but then learned to do all them via the indyclient:

```
docker exec -i -t indyclient bash
```

then

```
read_ledger --type domain
```
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 17:16:14 GMT):<br/>
i could then see the transactions being added, depending on the interaction Alice had
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 17:17:39 GMT):<br/>
i played w/ hyperledger composer and a tool like that was awesome to demo what hyperledger fabric was to my team. i am working on doing something similar for my team for hyperledger indy. currently the demo is all CLI, but over the next few weeks i'll add more on top
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 17:19:15 GMT):<br/>
my recent expertise is in web and mobile development, but i spent some time doing ruby on rails in the past. i'm just putting together the pieces to understand how everything works right now w/ indy
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 17:19:51 GMT):<br/>
i just wanted to drop in and give props to the folks involved in writing the docs and making everything relatively easy to get set up :tada:
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 17:23:03 GMT):<br/>
@burin awesome! nice work. I'll be going through the docker tutorial in a bit, looks like it went well
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 17:23:48 GMT):<br/>
yeah, it's all kinda scattered throughout, but it's there. 
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 17:24:17 GMT):<br/>
confusing at some points because there are many options (vagrant, etc)
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 17:30:33 GMT):<br/>
yeah, I've actually been asked to help make the developer onboarding experience easier for indy-node and indy-sdk. All the documentation is well done, but there are a lot of options to choose from. Does anyone have an opinion on which method to set up a test indy network is simplest for someone encountering the repository for the first time? 
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 18:22:20 GMT):<br/>
I have to say docker has worked very well for me getting into Sawtooth. Being able to spint a test network, build SDK and be able to use it right away was very smooth. I would love to be able to see the same for Indy. Run a node, build the SDK and map  a local folder for dev work
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 19:56:23 GMT):<br/>
I really like the idea of docker, it seems to be the most OS agnostic which should make for an easier time debugging when people come with issues
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 19:57:53 GMT):<br/>
@burin when you setup through docker did you have to make any changes to the docker file to get it to run? On my mac I've had quite a bit of issues getting my docker to fully get the pool running.
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 20:06:25 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog i didn't have to change any files. the only hiccup was I had to pass in a parameter for the client start script to know the IP address it should use (10.0.0.6 or something)
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 20:07:37 GMT):<br/>
i used docker for hyperledger fabric + composer too. pretty helpful for just getting things set up and poking around. i could then go in later and change stuff. but a one command setup was awesome. indy is close
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 20:16:01 GMT):<br/>
yup, I see us as being close as well which is where I want to see us going. I also realized that docker sets up quite a few docker images that aren't labeled properly so a few tweaks there would make it so I know what every image is doing.
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 22:42:16 GMT):<br/>
i've been trying to understand what gets recorded to the ledger and what doesnt, and feel like i have a pretty good grasp now (looking at sequence diagrams, getting local nodes set up and running through some sequences while spying on the ledger)

i still have some conceptual questions though:
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 22:43:15 GMT):<br/>
there's this idea that people could know when businesses use/share their information (if that's even possible). would something like that be recorded on the ledger?
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 22:44:58 GMT):<br/>
i see that a pairwise did is added to the ledger when you interact w/ a verifier/issuer. that's kinda like a chime when you walk in the door at a business. but is there a record of the "proof" happening? 
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 23:27:37 GMT):<br/>
+1 for docker and docker-compose
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 23:55:47 GMT):<br/>
@burin the majority of cases would only put a DID on the ledger and then when a claim is issued a number representing whether a claim has been revoked goes on the ledger. Then when a holder wants to prove to a verifier that they have a claim, they create a predicate zero knowledge proof indicating that they possess the claim AND that it hasn't been revoked (this is proven by verifying the number still exists within the accumulator on the ledger)
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 00:00:09 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog so in the sequence of interacting w/ "faber college", there is the initial DID put on the ledger that represents the alice + faber relationship... and is there another one once the "transcript" claim is picked up?
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 00:02:42 GMT):<br/>
ok i see those
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 00:04:11 GMT):<br/>
so when i as a holder take that claim, use it to create a proof, and send it over to the verifier, no new entry is made on the ledger. they verify it, and can also hold onto that data. and look at it later?
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 00:05:07 GMT):<br/>
i could revoke it, or faber college could revoke it. which means it's invalid, but the verifier could still hold onto the data and view/use it?
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 00:05:53 GMT):<br/>
i'm trying to understand whether there is a mechanism built in that allows me as the holder to know whether the information sent in the proof is "accessed" beyond that initial interaction
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 00:06:29 GMT):<br/>
correct, to revocation question.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 00:06:58 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure what you mean by accessed, do you mean that a relying party has viewed it?
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 00:07:07 GMT):<br/>
yes

i've heard some folks mention a benefit of "having identity on the blockchain" COULD be that "you could know who and when people are accessing your data"

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 00:10:55 GMT):<br/>
currently no this wouldn't be possible. I'm not sure how you could do what you mentioned because anyone could spin up their own node (in a permissionless system) and query their own node without writing to the ledger that they queried it.
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 00:11:30 GMT):<br/>
yeah, that's what i'm confirming
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 00:11:33 GMT):<br/>
I suppose there's ways that you could force all queries to be recorded on ledger, but it would slow down the system signaficantly I would presume.
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 00:14:36 GMT):<br/>
i'm not sure if that's even a hole or issue that needs to be addressed. in the physical world, when you give someone your ID, you get it back. and if you watch them the whole time, you can see if they make a copy of it
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 00:17:38 GMT):<br/>
for liability reasons the verifiers may not even want to hold onto that data ( i wouldn't want to hold onto it). i might just be thinking in old school ways, where you save the info so you can compare it again later. but w/ the proofs, you don't need to
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 02:09:24 GMT):<br/>
With an Anonymous credential there's ways that the holder wouldn't have to reveal the information completely, but could reveal information about it. So for example, I can generate a proof that proves I'm over 21, but don't have to reveal the exact birthday. This allows for the holder to say they don't want to reveal the information the RP is asking for, but they will provide proof of something that is more appropriate. On the other hand, a RP who gathers this data will either 1 be kicked out of the market because they are asking for too much data (ideally) or they will adapt their practices.
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 02:37:35 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog thanks for talking through this. helps to have someone to bounce ideas off of and confirm assumptions/doubts. definitely requires a change in thought!

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 02:38:08 GMT):<br/>
no problem, I'm glad I could help! feel free to ask any questions in here any time and someone will help.
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 02:39:52 GMT):<br/>
an airline for example, doesn't really need to ask for all the birthday, name, secure traveler type of info. (most just scan your boarding pass at the gate anyway). so in the future, they could sell a plane ticket with very minimal info

Hi @burin. Did you have a look at https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/libindy-anoncreds.svg? It looks quite similar to your diagrams, although this is rather abstract
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 15:05:33 GMT):<br/>
@ashcherbakov yep, i dug through a lot of the diagrams. they're at varying levels of detail and really helpful. 

i wanted to confirm that my high level understanding was mostly correct by applying it to this specific scenario. it's definitely a rabbit hole 😂
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 15:08:00 GMT):<br/>
@ashcherbakov the one you sent is good reference, because it includes the revocation stuff. which some diagrams don't have
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 15:09:27 GMT):<br/>
@burin 
1) The current workflow (in master) assumes that Issuer needs to send 'Offer Credential' before the Traveler (Prover) sends 'Request Credential'
2) Traveler (Prover) NEVER send's credentials to the Verifier (Inspector), this is very essential. The Prover sends a *proof* created from credentials on the Prover side. Credntials are private and located in the Prover's wallet only.

<p><strong>burin</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 15:11:25 GMT):<br/>
ok good clarification
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 15:11:48 GMT):<br/>
3) Step 0: Issuer needs to save Public Keys (needed to sign claims, that's issue credentials) on the Blockchain
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 15:13:00 GMT):<br/>
Please note that this is not the same key as used for pairwise relationship (ed25519 keys are used for pairwise, while CL keys (our anoncreds math) are used for credentials)
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 15:13:17 GMT):<br/>
the #1 thing: i see in the "getting started" diagram where "Offer Credential" happens before "Request Credential", but there's an implicit step where the Traveler would initiate. kinda like physically going into the office. then at the desk, the Issuer "Offers Credentials"
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 15:14:55 GMT):<br/>
or is that basically the connection that's established?
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 15:15:46 GMT):<br/>
i'm trying to relate these into concepts that are easy to understand, because i have to explain it to non-tech folks 😀
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 15:53:34 GMT):<br/>
I think it's still an open question whether Claim Offer is required or optional step.

An example of Claim Offer:
Alice graduates, and the University sends Claim Offer that her Certificate is ready to be issued. Alice replied (with a cred request) that yes, she wants to have her Certificate issued, The University issues the credential with Certificate.

So, in this example the workflow is initialized by the Issuer (Claim Offer).
If the workflow needs to be initialized by the Prover (Cred Holder), then the Prover (Alice) may send step-0 Request for Claim Offer.
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 16:05:17 GMT):<br/>
that makes sense in the Vaccination example too: like if you had a vaccine many years ago, the Health Services org could send the Claim Offer for a vaccination record, similar to a transcript 
</p>
<p><strong>burin</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 16:06:48 GMT):<br/>
if you JUST got the vaccine today, it could work the same way, just without the big gap in time before the Claim Offer is sent

Hi , we have installed Indy on Ubuntu system ,however getting below error

</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Mon, 19 Mar 2018 12:43:13 GMT):<br/>
@wangdong It looks like that the tests in acceptance folder are based on the stable version of libindy (which is quite old). These tests are not part of our CI.
The tests that are part of the CI are the *test* folders in package (for example https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/tree/master/plenum/test). These tests are based on the master libindy, and yes, master libindy has some incompatible changes with the latest stable. In particular, `signus` was renamed to `did`.
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Mon, 19 Mar 2018 12:52:32 GMT):<br/>
I cloned the indy-node from github. If it is an old version, should I clone it as well as other repo with --recursive option?
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Mon, 19 Mar 2018 12:53:30 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Mon, 19 Mar 2018 13:04:19 GMT):<br/>
CI test will include all the test cases in the independent repos(indy-node, indy
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Mon, 19 Mar 2018 13:07:47 GMT):<br/>
As I said, you can have a look at all `test` folder in all submodules (a default path for tests):
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/tree/master/plenum/test
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/tree/master/stp_zmq/test
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/tree/master/state/test
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/tree/master/ledger/test

The same for indy-node:
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/tree/master/indy_client/test
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/tree/master/indy_node/test
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/tree/master/indy_common/test
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Mon, 19 Mar 2018 13:11:54 GMT):<br/>
I think there are also https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-crypto/tree/master/wrappers/python/tests/bls   and   https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-anoncreds/tree/master/anoncreds/test
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Mon, 19 Mar 2018 13:12:06 GMT):<br/>
are also part of the CI
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Mon, 19 Mar 2018 13:22:47 GMT):<br/>
I was talking about indy-node (and plenum) parts only. There are tests in indy-sdk and indy-crupto as well.
indy-anoncreds is deprecated.

Hey everyone, since you helped me out a lot with better understanding claims I thought I might ask a question generall to permissioned chains. Does someone knows any papers on game theory analysis for permissioned chains? Sure you could say that in a blockchain its easily visible that someone is behaving faulty and in a permissioned network you can exclude that person - but if someone knows a more scientific approach to this topic that would be great!

For those in this channel who are interested in the Hyperledger Indy internship: I've gotten quite a bit of questions about what the project will look like so they can address certain aspects of the application. I apologize for addressing these questions so late (1 day before application deadline), but I wanted to provide a little clarification. First, the goal of the IPython Notebooks is to build short use cases similar to the "getting started" guide which will walk people through understand concepts in Hyperledger Indy, and show some basic use cases such as how to create, manage, and update a DID. We ideally would like to see a candidate be able to create their own use cases for this in the application and the project would involve actual implementation of this with the help of your mentors. For the DID-Auth work, we are still in discussions as to what this project will look like, but ideally this will become a replacement to traditional authentication (username/passwords) or integrate with systems that are familiar (OAuth/SSO). DID-Auth is an integral idea that is in process, so we would expect for you to be first get an understanding of the ideas, and build upon the current implementations that have been completed. Links to work related to DID Auth will be provided in the next comment.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=6iw7XReW5bk2CFF6k) @kdenhartog yes, 306 error means attempt to create already existing pool configuration. You can clean-up libindy home directory. It's folder `.indy_client` in home user directory
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 12:46:55 GMT):<br/>
Okay, I wasn't sure if the jupyter system used the local directory too, or had it's own somehow. I did try renaming just the pool and then got another error which is probably wallet already exists error. Thanks @sergey.minaev I'll give these fixes a try.

Hello Hyperledger Indy community - 

Following a "suggestion for progression" email from one of the Evernym directors, I'm bringing the following concept to the table. This concept has already been vetted by Evernym and we collectively believe that we’re looking at a game-changer in the world of data analytics. 

Creating a Sovrin-linked public permissionless ledger and accompanying cloud based data warehousing solution to store GDPR-compliant data tables aligned to Sovrin-built “ghost" schemas would enable developers to build algorithms and decentralised applications on pre-verified data without compromising self-sovereign identity. 

Imagine the benefit to a postdoctoral researcher conducting research for a groundbreaking thesis or enabling a startup company to build industry-specific algorithmic automation processes to better serve their community.

All data stored in the schema-related data tables would already be verified by trusted stewards on the Sovrin platform.

The linked ledger would aim to become the preferred DLT platform for worldwide societal analytics and applications. 

Programmers, coders and developers would be able to build open source statistics and analytics applications for societal, corporate and personal benefit. 

The concept deck has been drafted and I’m now bringing it to the Hyperledger Indy community to see what people think. 

This new proposed build would need to be built methodically and with real expert input from now until final implementation. 

From Evernym: "Hi Paul - this is starting to look good. My suggestion for progression is for you to get involved in the Sovrin community at sovrin.slack.com, or in the Hyperledger Indy rocketchat. You've got an all encompassing vision so when you introduce it to the community you might want to go back up to 50,000 feet to articulate the problem you're trying to solve, and see what people think.”

The working title of the concept deck … "Building a Linked Public Permissionless Ledger - 'the future of data analytics’ "

Please get back to me, if you're interested to hear more.

Sorry, we are in the middle of supporting rocksdb build on master. 
It was broken for a couple of days, it should be fine again today.
As a workaround, you can use stable version of Indy-node for a while.

Is there any documents on Indy Identity hubs and how they work?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Mon, 26 Mar 2018 20:42:36 GMT):<br/>
We call them Agents, and there are several presentations and docs floating around, but much of this part of the system is still being decided (most developers are building their own agent on top of the SDK—but we all agree we want an open source agent we can share).  Join the discussion in #indy-agent if you’d like to help.
</p>
<p><strong>the_identity_guy</strong> (Mon, 26 Mar 2018 23:29:17 GMT):<br/>
@nage there seems to be a distinction between agents and hubs. agents seem to represent an identity owner where as hubs store  the identity data of many identity owners... This doc for example references both separately https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-spring2018/blob/master/draft-documents/Identity%20Hub%20Attestation%20Handling.md

Thanks @ashcherbakov, In the mean while we have tried with the docker installation and we are able to create the four nodes and indyclient(node1, .. node4 and indyclient) with the given scripts. Now we are doing the indy tutorial(https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/stable/environment/docker/pool/StartIndyAgents.md), In that when we run "indy" command in indyclient it is running and taking the commands but not able to see what we are typing. Also the document suggested to connect with the test network(connect test), when we tried that we got an issue "Unknown environment test". Where actually this test network will be created? Please help with this also. Thanks in advance.

@sunilbarve 
Based on responses from members of the community, depending on your OS environment, you need to first install `libzmq` in one of the following ways:
*macOS:* `brew install zeromq`
*Ubuntu 16:* `[sudo] apt-get install libzmq3-dev`
*Windows 10:* haven't tried this yet (probably easier to just run a VM of ubuntu) but go here for installation instructions: http://zeromq.org/docs:windows-installations

@sunilbarve Timeout for `ledger_demo_works` test most probably means that libindy can't connect to test pool. Please see https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk#how-to-start-local-nodes-pool-with-docker

@the_identity_guy If you are willing to take the deep dive, the Sovrin website has some good whitepapers on how a public permissioned ledger works: https://sovrin.org/library/

<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 02:44:06 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt I think a big help for "first bugs" or "first PRs" could be centered on streamlining the onboarding process for people who encounter the Indy project for the first time. I know that for me, learning how self-sovereign identity works technically has been a challenge. The getting started guides are great, but I think there are still ways we can improve the experience. What are your thoughts?

@pwalimbe Are you still having issues, or were you able to iron them out?

Hello ..  I managed to run all the demo and everything works locally .. Now I want to run a client in a different machine than the nodes, which is more logical in real use, is it possible ? I don't know how to make my client know about the network "sandbox" (the same as the one of the nodes) and connect to it .. Can you please help me with this ?

Hi I have a general question. Hyperledger-Indy is for identity. Hyperledger-fabric has its own identity mechanism. But Can we integrate Hyperledger-indy with hyperledger fabric for identity purpose? If yes, in which case we can integrate it.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=rzDSH7956dxJGF5zw) @mboyd : This makes sense to me. Normally the fresh set of eyes is the one who can best improve documentation that we either don't look at anymore because we have advanced beyond it or we have our own version of it that we use to remind us the steps. We tend to struggle through getting started, but rarely update the material to make it better for the next person who has to use the material

@tkuhrt I'm happy to help refine the HL-Indy getting started process. Ill post a document at the beginning of next week with my process I've used and the suggestions to other people. Perhaps there are others who would also like to help with making developer onboarding a more enjoyable experience? Reach out to me if you would like to help, or have suggestions. One of my goals is to make a 15 minute interactive demo that helps people see a high level vision of Indy's potential, and another is to make a ~2 hr how-to tutorial for the indy-sdk so developers can see how this would be used in an application. I think we have the beginnings of this, but id like to refine it further.

Hello! In the tutorial on running an Indy cluster locally, we are both spawning four nodes using `start_indy_node Node1 9701 9702` etc. and `python /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/indy_client/test/agent/faber.py  --port 5555 --network <network_name>`. Are the first set of 4 nodes validator nodes and the latter 3 observer nodes (Faber, Acme, and Thrift)?
</p>
<p><strong>mawi</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 12:01:49 GMT):<br/>

Here are the developer tutorials done so far: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/doc/how-tos. Mixture of python and Java (some of each). The "prerequisites" link is currently broken but is essentially a placeholder for instructions on A) how to compile or install libindy; and B) how to start an indy validator pool in docker. Both of these are covered in the main readme 
 at https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/

Hi, I am following the dev tutorial to setup indy on my local system and was on step 2 that says this

*set Network name in config file*
the location of the config depends on how a Node was installed. It's usually inside /etc/indy for Ubuntu.
the following needs to be added: NETWORK_NAME={network_name} where {network_name} matches the one in genesis transaction files above

I am no sure how to give this network name because i cannot initialize a node without a network name. Am i missing something?

Hi, Please clarify some of my questions in Indy:```
1) Where the private key of Issuer will store?
2) Where the Wallet of each identity owner will store?
3) Pool data is stored in pool ledger which is immutable, What if a node went down or want to be removed?
4) Can we use Indy with the other frameworks like Sawtooth or Fabric?
```

The getting started tutorial at https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/getting-started/getting-started.md says ```In this tutorial we will describe the simple version of onboarding process. In our case, one party will always be the Trust Anchor. Real enterprise scenarios can use a more complex version.```Could someone describe what a real enterprise scenario would be?  I'm guessing that if neither Alice nor Bob are trust anchors but they want to establish a relationship, then they would have to send their pair-wise DIDs to a trust anchor to write to the ledger, but then that trust anchor would know about Alice and Bob's relationship.  Is this correct?  Any info on enterprise scenarios is appreciated.

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 18 Apr 2018 01:24:19 GMT):<br/>
Alice and Bob can create pairwise DID's with the issuer and send them to the ledger themselves. They will also have pairwise created with each other and send that to the ledger. Enterprise scenarios can be for example Alice and Bob having a cloud client that does the interaction with the issuer on their behalf.

Due to the importance of Schema “Overlays”, we’ve set up a new channel on Slack (sovrin.slack.com) to cover this topic: #overlays-services 

In a nutshell, “Overlays” are acetate-type layers to help define schema usage, compliance practices and services that compliment what the base schema definitions provide as a foundation.

The intro deck can be downloaded via the following link …

https://we.tl/1KZX2WlIPp

To get the ball rolling, there is a sandbox programming task defined in the deck for any keen coders out there!

If yes, any ETA?   Thanks

</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 07:53:46 GMT):<br/>
@stanleyc-trustscience @srinivasanraghavan 
The new and actual Getting Started is in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/doc/getting-started
It has documentation about how to run it (a local pool needs to be started, for example in docker, so that `connect sandbox` will work).
The old CLI (in indy-node repo) is being deprecated, because old client code and old CLI (from indy-node) is being deprecated as well.
We want to have just one official and supported client: indy-sdk.
All client, CLI and getting started code will be removed soon from indy-node.

</p>
<p><strong>eramitg</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 15:05:51 GMT):<br/>
in JIRA not sdk for indy to commit
</p>
<p><strong>eramitg</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 15:06:02 GMT):<br/>
so i have to use github 
</p>
<p><strong>eramitg</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 15:06:55 GMT):<br/>
yeah @ngeorge  @esplinr  ,please create channel as developer for indy sdk rather than using it
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 19:19:48 GMT):<br/>
@eramitg I spoke with @ngeorge (he is in our office today). He is the official maintainer of the Indy project at Hyperledger. He is also the CTO at Sovrin, which is the expected to be the first production implementation.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 19:21:00 GMT):<br/>
He thinks that most usage oriented questions should be addressed here in #indy, and that development related questions should be in the other channels based on the team: #indy-agent , #indy-node , #indy-sdk . So there is no need for a separate channel.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 19:22:53 GMT):<br/>
@eramitg I'm new here, and am still learning about how the work gets organized. But I suggest that you proposed a project that meets your requirements for your PhD. You should also join the Thursday Indy Working Group call at 4PM BST. https://zoom.us/j/232861185

Hi, can someone point me in the right direction?  How would I do the equivalent of PKI certificate chaining with indy?  More specifically, suppose A issues a cred to B, B issues a cred to C, and D wants to verify that C’s cred was issued by someone with a cred from A.  I assume B would need to generate a proof of its ownership of an A cred and include that in the cred that it issues to C.  Is there any more to it than that, or a better way?   Thanks

</p>
<p><strong>Susmit</strong> (Fri, 27 Apr 2018 09:47:02 GMT):<br/>
Hi All, pretty new to Indy, require a quick clarification or feedback on the thought while using Indy
</p>
<p><strong>Susmit</strong> (Fri, 27 Apr 2018 09:47:13 GMT):<br/>
Indy seems more a DLT rather to a blockchain to hold data and share it. Still one can store the truth (i.e. hash) in blockchain and actual data safe in Indy’s wallet for sharing.
</p>
<p><strong>Susmit</strong> (Fri, 27 Apr 2018 09:47:59 GMT):<br/>
Something like using Fabric +Indy together
</p>
<p><strong>Susmit</strong> (Fri, 27 Apr 2018 09:49:20 GMT):<br/>
any views on the thought will be great
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 00:19:26 GMT):<br/>
@Susmit Indy is indeed a DLT for decentralized identity. Note that by *by itself* is it not designed to share identity data. Rather it is designed to hold the decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and DID documents containing the public keys and agent endpoints of the parties to a digital relationship (called a connection). Those parties can then exchang verifiable credentials to establish trust.
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 00:21:19 GMT):<br/>
So as a identity utility, Indy can really be used by any other application or system that needs decentralized identity, very much like any Web application can use DNS (this is not to say that Indy serves the same purpose as DNS—it's just an analogy).
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 00:22:19 GMT):<br/>
Certainly other blockchain applications based on Fabric that need identity can use Indy, so indeed I anticipate Fabric + Indy will be a common pattern.
</p>
<p><strong>sudomann</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 04:24:18 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>sudomann</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 04:25:32 GMT):<br/>
@drummondreed So this Sovrin I've seen mention of...built on top Hyperledger Indy for sharing this identity data for validation purposes, etc?
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 04:27:33 GMT):<br/>
@sudomann Yes, the simple way to put it is that Sovrin is a global public utility for self-sovereign identity in which all the validators of the Sovrin public ledger run Indy-Node and all the hosts of private identity agents run Indy-SDK (or the equivalent). For full details on Sovrin, see the Sovrin white paper: https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-protocol-and-token-white-paper.
</p>
<p><strong>sudomann</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 04:27:57 GMT):<br/>
neat, thank you
</p>
<p><strong>Susmit</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 05:54:29 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=YMqYcbngnCifwsWHT) @drummondreed Thanks for the clarification! Believe there is no direct integration with other blockchain platform (i.e. like Fabric). But to integrate i guess one has to create identity in Indy and have a mapping against the blockchain identity by managing it via a custom application.
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 05:56:00 GMT):<br/>
@Susmit Yes, direct integration is definitely not required. But if necessary you could build it into the other blockchain, or into apps that use the other blockchain.
</p>

Out of curiosity, are there any plans to eventually rewrite plenum in Rust? Once the async/await RFC makes it into stable, it doesn't seem like all that outlandish of an idea.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 23:51:01 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm We've discussed it. It's a large project that would prevent us doing other things we want to do. We have been discussing how we can do it in pieces.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 23:51:18 GMT):<br/>
But it's not something we are considering for the short term.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 23:52:07 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm When I say "we", I'm referring to the Evernym development team that is currently the largest contributor. We aren't against someone else doing the effort.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 30 Apr 2018 23:58:57 GMT):<br/>
@sudomann The Sovrin network is likely to be the first production deployment of Hyperledger Indy code. The expectation is that there will eventually be other networks built with the Indy code in addition to Sovrin.
</p>
<p><strong>Susmit</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 08:07:59 GMT):<br/>
In context of GDPR's right to forget have a query. Once an identity data is shared by creating DIDs with any other party, is there a way that the access to that data could be revoked. 
</p>
<p><strong>nuxibyte</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 10:07:34 GMT):<br/>
Hi guys, this might be a dumb question (possibly being asked in the wrong place) but am I right in thinking that at the moment I can run up indy in docker for myself and create DIDs and interact with it like the Alice sample (which I have done and was great) - but I can't then do that with Sovrin? 
</p>
<p><strong>nuxibyte</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 11:30:01 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=ghH2pvauT2GNWJdnq) Does this mean that if were to create an indy network and make it public it would somehow connect to sovrin or would it be an individual network where users could just choose between it and sovrin? I feel like I'm missing the link between indy and sovrin and why you would want to run a separate indy node detached from sovrin.
</p>
<p><strong>nuxibyte</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 11:30:01 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:19:03 GMT):<br/>
@nuxibyte If you create an instance of an Indy network, it will run alongside the Sovrin network and be an alternative. Applications you write against that network should also be able to run on the Sovrin network.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:19:24 GMT):<br/>
@nuxibyte If you use the Indy SDK to develop an application, it should run on the Sovrin network.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:19:57 GMT):<br/>
And it isn't a dumb question, and it isn't in the wrong place. grin
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 14:21:35 GMT):<br/>
The goal of the Sovrin Foundation is to build a network that people want to use as a global public utility such that they don't want to set up alternative networks. Running your own network will continue to be useful for development. But people might find some reason to run private identity networks.
</p>
<p><strong>nuxibyte</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 16:58:04 GMT):<br/>
@esplinr thanks. 
</p>
<p><strong>nuxibyte</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 17:08:31 GMT):<br/>
@esplinr So if I want to create an iOS app that allows users to create a DID and 'connect' with other users my options are to develop it using my own dev Indy network, then release it on my production Indy network? There is no option for me to release an app that can connect to the Sovrin network at the moment. Is that right? I found some info on Trust Anchors. Is it possible to become a Trust Anchor on the Sovrin network instead of running my own network? 
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 17:09:04 GMT):<br/>
Sorry, that wasn't what I was trying to say.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 17:09:22 GMT):<br/>
The preferred approach would be to develop it against the Sovrin test network, and release it against the Sovrin production network (when it's eventually live).
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 17:09:35 GMT):<br/>
But you might consider setting up a test network for certain development tasks.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 17:10:21 GMT):<br/>
And some people think it might be useful to have their own private Indy networks for specific production use cases, but those of us at Sovrin are skeptical that would be better than just using Sovrin.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 17:11:19 GMT):<br/>
It is possible to be a Trust Anchor on the Sovrin network. The goal of the Sovrin network is that you can issue claims for others using that network to verify.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 17:11:44 GMT):<br/>
@nuxibyte 
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 17:13:11 GMT):<br/>
The summary is that most people will want to learn how to use Indy SDK against Sovrin. It's going to be a smaller community that want to learn how to run Indy directly. But we don't want to discourage that community by talking like Sovrin is the only use case.
</p>
<p><strong>nuxibyte</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 17:15:06 GMT):<br/>
that makes sense. i didn't realise there was a test network. how is that accessed? is that currently available?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 01 May 2018 17:16:12 GMT):<br/>
It's currently available, but I don't know all the policies. (I've only been on the job a couple of weeks.)

@mboyd I have a Debian Stretch (the last one). The output, when I try to install the .deb package of libindy is : "libindy depends on libssl1.0.0" and "libindy depends on libsqlite0", however these required versions are too old, which is why my system won't install them thus downgrade the currently installed versions

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=YsMwPWviHdkfEvLCk) @Susmit Sorry to be slow; was heads down last week. The short answer, using GDPR terminology, is that if a data subject shares data with a data controller using pairwise pseudonymous DIDs (which is the default in the Sovrin ecosystem), then the data subject can always: a) send a deletion request to the data controller via the private encrypted DID channel to delete any shared data, and b) revoke the pairwise pseudonymous DID assigned to the data controller. So IMHO it's a near-perfect way to implement the right to be forgotten.

Hi guys, just chatting on the #crypto-lib channel and the topic of threshold signatures came up: I understand this is a need of the Indy project.  I and my team have some experience of implementing TS and plumbing it behind standard crypto libs.
Who ( @nage ? Anyone else?) can express the requirements and wants to chat about it?  Would be good to see if we have a quick route to doing what’s needed.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 21:00:17 GMT):<br/>
@JonGeater If I understand correctly, threshold signatures would allow a definition that says that a credential is only valid if it is signed by a certain number of independent issuers?
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 21:05:16 GMT):<br/>
That rather depends on the original generation/distribution/sharing
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 21:07:46 GMT):<br/>
We use it in a scheme where the holder of the key can’t trust individual memories/processing units (because they’re really paranoid about rowhammers or spectre or something, or because they’re in cloud/leases infrastructure).  So we share the key processing around to protect the material but allow all participants to play effectively under the orders of a single issuer.
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 21:08:41 GMT):<br/>
You can add AuthZ logic to the participants of course, at which point your assertion works, subject to control of the initial m-of-n quorum 
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 21:10:05 GMT):<br/>
We (Thales, not #crypto-lib) are working in some tech to add provably secure generation/share selection, which would complete your needs I think
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 21:12:05 GMT):<br/>
What’s the concrete implementation you have in mind?  What actor would issue the request to use the private part of the credential?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 21:37:45 GMT):<br/>
I don't have a concrete implementation in mind. I'm fairly new and trying to get educated.
</p>

In addition to @ashcherbakov and @gudkov, @jlaw 1 @lovesh @danielhardman and @brentzundel all might have meaningful feedback on threshold signature schemes that would enable compatibility with anonymous credentials or broaden our support for HSMs.  We’ve been think by about how the ZKLang work we’re doing would fit into the HL shared crypto library, which has raised these same kinds of questions.

We currently use our threshold signatures to allow the validation pool to sign state proofs that allow read requests to be serviced by “observer nodes”
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 22:17:58 GMT):<br/>
In terms of a signing API, I think more of the right folks are paying attention in the #crypto-lib channel.  If we want to talk about extending indy's use of threshold signatures, lets talk here, if we are talking about a common shared API for those types of libraries, then #crypto-lib is the right home.

@JonGeater indy-crypto (used by Indy validators) does not really provide a threshold signature scheme but a signature aggregation scheme called BLS (https://www.iacr.org/archive/asiacrypt2001/22480516.pdf). Indy-node uses the aggregate signature and knowledge of participating validators to implement the threshold.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=eJwFJ3gzvEERw2i4i) @drummondreed Thanks for your reply! So even though data is shared but still it is in control of the owner. This deletion request could be specific to individual data been shared or it revokes access to all the data been shared on that channel?
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 05:23:31 GMT):<br/>
It could be either one. The best part (IMHO) is that it could be automated by the individual's Sovrin identity agent. Assuming the agent has been tracking what the individual has shared, the agent could just show the individual a menu of what the individual can choose to delete, and then send the appropriate deletion request (authenticated and encrypted) to the data controller.

The problems that I am facing is basically understanding how the system works overall especially with indy-plenum. Also, use cases are fairly complex and there is only a few of them. I already spent a couple of weeks and I still have no clear idea of how basic registration and login of a user would look like with indy. If could provide more and simpler use cases so that people could evolve that would be great.

As promised, I cleaned up the two RFC proposals for the indy-rfc repo. They are now unmerged PRs, ready for comment and github issues. You can find them here:

Credential Revocation -- https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-rfc/pull/8
SSI Notation -- https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-rfc/pull/9

I incorporated suggestions from @swcurran and @gudkov about a slight change to directory structure.

Would love feedback!
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 10 May 2018 19:52:31 GMT):<br/>
Looks good - I like the use of README.  
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 10 May 2018 19:58:36 GMT):<br/>
One other thought re: numbering.  What about making the protocol that to submit an RFC, you create an issue. That gives you the number to use for the RFC, which (a) gives a unique number, and (b) allows setting the directory name so that as @gudkov says, they are unchanged after acceptance. 

If the RFC is not accepted (PR not merged) no great harm - a number is list in the sequence numbers, but who cares as long as the numbers are unique.

It also gives a place for "pre-RFC" discussion about what the shape/scope of the RFC should be before it is formalized into a PR. That is friendlier for a newbie coming in with an idea that they aren't 100% sure about and don't want to start with an RFC PR.

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 10 May 2018 20:05:07 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran I like that idea (issue number = github number). However, it would make for sparse numbering if we used issues to track bugs or updates in RFCs, in addition to RFCs themselves...
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 10 May 2018 20:06:35 GMT):<br/>
It is a repo for RFCs, so less likely, but even so, I don't think sparse numbering matters.  People know what ERC-725 is, even if they don't know about any other RFC.
</p>
<p><strong>gudkov</strong> (Fri, 11 May 2018 11:02:37 GMT):<br/>
Why just don't use ordering starting from 1? RFCs can be incremental.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 11 May 2018 14:49:26 GMT):<br/>
@gudkov - I think the pre-RFC issue is helpful for conversation. The numbering from one is fine as long as we're good with th issue of two (or more) people creating their own PR in parallel with the same number.  Likely no big deal.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 11 May 2018 22:34:22 GMT):<br/>
Or you can have github give you a number and avoid all this :-).  Ethereum starts with issue numbers and it works.  I personally think the github issue to suggest an RFC with some discussion is a good idea - it's a more welcoming approach for a new community member.

But at the end of the day, any and all of these approaches works, so I'm good to leave it to @nage and team to decide. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 11 May 2018 22:54:45 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran agreed. I think it's either neat or a bug that GitHub PRs and issues share a namespace. Which one I think it is depends on the side of bed I get up on :)

When Acme creating a job application proof request, How it will know about `faber_transcript_cred_def_id` which is created at faber.
The example given is a single script so all variables available there so the script knows about the varialbe. What if I created a seperate scripts for each entity, How it Acme knows to get that id.

Please suggest me.

@ramanagak It would need to be communicated by Faber to the world, or to Acme. Note that this means that Acme specifically only accepts those attributes from that credential issued by Faber, so there needs to be some information exchange there

Thanks @pimotte. So Faber needs to advertise it's id whenever created to the world or Acme.

Hi :)
when the private data is stored off-ledger, how can you guarantee that it won't be deleted? As far as I understood, the ledger acts like a look-up service, and has a link to the private data which is stored somewhere else.
However, for my specific use case, I need the following:
- Private data should never get deleted or manipulated. So is it possible to store the private data encrypted on the ledger as well?
- It should be possible, that some claims (e.g. data from a sensor) can be "written" into someone's identity, without the identity holder requesting them
Would that be fine with Indy?

<p><strong>NihadOgresevic</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 19:36:29 GMT):<br/>
@daveryIBM it seems as if nodes are running because they start listening the problem happens when the nodes try to establish connection.

are you using a service called `firewalld` on your docker host?
</p>
<p><strong>daveryIBM</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 19:41:54 GMT):<br/>
that gave me a lot of problems.  It seems that `firewalld` deletes the `DOCKER` iptable and prevents docker from being able to set up networking rules that allow container networking to function properly
</p>
<p><strong>daveryIBM</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 19:42:28 GMT):<br/>
`systemctl status firewalld`.  If it's running, the best thing I know to do is `systemctl stop firewalld; systemctl restart docker`
</p>
<p><strong>daveryIBM</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 19:43:31 GMT):<br/>
that's just a guess based on the issues I've had though.  You're issue may be something different
</p>
<p><strong>daveryIBM</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 19:44:21 GMT):<br/>
you could always try `docker exec -ti <container_name> bash` to get into the container and pinging the other containers to see if you can reach them

Hello, can someone help me understand the difference in roles?
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/indy_common/roles.py
```
class Roles(Enum):
    #  These numeric constants CANNOT be changed once they have been used,
    #  because that would break backwards compatibility with the ledger
    #  Also the numeric constants CANNOT collide with the roles in plenum
    TRUSTEE = Roles.TRUSTEE.value
    STEWARD = Roles.STEWARD.value
    TGB = "100"
    TRUST_ANCHOR = "101"
```
</p>
<p><strong>stanleyc-trustscience</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 17:26:37 GMT):<br/>
eg, Trustee vs Steward vs TGB vs TrustAnchor
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 22:05:57 GMT):<br/>
Trustee is Defined in section 6.2 here https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/master/tree/doc/design/005-dkms/DKMS Design and Architecture V3.md
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 22:06:51 GMT):<br/>
Steward is defined in Step 1 here https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/getting-started/getting-started.md
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 22:06:51 GMT):<br/>

hi all. I am new to working on marketing/PR for Hyperledger. We are writing a follow up Consensus blog for the HL site that focuses on interoperability. Can someone share a few sentences, maybe 2-3, on what concrete progress we have made or are we planning to make with #indy on this front? Info. related to our own projects and other public blockchain platforms. Feel free to point me to some urls, PPTs, etc. Thanks!

@esplinr would be great to know about interoperability with other HL projects and other ecosystems. Thanks for the pointer on the #indy-outreach channel
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 21:34:43 GMT):<br/>
@Sarah.Conway The Indy crypto library is being adopted by other HL projects (at least Sawtooth). We have also been evaluating using components from other projects for our needs.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 21:35:17 GMT):<br/>
I've seen people ask about deploying Indy and Fabric together, but no one has explained to me their use case so I don't understand their goals. I'm not aware of any roadblocks.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 21:36:04 GMT):<br/>
Indy has implemented a generic payment gateway, that is expected to be used with something like bitcoin to purchase credentials. It's brand new, and so I'm not aware of anyone actually trying it yet.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 21:36:24 GMT):<br/>
If there are other technologies you are interested in, you should ask about them specifically. It's hard to know what information you would find helpful.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 21:36:56 GMT):<br/>
Indy is a  fairly new project, and so there aren't yet a lot of real world use cases showing how the different technologies come together.

Hi there. Looking at the 'Indy Contributor Guidelines' I read (slide 4, point 4): "Write good code, including unit tests (TDD!). Observe best practices and style guidelines as documented in the relevant CODING-CONVENTIONS.md file."
But I've not managed to find that md file in any repo so far... Any clue?
I'm looking for this because I wonder if you guys would accept PR containing symbolic links (that some Windows developer may have hard time with)?

A general question. How can one use DID to facilitate the user login action to a website?
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 18:41:07 GMT):<br/>
@bendon You are correct, we don't have any repository specific coding conventions readme. Generally speaking, we follow the conventions defined by the languages that we use (mostly python and rust). If you have any insight on symbolic links for win developers, we would certainly welcome a pull request! Follow the steps in our [contributor resources page](https://github.com/michaeldboyd/indy-sdk/blob/e834e86d8b43fc28c668b6396ae3af3182d68285/doc/contributor-resources.md) to get up and running quickly

Hi guys, I've been thinking about how to enable the website "sign-in" action using indy and DID
</p>
<p><strong>StanleyChen</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 17:00:51 GMT):<br/>
Here's my thought, and I hope I can get some feedback:
Essentially, there is no sign-in. The pairwise DIDs that the website and the user used to communicate with each other. THAT alone is sufficient to authenticate a user. The pairwise DIDs are stored on a blockchain, and if no expiration is set on the DIDs, then they should last forever.. In order for the user to prove who he really is within the society (if this is something to be desired in the web app), then he then required to fill out the proofRequest from the website, using the claims stored in his wallet. However, this only needs to be done once. Once the web site receives the user's credential proof and verified against the indy blockchain, there is no need to do this every single time - sort of like the identity verification in Equifax except we're replacing it with indy's verifiable claim approach. The pairwise identifiers will serve as something like certificates from CA that we currently use for mutal authentication.
</p>

<p><strong>StanleyChen</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 17:17:09 GMT):<br/>
So the user account creation flow may look something like this:
- User creates a user account within the website using his DID
- After user account is created, the account is placed in a verification stage. The website sends users a proofRequest for the credentials that it cares about (eg, ssn number credential issued by US government)
- Assuming the user has the required credentials, he/she then produce a credential proof using the claims stored in his wallet.
- The website receive the credential proof and verified it against indy's blockchain. The result is positive.
- The website then records that it has verified the user is valid by associating a "valid" status with the DID

After some time, the same user tries to log into the website again
- User makes a "sign-in" request with the pairwise DID. The request contains the user's DID and request body = "sign-in". There's really no sign-in here as there is no input of username/password. However, the website will check that the user account status by user's DID. And if the user is found and valid, then it allows user access to the web site, Seeing that the request body="sign-in", the web site directs the user to the home page or dashboard ..

<p><strong>StanleyChen</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 17:17:09 GMT):<br/>
So the user account creation flow may look something like this:
- User creates a user account within the website using his DID
- After user account is created, the account is placed in a verification stage. The website sends users a proofRequest for the credentials that it cares about (eg, ssn number credential issued by US government)
- Assuming the user has the required credentials, he/she then produce a credential proof using the claims stored in his wallet.
- The website receive the credential proof and verified it against indy's blockchain. The result is positive.
- The website then records that it has verified the user is valid by associating a "valid" status with the DID or perhaps save the credential proof along with it

After some time, the same user tries to log into the website again
- User makes a "sign-in" request with the pairwise DID. The request contains the user's DID and request body = "sign-in". There's really no sign-in here as there is no input of username/password. However, the website will check that the user account status by user's DID. And if the user is found and valid, then it allows user access to the web site, Seeing that the request body="sign-in", the web site directs the user to the home page or dashboard ..

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 19:54:08 GMT):<br/>
@StanleyChen - you pretty much have the process.  BC Gov sponsored some work that have now been moved to DIF that implement a couple of these - for example: https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-auth-extension which is the closest to the website use case you are talking about.  There was some preliminary discussion at the recent IIW conference to merge DID-Auth with FIDO2.

One thing about your use case to keep in mind.  A DID (or more specifically, a DID Doc) can be updated for key rotation (e.g. replacing a compromised keypair).  That should be a signal to the other side to recheck the verifiable credentials, as that mechanism can be used to transfer ownership of the DID to another identity (which is OK - just be aware of it).  As well, VerCreds may have a lifespan, and a service may (depending on its verification needs) want to re-verify the VerCreds from time to time.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 25 May 2018 19:55:36 GMT):<br/>
One other thing.  Much of the reason for collecting information from the user is to send notifications via email, so an email address is collected.  However, since a pairwise DID relationship enables a communication path, there is no need to collect an email address for notifications.  DIDs are fine.  Cool!!

@swcurran @StanleyChen Sorry, maybe I don't fully understand. The user wouldn't necessarily re-use a DID, they should create a new DID for this relationship with the website. More importantly, the order of the user account creation flow isn't how I would understand it

@swcurran @StanleyChen I am a little confused about how a credential proof is verified against the blockchain. The credential isn't stored on the blockchain, only the credential schema (the fields of the credential) and the credential definition (the link between the credential schema and a specific issuer) are stored on the blockchain, right? Is the credential stored by both the issuer and the holder? Or is the credential re-verified each time is included in a proof request?

The proof of a claim is not verified "against the blockchain".  The blockchain provides some of the information necessary to complete the verification process as you indicate - and there is also a Revocation Registry.

The credential itself (held by the Holder/Prover) contains sufficient information that via a Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP): that it was issued by the issuer (crypto related to the CredDef and the DID of the issuer associated with the CredDef), that it was issued to the holder (crypto related to the "link secret" held by the Holder), that it hasn't been tampered with (signature) and that it hasn't been revoked - a ZKP process executed by the Holder that the Credential has not been revoked.

Each of those mechanisms are, shall we say "tricky". I've managed to understand it enough that I believe it, without getting down into the Rust code and go line by line.  :-). Reading on the pieces and looking at the data structures passed through to the Indy-SDK is helpful, if you want to dig deeper.  Or you can trust that they have implemented those pieces.

 Hi guys, I have a question about verifiable claim.
Say, if I want to prove I have the credential `ssn: 1234-56-7890` issued by the US government. If this ssn 1234-56-7890 is stored in a claim, wouldn't be that storing personal data on the blockchain?

And I  understand that it is not recommended to store any personal info on the blockchain. But how'd be the user able to proof the ownership over the ssn, if it's not stored on the blockchain? I heard from Drummond about storing pointer, how exactly would that mechanism work?

Similar question here: If I store private data on the ledger, is that encrypted somehow, or is it readable by anyone, e.g. the stewards?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 15:44:31 GMT):<br/>
@stanleyc-trustscience - verifiable credentials are not stored on the Indy blockchain.  Some of the crypto material necessary to prove the credential is pulled from the ledger, but the actual credential is sent directly from the issuer to the holder (usually the subject of the credential).  The holder can then use the credential to prove claims to any number of verifiers, without having to contact the issuers.

@swcurran Thank you for answering all my question! ^^
You're right, I missed this part in the alice's example.
I had thought that the follow code stores verifiable claim on the blockchain. Looks like it doesn''t do that.
```   transcript_cred_json, _, _ = \
        await anoncreds.issuer_create_credential(faber_wallet, transcript_cred_offer_json,
                                                 authdecrypted_transcript_cred_request_json,
                                                 transcript_cred_values, None, None)```

The sending of credential is done with pairwise identifier and encrypted, so it's good
```    authcrypted_transcript_cred_json = await crypto.auth_crypt(faber_wallet, faber_alice_key, alice_faber_verkey,
                                                               transcript_cred_json.encode('utf-8'))```
`    logger.info("\"Faber\" -> Send authcrypted \"Transcript\" Credential to Alice")`

@swcurran Is DID's key rotation done on a periodic basis or a on-demand basis? If it happens, how'd do I figure it out on a DID document?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 16:13:18 GMT):<br/>
DID rotation is done by the DID owner on an ad hoc basis - whenever they want. Figuring out that it was done is up to the user of the DID - do they always dereference the DID (e.g. get the DID Document) before every use or perhaps only on failure to see if they have the wrong key?  Part of the Agent-to-Agent protocol (at the layer above the Indy-SDK) could be to notify the other side that a rotation has occurred.

The IBM tutorial (indy-tutorial-sandbox) also seems to be failing.  After building the docker and running 'make run-alice', all the nodes get built and the scripts run, but it never seems to fully connect to the sandbox -- it never says "Connected to sandbox."

The scripts seem to add items to the default wallet, but fail when sending NYM, ATTRIB, etc.  Instead of seeing positive results, I'm seeing things like "Request not yet verified." and "Connection not yet synchronized."

When the scripts end, it sometimes returns to the "indy@sandbox" prompt, but sometimes fails out to the docker prompt "root@67870d10e0d0:/home/indy#"

I'm using Docker v17.10.0-ce, btw.

Any ideas?

Hi everyone, I'm wrapping my head around DID Auth and Sovrin

https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-spring2018/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/DID%20Auth:%20Scope%2C%20Formats%2C%20and%20Protocols.md

```
The relying party resolves the identity owner's DID to a DID Document.
The relying party attempts to authenticate the identity owner using the authentication object(s) found in the DID Document.
The authentication object(s) may include or reference a publicKey object, in cases where the identity owner's proof is established as a cryptographic signature.
```
Looks like for Sovrin - Authentication is just using the pairwise DID established during enrollment. Well... there isn't really a need for it. Just talk over the pairwise DID directly, anytime.

@StanleyChen yeah we've considered a few ways to perform Auth. For Sovrin to Sovrin agentsw they'll run the Agent to Agent protocol which will perform authentication for each message. This paper was an outline of what is currently being done by a few projects and i need to add the Authenticated encryption setup that we use with paurwise DIDs to this doc. It will eventually lead into an interoperable DID-Auth solution where we can't assume all parties can use A2A communication, so we'll have to use other methods which are suggested in that paper.

@StanleyChen - true. However, you want other use cases supported - e.g. login to a website with a browser using did-auth, or authenticating a request to an API.  Those get more interesting - more intertwined with other technologies over which we have little to no control.

HI guys, does anyone know why,  for the Alice getting started example, government has to first publish a schema and then faber fetches the schema and publish a credential definition?
</p>
<p><strong>StanleyChen</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 16:56:50 GMT):<br/>
Or perhaps what's schema and what's credential definition
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 16:59:58 GMT):<br/>
@StanleyChen - that sequence is to get across that the schema of the credential that Faber is publishing (which is really just a list of claim/field names) is a common one that every University might use.  In theory, everyone that issues credentials can create their own schema, but that makes integration hard.  In theory, we could limit the system to only "standard" schema, but that means we have to get everyone to agree on those standards.  Indy is trying to walk the line between - allow schema to be published (put on the ledger) but encourage reuse so that defacto standards develop.

Indy is trying to walk the line between - allow schema to be published (put on the ledger) but encourage reuse so that defacto standards develop.

@swcurran So faber can add more fields to the schema published by the government?

@swcurran So faber can add more fields to the schema published by the government?  and then publish them in its cred def
</p>
<p><strong>StanleyChen</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 17:00:45 GMT):<br/>
The schema published by government is more like a "base template", 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 17:00:55 GMT):<br/>
No - if they wanted to do that, they would have to publish their own.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 17:01:26 GMT):<br/>
A Credential Definition points to a Schema.  They cannot be layered or anything like that.

<p><strong>StanleyChen</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 17:04:42 GMT):<br/>
I see, I think I get it now... this is to encourage standard schemas to be reused by different insinuation. When an insituation reused a schema, they "announce" it by publishing a credential def  on the blockchain

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 17:07:31 GMT):<br/>
That's the effect - a CredDef is used as the basis for issuing Credentials, and it contains:

* a public key for the CredDef used in issuing
* a DID for the issuer
* a link to the schema that the Creds will use
* an optional link to a Revocation Registry so that the Creds issued using this CredDef can be revoked.

Pretty sure that the Steward NYMs and a a Trust Anchor are in the genesis file.  There are likely 5 entries in the file - 4 for the Stewards/nodes and one for a Trust Anchor.

Otherwise, if you just need to have a running pool, you can use ready to use Docker: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/tree/master/environment/docker/pool

@mjmckean I did I think, I fixed it by making sure my Indy-node and Indy-SDK are same version and the genesis transactions have the correct IP addresses. In some places 127.0.0.1 is used as IP and in other places 10.20.30.201 format. To make sure you have the same version for everything, pull the Indy-SDK using the 1.4.0 Tag and for Indy-Node Vagrant (or Docker) make sure you use the 'stable' branch for add-apt-repository command anywhere, such as within agent.sh , validator.sh and lib_indy.sh files.. <- these are script files that are executed when VagrantFile is executed to create the VMs

@mjmckean @joeldudleyr3  - usiing docker and hard coding the ips to 127.0.0.1 will work on a Mac, won't on Windows. Not sure about linux.  

This command will work from a bash shell on all platforms to set DOCKERHOST so that you can use that in scripts.

export DOCKERHOST=${APPLICATION_URL-$(docker run --rm --net=host codenvy/che-ip)}

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 18:05:23 GMT):<br/>
After you do that, you can just `echo $DOCKERHOST` to see the value, and use DOCKERHOST in your scripts.  Some use that env variable already.

I'm not sure whether this is the error you are hitting, but you cannot have a network with less than 4 nodes, as it the consensus algorithm requires at least 4.

@kdenhartog  - not sure what you mean by "this" :-).  Agree on using docker for consistency - von-image (base docker images for nodes and clients) and von-network (4-node network) are good starting points.  Having a "manage" script (see von-network) with docker-compose that works across platforms is also very helpful - handling things like the DOCKERHOST problem on all platforms.  

With "git bash" and Linux Subsystem for Windows (WSL - what a name...) and a good editor - VS-Code seems to be the best right now - makes Windows development reasonable. Although - I'm not a developer, so who am I to say. :-) 
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 09 Jun 2018 19:52:48 GMT):<br/>
When I say this I mean the inconsistency of what's happening when people try to start things up. I'll definitely take a look at using a makefile as well. That's made it much easier for me to run docker.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 10 Jun 2018 00:54:36 GMT):<br/>
We are running docker. As long as we get the dockerhost right, all good on Windows, however - Mac and Linux script builders tend to use ifconfig or hardcode the docker IP address, which doesn't work on Windows. That's why we are using the codenvy docker image to get the correct IP address.

To indy experts  
Some history
The Hyperledger T & E WG approved June 4th the following: "Proposed transaction: Let us select the 15 most essential concepts (is not terms) in Fabric, Sawtooth, Burrow and Iroha, and describe clearly, using illustrating relevant examples, understandable to end users and management, how they relate, overlap and where they are different; look forward to endorsements."

On behalf of the WG I submit to you the first two concepts descriptions: A blockchain is an append-only data structure; a blockchain (instance) consists at any moment in time of a number of blocks. A block contains a number of transactions. The contents of a block is encrypted and each block contains a hash of major parts. It contains also a copy of the hash of the previous block and this is the reason for the term chain. A transaction proposal is a proposal by a client application or administrator to the blockchain network community. The network community can decide to make the transaction proposal a valid transaction, or is classified as an invalid transaction. Please let us know which improvements you want to make to these two concept definitions. Thanks
Current situation
•	SjirNijssen 19:44 
@KellyCooper @roleybrown @amundson @dan @yacovm @tkuhrt and members of the Training & Education WG, The feedback of amundson is incorporated, as well as Dan's and Tracy's. The feedback of yacov about the concept hash has hastened the introduction of concepts lists per audience; the feedback of Yacov was probably directed towards computer scientists or software engineers and I did not want to go that deep for decision makers and end users. So yacovm when we move up through the six audiances you suggestions will there get additional space. 
The response to the first two concept definitions has been encouraging. As a result there are now in the second increment 8 concept definitions. The proposal has been extended to make the concept list specific for 6 audiances, decision makers and end users, blockchain architects and blockchain consultants, admins, client application developers, smart contract developers and Hyperledger Platform developers. Everyone is invited to add his suggestions at https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/training-and-education/list-of-blockchain-core-concepts Thanks for your help. Please consider the list of 8 definitions and let us know whether we need to give additional attention to Indy concepts; your suggestions are very welcome. Thanks for your attention.

@segevm You don't have to install indy-node to get a test network going. In the Indy-sdk repo there are instructions to start a test network using docker containers. Look through the main README and you should see those instructions 🙂
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Tue, 12 Jun 2018 14:34:37 GMT):<br/>
From there, you will interact with the network through indy-sdk

First off, are you running the getting started guide from inside of a docker container or did you set it up to run natively?

@dbluhm thanks! I set it up with vagrant/virtualbox. I actually think I got that part working. I was wondering however if anyone else was having issues running pytest? I seem to run into a bunch of issues
</p>
<p><strong>mjmckean</strong> (Tue, 12 Jun 2018 20:53:04 GMT):<br/>
@slr I was able to successfully build on MacOS/Docker, but pytest also failed for me. @dbluhm didn’t you work on the python wrapper? Or was that someone else

Thanks for replying @SteveGoob. I was not very clear. There is already jenkins pipeline for indy-node. But it was not being triggered for my PR. I got @ashcherbakov to help me. So, I'm good. He also explained why it was not triggering for me and I have fixed that too. Thanks for being welling to help.

Hi guys. I am really interested in SSI, and I'd like to know if you have any relevant resources on trust in decentralized systems. I know that openbazaar has a nice concept https://www.openbazaar.org/blog/trust-is-risk-a-decentralized-trust-system/ but this would be relevant for decentralized marketplaces only.
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Thu, 14 Jun 2018 13:53:45 GMT):<br/>
Hi @LucW LucW. The Indy codebase was originally donated by the Sovrin Foundation, which has been doing a LOT of work on a Trust Framework for their network:
https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-trust-framework/

INDY does not have a trust framework (to be clear).

<p><strong>LucW</strong> (Thu, 14 Jun 2018 14:02:02 GMT):<br/>
Alright, thanks, I was indeed looking into Sovrin.

<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Fri, 15 Jun 2018 07:00:49 GMT):<br/>
As was announced, the next stable release 1.4 of Indy-Node (which will be issued in a week or so), contains some breaking changes related to transaction format. The changes are done for a better versioning support (that is to support compatibility in future) and more readable format of data (separating payload data, metadata and signature). 
There will a new stable release of LibIndy (1.5) which should be used to work with IndyNode 1.4.

*General*

    - By default LibIndy 1.5 will be compatible with IndyNode 1.3, and not 1.4
    - LibIndy 1.5 can become compatible with IndyNode 1.4 if `indy_set_protocol_version(2)` is called during app initialization.


*Guideline for applications*

   - An application can freely update to LibIndy 1.5 and still use stable Node 1.3
   - If an app wants to work with the latest master or Stable Node 1.4, then it needs to
        - support breaking changes (there are not so many, mostly a new reply for write txns as txn format is changed)
          There is a migration guide for Indy-Node 1.3 to 1.4: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/1.3_to_1.4_migration_guide.md
        - call `indy_set_protocol_version(2)` during app initialization

I seem to be having some trouble here. I'm using python, on MacOSX, and running the python file results in an error 
`ErrorCode: Pool Genesis Transactions are not compatible with Protocol version Libindy PROTOCOL_VERSION is 1 but Pool Genesis Transactions are of version 1.4`
I try the following:
`await pool.set_protocol_version(2)`
and I get another error
`AttributeError: module 'indy.pool' has no attribute 'set_protocol_version'

Hello Indy ppl, I'm planning to do a thesis work on decentralized identities and wondering if Indy is stable enough to build a full application around the ledger. Or should I go for HL Fabric and add SSI with the business model ? Can someone advice me by giving a feedback on his experience, any poc ? Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 13:40:15 GMT):<br/>
@CarlosAvim Stable channel of Indy is stable and you can build full application platform on top of it. Thesis on DIDs should use a ledger that's built for SSI. Verifiable credentials is unique feature of Indy SDK. I'm currently doing work across different application platforms and use the stable channel, things run pretty well across the board. A bit of a learning curve, but nothing too terrible.
</p>
<p><strong>CarlosAvim</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 13:50:25 GMT):<br/>
@tomislav I am not afraid of the learning curve :) Thanks for the feedback! I guess I should get started and see this by myself.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=4YMePcHLeEt2fkL6M) @tylerhester Sovrin still exists as a separate entity from both evernym and the Hyperledger Indy project. Sovrin builds on top of and contributes actively to Indy. There should be only one "indy-sdk" but evernym did recently open source a repository called "SDK" which contains an additional API on top of indy-sdk that they use to create their products. That sdk, as I understand it, will eventually be merged with indy-sdk.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Thu, 21 Jun 2018 12:32:08 GMT):<br/>
You should be using hyperledger's indy-sdk repository as evernym's repository will eventually merge with it.

Apologies as this might be naive question here. I looking into an experimentation to  integrate  a cloud hsm to indy and offload the crypto ops to hsm and let all keys stay in HSM  .  The first point I see is like implementing a custom wallet using api/wallet.rs in indy-sdk  which could talk to the cloud HSM using PKCS11 interface . Is this a good to start  and would I see the code wallet is passed as an handle to other ops .

Hi guys,when I run "start_indy_node" command with "start_indy_node Node1 0.0.0.0 9701 0.0.0.0 9702", it tell me "ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '0.0.0.0' ".
However I can run init_indy_keys successfully. I download the indy by "pip3 install indy-node" and my os is ubuntu 16.04 x86 and python version is 3.5.2
What's wrong with me?Thanks a lot

@Xzccc I think the best way to run a node for development and testing is to use docker images
</p>
<p><strong>slr</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 17:22:18 GMT):<br/>
Using indy-node, how do you actually query the ledger? any help would be appreciated 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 17:58:22 GMT):<br/>
@slr - take a look at UI for viewing the ledger here - http://159.89.115.24/. Click the "Ledger: Domain (pretty)" link to see the transactions (not blocks) on the ledger.   The repo for this code is here - https://github.com/bcgov/von-network - take a look at the server folder to see the call for displaying the data.

@tomislav Hello guy, when I use docker imagers by running ./pool_start.sh as follow the doc in github, it goes wrong .Should I use root to run this shell script? If I use root, it can run but not successfully because I cannot see the docker daemon  with "docker ps" . If i don't use sudo, it cannot run and tell me permission denied...And I wonder somewhere has the detailed guidance doc about use docker to run node?
Thank you!

So is it unheard of to run two hyperledger projects together. So if I am interested in Indy, but I want smart contract functionality, can I run them together, or at least have them coordinate in some way if they run on separate networks?
</p>
<p><strong>Sean_Bohan</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 08:34:38 GMT):<br/>
Not unheard of @ricktobacco - ChrisF from IBM mentioned at the hackfest on Weds that "membership as a plugin" (membership = identity a la Indy or others) was something they are/would be working on in Fabric and there is a lot of interest/effort in how Sawtooth and Indy can work together.  @nage - any thoughts on running Indy as the identity layer with another framework for smart contracts?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 08:38:49 GMT):<br/>
We really like the idea of using Indy as an Identity layer for other Hyperledger chains.  This isn't really possible out of the box with those platforms.  It is also possible to use Plenum's extensions to add smart contracts into Indy's chain, and no one has really tried that yet out either, so you have a lot of options.  @ricktobacco, if you are at the Hackfest going on now, find me and we can whiteboard through some ideas.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=g5ihsmien8RcHmYxx) @LuigiRiva Welcome to the Indy Community! What are your plans for using Indy? If you're going for creating applications on top of Indy, a good place to start is with the [indy-sdk README](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk) and then [running](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/getting-started/run-getting-started.md) and [reading](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/getting-started/getting-started.md) the getting started guide. The Getting Started Guide can be a little dense with information so if you have questions, feel free to ask around here or in #indy-sdk . After you work through some of that, you will probably be ready to set up a local development environment by following the steps on the Indy-SDK README. If you run into troubles there, again, please ask in #indy-sdk ! :slight_smile:

@dbluhm thanks you for welcoming me and for the information. Yes we would like to create applications on top of indy and as well we are looking to see how it can be connected or integrated with Hyperledger Fabric: we have an HF network up and running and we would like to manage authentication through Indy. Any best practice around about that?

Hi! I was going through the demo again and was wondering what exactly it means when it says "No key present in wallet for making request on Indy, so adding one". This DID for the key doesn't seem to be used anywhere else? I'm a little confused as to what it is. Any help would be appreciated!

Just joining - and we are only now considering Indy in our application - also based on fabric. Am I correct in understanding that Indy potentially helps us address gdpr compliance? - ie. no central authority or entity owns the individuals data so a user could potentially burn their own data account?

Hi! The Sovrin whitepaper speaks a lot about the incentive model of the network based on a Sovrin token. Could anyone provide me more technical information about that? Is the possibility to use a token in the Sovrin network already available?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 05 Jul 2018 14:19:30 GMT):<br/>
@LuigiRiva any Sovrin Token discussion is better suited for Sovrin slack, as that is an deployment concern for the Sovrin network specifically, not Indy in general
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 05 Jul 2018 14:20:32 GMT):<br/>
The new Indy-Node and Indy-SDK releases include some interface support for allowing payment as part of interactions with an Indy ledger, but no specific implementation.  Again networks like Sovrin are figuring out how to implement those concepts in their own plugins and configurations

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:44:20 GMT):<br/>
@MHeisoku - the term "wallet" in Indy is used for a data store of an agent. There is a defined API between the Indy-SDK and an implementation of the wallet, and there is a reference implementation in the Indy-SDK repo.  The best place to get an overview of the Indy wallet design is in an in-process HIPE ("Hyperledger Indy Improvement Enhancements") - https://github.com/dhh1128/indy-hipe/blob/616e630ee4f939d1b86abc96c2548352e80cc7e9/text/wallets/README.md

With Indy there are also Agents - implementations of the use of the Indy protocols to wrap an Wallet.  The best starting place to look at those is probably the indy-agent repo - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent.

We're just starting to play with that, but I think the process is the same as local. You need a genesis file from the network you want to talk to. For example, the Sovrin global networks - their Provisional and Test networks - there are genesis files that you can download from somewhere (I haven't looked where but I know others have found it) and use them in place of your local network genesis file. Your client spins up and uses the new genesis file to find the nodes.

Of course - the trick might be that you need to have a network connection to those nodes. In our world, we have port restrictions at the Enterrpise Firewall level that we are having to figure out.  Should be easy from home though :-)

For example - we (BC Gov) have our own test Indy network at http://159.89.115.24/, and if you go there, we have a web page that includes a link to download the genesis file.  You might want to use that to see if you can connect your client to that network.

Hi, I'm interested in using Indy to build a decentralized credit registry. Each client and institution can have a DID for that relationship, and each credit attestation can be a verifiable claim (eg took out a loan for $100 on Jan 1, paid back $5 on Feb 2, etc). What's different about credit claims vs other claims is when the client goes to show these claims to a verifier (eg a credit bureau or other bank) they can't just present their good claims and leave out the bad ones (eg defaults), the verifier needs proof that they are seeing all claims issued for that relationship. One way to solve this to calculate the merkle root of all the claims and store it on the blockchain. This merkle root will then get updated as each new claim is issued (a similar solution described by W3C https://web-payments.org/specs/source/pop2016/). The verifier can then build up a merkle tree from all the claims submitted and if the merkle root doesn't match the one on the blockchain then they will know the subject left some out. Is this a good approach to the problem? Theoretically this per-DID merkle root could be stored on any blockchain but it would be easiest if it was stored right on the Indy blockchain. Is there a way to do this now? If not what would I need to change to implement it? The ideal solution would be if this all happened automatically, ie if a client & issuer ever established DID relationship of type 'merkle-claims' (or something) then when any claim was issued it would automatically update Indy's blockchain key-value store (where the key would be the DID and the value the merkle root of all claims issued).

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=GDZ6dDbeRHj2oqutG) @jacobsaur @jacobsaur There's a few things in this that make me think it's not going to work in the way you are thinking. First, We don't have a notion of a hashed linked list that maintains a global order of all transactions like a blockchain typically would. Rather, we're more like a cryptographically verified distributed database that uses a consensus protocol to decide what is added to the db. This is a very high level view of Indy though, so I'd suggest taking a look at the documentation  to get a better understanding of how the ledger works. That can be found in the docs directory of hyperledger/indy-node and hyperledger/indy-plenum. Second, because we do not store any data on the ledger, I don't think your idea of storing a merkle roots on the ledger would work well in this case. Rather, claims would be stored in agents and if anyone wanted a record they would need to ask the payer for a copy of the claims and they could generate a proof to show that they've made the payments based upon the claims that the institution issued to them as a receipt of payment. Hopefully that helps a little in understanding better what you had in mind and feel free to ask more questions if you need. Please @ me though so I can get back to you with a response.

@kdenhartog thanks for your response! Just to check my understanding, I thought that Indy did store some things on a public ledger, such as DIDs and credential schemas. For my use case I would just need a public consensus driven key-value store which it seems like plenum supports at least under the hood (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/storage/kv_store_leveldb.py). One other thought I had was that the value for the merkle root could be stored as DID metadata (using sdk function setDidMetadata) since there should only ever be one merkle root for all claims associated with a DID. But I can't tell whether this would only update DID metadata in the users wallet or whether it would update it on the public ledger.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=ooWbeeTrzGmc5i7td) @jacobsaur That is correct, DIDs (and associated DID-Doc data stored as attribs), Schemas, Cred_defs, credential revocation registries, and I believe AuthZ device policies will all exist on ledger. One of the main reasons. Take note, no actual data that is signed in claims, or even hashes end up on the ledger. This is important to the data model because this means if an encryption scheme or a hash scheme we're ever able to be broken, all of this data could be cracked later on. So, when I read what you describe, I see it as data that shouldn't go on ledger, but rather should be maintained between the client and the institution. There's additional benefits to this as well beyond security.  In this model where data is stored off ledger and signed with keys on ledger the scalability of the system becomes much easier. The core question I ask myself when considering what should go on ledger is "Does everyone need access to this data by default, or can I get by having only the involved parties and those who they choose to share that data with storing the data?"

However, I do believe you could make a workaround to make your use case fit using Indy, but I wouldn't suggest it as you're introducing assumptions that we haven't made and I think it will become very messy quickly. If having the data exist on a ledger is absolutely necessary, I'd suggest looking at finding a way to use Indy as an identity layer with a Fabric ledger rather than trying to make Indy work in a way it wasn't intended.

I have a general question about the Alice example. Hope anyone who's interested can chime in ...

First, we have government creating the transcript schema
```
        await anoncreds.issuer_create_schema(government_did, 'Transcript', '1.2',
                                             json.dumps(['first_name', 'last_name', 'degree', 'status',
                                                         'year', 'average', 'ssn']))
        await send_schema(pool_handle, government_wallet, government_did, transcript_schema)
```
Then, we have Fabre college sending credential definition to the ledger
```
    (_, transcript_schema) = await get_schema(pool_handle, faber_did, transcript_schema_id)
 (faber_transcript_cred_def_id, faber_transcript_cred_def_json) = \
        await anoncreds.issuer_create_and_store_credential_def(faber_wallet, faber_did, transcript_schema,
                                                               'TAG1', 'CL', '{"support_revocation": false}')
    await send_cred_def(pool_handle, faber_wallet, faber_did, faber_transcript_cred_def_json)
```

Then, we have Acme requesting proof of transcript that is issued by faber
```              
job_application_proof_request_json = json.dumps({
        'nonce': '1432422343242122312411212',
        'name': 'Job-Application',
...
   'attr3_referent': {
                'name': 'degree',
                'restrictions': [{'cred_def_id': faber_transcript_cred_def_id}]
            },
....

The question here is what if Alice didn't go to faber college, but instead went to Harvard?

In the real-world UI where Alice interacts with Acme college, it seems like there would be a dropdown of supported colleges, and the credential definition id on the proof request json would set to whichever college that Alice picked

@stanleyc-trustscience - good questions and the answers will evolve.  First, Acme Corp might process any credential from a well-known schema, or set of schema, so that can reduce the variability of the data being received.  schema.org can be a source for schema, and the approach that Sovrin/Indy supports is that the market will drive the schema used for purposes.  Someone will post a good one, others will use it, it will become a defacto (or actual) standard.

On the question of many orgs - you might want to look at a paper we did about how a business might build up a set of trusted sources of data.  At worst, you'll get the concepts.  Paper is here:  Traversing the Web of Trust

@swcurran The thing is on proof_request_json, it accepts a cred_def_id, not a schema_id. And cred definition is published by individual orgs and its cred can only be issued by the org which published the cred definition.

Seems like according to your paper, the process is reversed. Instead of verifying producing the proof_request_json first, the end user would first submit proof, and the verifier then determines whether to trust the issuer of the proof.

This is currently not supported in indy?

The proof request JSON definitely supports schema_id(s) as either the ID from the ledger or the tuple {issuer, schema_name, version) - you should check that again.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 14 Jul 2018 20:51:12 GMT):<br/>
On the latter - when you receive a proof, you receive (via the CredDef) a DID for the Issuer of the credential from which the claim is from. It is "an exercise left to the user" to figure out how to chase down who that Issuer is, and whether or not you trust them.  That is really the core of Verifiable Credentials - when you get a proof, you know for each claim: who issued it, that it was issued to the Prover, that it was not tampered with, and that it was not revoked.  What you need to decide is - do I trust the issuer?  That is not so much a technical question as a social one.

When I ask a person to "proof you live at the address you say" and they give you a Hydro Bill - you have to decide - do I trust that Hydro Bill?  In the paper case, it's usually - do I trust it's not a faked bill.  With VerfCreds, you know it's not forged, but you have to be sure it's a really issued by the Hydro company.

 Looks like we can have multiple restrictions. This would work?

`'restrictions': [{'cred_def_id': faber_transcript_cred_def_id}, {'cred_def_id': harvard_transcript_cred_def_id}]

Hi all,
I was following steps from https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/mac-build.md
And got an issue with building the library: 

--- stdout
cargo:rerun-if-env-changed=SODIUM_LIB_DIR
cargo:rerun-if-env-changed=SODIUM_STATIC

--- stderr
thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: "`\"pkg-config\" \"--libs\" \"--cflags\" \"libsodium\"` did not exit successfully: signal: 6\n--- stderr\ndyld: Symbol not found: _cg_png_create_info_struct\n Referenced from: /System/Library/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/ImageIO\n Expected in: /usr/local/lib/libPng.dylib\n in /System/Library/Frameworks/ImageIO.framework/Versions/A/ImageIO\n"', libcore/result.rs:945:5

Please let me know if someone had faced and overcome that issue

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=tCRiEryfNR45jF2eL) @kdenhartog Thanks @kdenhartog . I think you're right that the best way forward might be to use Indy/Sovrin for identity, and Fabric or Sawtooth for the credit registry.

Hi guys, for the alice example, I have a few questions

When Alice present her transcript credential to Acme corp, how does Acme corp know that the claim was issued to Alice?

I notice while Alice was creating her proof request to Faber college, both `alice_faber_did` and `alice_master_secret_id` were included

```
# Alice agent
    (transcript_cred_request_json, transcript_cred_request_metadata_json) = \
        await anoncreds.prover_create_credential_req(alice_wallet, alice_faber_did, transcript_cred_offer_json,
                                                     faber_transcript_cred_def, alice_master_secret_id)
```

How were `alice_faber_did` and `alice_master_secret_id` used when Faber college creates her transcript crendential?

```
# Faber agent
  transcript_cred_json, _, _ = \
      await anoncreds.issuer_create_credential(faber_wallet, transcript_cred_offer_json, transcript_cred_request_json,
                                               transcript_cred_values, None, None)
```

How does Acme corp verify that this transcript's credential belong to Alice?
```
 # Acme Agent
 assert await anoncreds.verifier_verify_proof(job_application_proof_request_json, apply_job_proof_json,
                                              schemas_json, cred_defs_json, revoc_ref_defs_json, revoc_regs_json)
```

@stanleyc-trustscience - the Link Secret (formerly known as Master Secret) is how Alice proves she was issued the credential. Basically, before issue the credential, Alice gives Faber some credential associated with her Link Secret - some crypto. That's put in the credential and in a proof,  Alice's uses the Link Secret so to show she controls that crypto embedded in the credential. If you look up Pederson's Commitment.  Not that you really need to know that :-)

related question: looking at the examples in https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-data-model/, is it true that a claim is also tied to a DID (or any other subject identifier)? And, if one can prove the ownership to the DID, can therefore prove the ownership to the claim too?

Hi! Version 1.4 of the sdk started using something called `schemaId`, which is a structured string (see `Anoncreds.issuerCreateSchema` return value). Can you tell me how stable `schemaId` format is? Do you plan to use those ids to publicly identify schemes, or do you reserve a right to change their format in the future? What are the compatibility and migration guaranties from Indy? Can I share a `schemaId`  with a user as-is, or are those internal ids and subgect to change? Thanks!

@voddan SchemaId format doesn't change over the course of credential issuance scenario. They seem to be pretty stable now, but format _may_ change in future. If that were to happen, it would be a breaking change, so systems will need to adopt. Currently, schemaId can be shared with a user as-is, so can credential definition ids

@stanleyc-trustscience - I'm not sure. Notice I didn't answer that one :-).  It isn't used in the credential.  Others might know (@nage?) 

As I think it through, I'm betting that the cred_req that Alice is building gets signed using the DID by which Faber knows Alice.  That way, Faber can be sure that it is Alice requesting the Credential.

The high level sequence is:

* Alice <--> Faber connect - create pairwise DIDs
* Faber gets proofs/data from Alice to link Alice to backend records they have about her - e.g. her transcripts, degrees, etc.
* Faber offers Alice a Credential
* Alice sends Faber a credential request, signing it so that Faber knows it's the same person that proved who they were.
* Faber sends Alice a Credential

By signing the actual request, Faber knows it's Alice, even if the Credential Request came in some other manner than a message.

It's a theory... :-)

@swcurran I see your geneis txn file here (http://159.89.115.24/)  has different node ips. I thought you had docker running on a single node, how come they have different ips? 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 23:05:30 GMT):<br/>
That Ledger is actually at Digital Ocean on 4 nodes - 4 VMs.  In our local dev environments, we run it on one node with different ports.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 23:05:50 GMT):<br/>
As long as the genesis file reflects the config, all good.

<p><strong>Alexi</strong> (Thu, 26 Jul 2018 15:14:25 GMT):<br/>
@tomislav thanks for the suggestion! so I put it in the script and that fixed the incompatibleVersion error, however now it struggles to continue. Still in step 2 when executing  "pool_handle = await pool.open_pool_ledger(config_name=pool_name, config=None)" there is a long pause and then I get: 

_indy_loop_callback: Function returned error 307
Error occurred: ErrorCode.PoolLedgerTimeout
</p>
<p><strong>Alexi</strong> (Thu, 26 Jul 2018 15:14:34 GMT):<br/>
Any ideas on what may be causing this?

Your script can't connect to the nodes. Check your genesis file and make sure the node is accessible with those IPs.
</p>
<p><strong>Alexi</strong> (Thu, 26 Jul 2018 19:28:08 GMT):<br/>
That did it! by default the genesis file is looking for the nodes on ip 10.0.0.2, but per the first set of instructions I am running them on local 127.0.0.1. Thanks @tomislav !

hello, is there a tutorial I could use, showing all the steps from zero to hero? I'd like to get an indy setup running on ubuntu 16.04 from absolute nothing
</p>
<p><strong>Alexi</strong> (Fri, 27 Jul 2018 15:32:02 GMT):<br/>
Hey @eidand I also run ubuntu 16.04 this is what I did, follow the install part of this page https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk then follow this guid to build form source https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/ubuntu-build.md
</p>
<p><strong>Alexi</strong> (Fri, 27 Jul 2018 15:32:46 GMT):<br/>
I then did the Write a DID and Query Its Verkey tutorial to get familiar with it (I ran into a couple of problems in the tutorial, the solution of whiuch you will find just above these messages in this chat)

hello, I have a question please: in order for an issuer to create a credential ("anoncreds.issuer_create_credential"),  the Issuer needs to create an instantiated credentials json --  and within the values of the credentials json, there is a "raw" value and an "encoded" value for each attribute. May I know how is the "encoded" value calculated from the "raw" value please?   for eg: claim_json = json.dumps({
                "sex": {
                    "raw": "male", "encoded": "5944657099558967239210949258394887428692050081607692519917050011144233115103"},
                "name": {"raw": "Alex", "encoded": "1139481716457488690172217916278103335"},
                "height": {"raw": "175", "encoded": "175"},
                "age": {"raw": "28", "encoded": "28"}
            })



</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Sun, 29 Jul 2018 23:33:54 GMT):<br/>
@x1990 It's application specific, meaning up to you to encode the values as you see fit. I think the team is working on standardizing this.
</p>
<p><strong>x1990</strong> (Mon, 30 Jul 2018 10:32:21 GMT):<br/>
@tomislav Ah ok thanks very much for the clarification.
</p>
<p><strong>DuckLover</strong> (Mon, 30 Jul 2018 10:48:17 GMT):<br/>
Is there any clarification what indy-node and indy-sdk are capable to do? I followed @Alexi advice and installed indy-sdk and the ubuntu build. The indy-cli differs from the other alice tutorials so im not really sure what i need to do to be able to follow the tutorials. Do i need indy-node to use its as a pool? Or ist there any not deprecated tutorial i can follow? thanks

<p><strong>the_identity_guy</strong> (Mon, 30 Jul 2018 14:22:07 GMT):<br/>

@prmdmshra "/bin/sh: 1: /usr/libexec/s2i/assemble: Permission denied" try running the build command with --user option if not, while not best practice then try running it with prefix sudo
</p>
<p><strong>Alexi</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 12:08:43 GMT):<br/>
@geethanisp  when you did the install instrctions:

sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 68DB5E88
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://repo.sovrin.org/sdk/deb xenial {release channel}"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libindy

did you replace {release channel} with which version you wanted? (i.e stable) so:

sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://repo.sovrin.org/sdk/deb xenial stable"

@prmdmshra - I think you just have not made /usr/libexec/s2i/assemble executable. I think it is manually installed.  I think that if you do: *sudo chmod ug+x /usr/libexec/s2i/assemble*

@prmdmshra this means that '/usr/libexec/s2i/assemble' is located in the docker image not on your computer

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 01 Aug 2018 21:02:19 GMT):<br/>
@Alexi - sorry, rethinking this.  The executable should be on the system building the docker image.  So I think the at @prmdmshra needs to install the executable on his machine.

@prmdmshra - I think I might have a handle on the issue.   What platform are you running on - e.g. what is the OS into which you are typing the ./manage.sh?  Linux, perhaps?

Can you check the line-endings of the file "TheOrgBook/tob-api/openshift/python-libindy/s2i/bin/assemble"?  I suspect that they have Windows CRLF line endings vs. just LF that you need.  You can use instructions here to look at that: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3569997/how-to-find-out-line-endings-in-a-text-file.  You might want to check the other files in the same directory.  If so, I suspect the s2i is trying to run "/bin/bash<CR>" instead of "/bin/bash" - which makes sense.  Not 100% sure as the "Permission denied" thing is weird - vs. Not found.

There is a reference in TheOrgBook readme.md to an error like this being seen.

Sorry @prmdmshra - I don't have the tools to determine why your seeing the error. I have gone through the full process since we started this discussion and was able to make it work - Windows 10 machine with docker, docker-compose, git-bash and s2i.  I've googled the various reasons for such an error and can't see what's happening. 

What machine are you running on?

Hello, I have a question regarding the Onboarding process described in the example case study  "https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/getting-started/getting-started.md", under point number 11 please.  

For convenience, the relevant excerpt is: "Faber anonymously encrypts the connection response by calling crypto.anon_crypt with the Steward verkey. The Anonymous-encryption schema is designed for the sending of messages to a Recipient which has been given its public key. Only the Recipient can decrypt these messages, using its private key. While the Recipient can verify the integrity of the message, it cannot verify the identity of the Sender." 

My question is: what is the protection against someone (for eg, a MITM) who pretends to be Faber and submits its own DID,VerKey pair (instead of Faber's) as connection response to Steward?

With the new indy-sdk, how do we not encrypt the wallet?
What value should I set `credentials` to?
`wallet.create_wallet(pool_name, wallet_name, None, "{}", credentials)

I tried None (or null) and empty string, `{"key":""}` and `{}`. And none of them worked

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=56AXvDLb5AovFK939) @x1990 I am also wondering this, is it assumed that the connection request is sent via some other secure means?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=56AXvDLb5AovFK939) @x1990 Quoting a response I got from #indy-sdk channel
"@marrowdev The connection establishment process encrypts all messages agent-to-agent, intercepting wouldn't compromise it. The initial invitiation/offer should be delivered via secure way in already established trusted environment. These protocols and concepts are discussed in great detail in #indy-agent channel."
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 16:43:45 GMT):<br/>
@marrowdev @x1990 - I agree with what was said above about agent communications and the methods to prevent compromise. However, there is another key thing to keep in mind in this ecosystem.  A connection alone should not be trusted - it merely establishing a communication channel between two identities. The use of Verifiable Credentials should be used after the connection is established to determine if you should trust the Identity for the purposes of the connection. Thus, if a MITM attack could occur, the connection might be established, but the attacker could not prove, for example, that the Identity is John Smith as issued by the DMV (e.g. on their Driver's Licence) to them and that their TaxID is XXXXXX as issued by the Federal Government to them (if that information is needed). Just knowing that data is no longer enough - you have to be able to prove who issued it to you.

VCs are the key for establishing the necessary level of trust for continuing with the relationship.  Note as well that the verification can (and should) be both ways - Alice must prove with VCs who she is to Faber, and Faber must prove with VCs to Alice who it is. It is a peer-to-peer relationship.
</p>
<p><strong>stanleyc-trustscience</strong> (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 17:11:31 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran Very good post. I'd like brainstorm a bit about the process:

Establishing a secure connection with pairwise DID:
1) Alice send Faber a connection request
2) Faber responds with a faber_alice_did and nonce
3) Alice sends Faber a connection response (alice_faber_did, alice_faber_verkey, nonce) encrypted with faber_alice_verkey
4) Faber decrypts the connection response with faber_alice_verkey and make sure nonce match
5) Connection is now established

Note at this point, they don't know each other's identity within the society, or haven't prove their identity to each other yet

Vetting each other's Identity
6) Alice gets a Social Security Number proof request from Faber
7) Alice searches within her wallet for the  credential issued by the government, and sends the credentials to Faber
8) Fabers confirms the proof by verifying it against indy ledger
9) Faber gets a Education Instituion proof request from Alice
10) Faber searches within its wallet for the credential issued by the government, and send the credentials to Alice
11) Alice confirms the proof by verifying it against indy ledger
12) Both Alice and Faber now confirm each other's identity within the society 

The process of vetting identity doesn't necessary need to be performed using the steps above. It could be real life interaction, or phone , email, etc. But if we were to do it in the VC way, this is what it'd look like, I'd imagine

Also the protocol of vetting identity using the VC way, doesn't seem to have a standard yet?  So perhaps a standard will emerge for exchanging VC for the purpose of vetting social identity

@swcurran Very good post. I'd like brainstorm a bit about the process:

Establishing a secure connection with pairwise DID:
1) Alice send Faber a connection request
2) Faber responds with a faber_alice_did and nonce
3) Alice sends Faber a connection response (alice_faber_did, alice_faber_verkey, nonce) encrypted with faber_alice_verkey
4) Faber decrypts the connection response with faber_alice_verkey and make sure nonce match
5) Connection is now established

Note at this point, they don't know each other's identity within the society, or haven't prove their identity to each other yet

@stanleyc-trustscience - That's about how I envision it happening at a high level.  And absolutely, the details are to be worked out and an issuer ecosystem created. Our project (Verifiable Organizations Network) might be the path to Faber (or some other organization) proving who they are, as we are working with Registries - the gov't entities that track organizations - corps, professional organizations, societies, etc.  A comparable, standardized credential issuance for a Driver's Licence organization should be relatively fast to happen - such organizations are in close communication and they face a pretty significant problem with forgeries. They are motivated to correct the problem.

Hey all, for some reason when creating wallets on the indy pool I am getting the following error:

`_do_call: Function indy_create_wallet returned error 103
Error occurred: ErrorCode.CommonInvalidParam4
`
</p>
<p><strong>Alexi</strong> (Mon, 13 Aug 2018 17:27:34 GMT):<br/>
this came out of no where, where it was not happening before. it even happens when I run the write_did script from the documentation. which I could run perfectly fine before. SO I do not know what is causing this to happen all of a sudden.
</p>
<p><strong>Alexi</strong> (Mon, 13 Aug 2018 17:28:58 GMT):<br/>
This call will cuase the error in the write_did script:

print_log('\n3. Create new identity wallet\n')
        await wallet.create_wallet(pool_name, wallet_name, None, None, wallet_credentials)

so it says the 4th parameter in this case 'None' is invalid. But why is this is the case when its the boilerplate given by the github documentation 
</p>
<p><strong>Alexi</strong> (Mon, 13 Aug 2018 18:09:37 GMT):<br/>
ive been trying to figure this out but looking into it makes it somewhat more confusing to why this is happening:

trying to remove the fourth parameter 'None' results in a missing parameter error meaning we need all five parameters to create the wallet. So I tried looking into what the fourth parameter requires, I went to the indy-sdk python library at wallet https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/wrappers/python/indy/wallet.py but found that the create_wallet command in the library is actually only calling for two parameters:

async def create_wallet(config: str,
                        credentials: str) -> None:

so I am somewhat more lost than before, any ideas?

@Alexi same problem here
</p>
<p><strong>microinclude</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 01:59:34 GMT):<br/>
The problem is on this code:

```res = await do_call('indy_open_wallet',
                        c_config,
                        c_credentials,
                        open_wallet.cb)```
</p>
<p><strong>microinclude</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 02:01:47 GMT):<br/>
open_wallet.cb  is the invalid parameter, somewhat the callback is different from the expected?

Hi! Please tell me what's `NYM`? What does it stand for?
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 13:13:30 GMT):<br/>
"Words ending in –nym are often used to describe different classes of words, and the relationships between words. The –nym literally means name, from the Greek onoma meaning name or word." @voddan 
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 13:16:12 GMT):<br/>
In indy, a NYM is a public information about an identity defined by a Did + Verkey.
</p>
<p><strong>Alexi</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 16:20:29 GMT):<br/>
@microinclude that's wierd. Is anyone else having the same invalidParam4 problem? or have suggestions on what to do? I tried re building the docker indy pool just in case, and I have not changed any of the indy sdk files yet it still is happening. so I have no idea what could be causing this problem to have suddenly started. Also on a side note, the write_did script uses the following command to create wallet

await wallet.create_wallet(pool_name, wallet_name, None, None, wallet_credentials) 

I am wondering why the create_wallet call takes in 5 parameters and what each of them does / what type they have to be. Maybe this will give some insight into why this error is occurring
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 17:53:48 GMT):<br/>
@Alexi The python wrapper you are using is out of date. The wallet API has changes since and has a new method signature for open and create. It is no longer dependent on pool name.
</p>
<p><strong>Alexi</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 20:56:44 GMT):<br/>
@tomislav  the wrapper I have seems to match with the one on the sdk github repo. Ill re-download and set up everything to be sure, but since the api has since changed this means the tutorials are deprecated so what would be the correct way to call create_wallet at this point? Same parameters as before but without the pool name?

I'm running the test on the nodejs wrapper using the current indy-sdk source. The first 4 tests pass but the next 8 fail due to PoolLedgerTimeout. Am I missing something? I'm running on the latest Ubuntu.
</p>
<p><strong>asmallfurrywombat</strong> (Wed, 15 Aug 2018 03:02:40 GMT):<br/>
I've also tried running the nodejs sample. Everything builds ok and the ledger appears to launch fine, but I get a DidAlreadyExistsError in response to the createAndStoreMyDid call on line 51 of gettingStarted.js . The indy_pool logs just show a 'Set uid to user ...'. The sdk innards appear to be rust. Out of idle curiosity, is there a recommended way to debug this issue?
</p>
<p><strong>microinclude</strong> (Wed, 15 Aug 2018 10:32:23 GMT):<br/>
hi @tomislav, the sdk i am using is from the master branch. I just tried this one on my code:

```config = json.dumps({"id": self.name})
        credentials = json.dumps({"key": self.key})
        await wallet.create_wallet(config, credentials)```
</p>
<p><strong>microinclude</strong> (Wed, 15 Aug 2018 10:33:33 GMT):<br/>
am i doing something wrong? i still have the CommonInvalid4 error
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 15 Aug 2018 13:33:15 GMT):<br/>
@asmallfurrywombat PoolLedgerTimeout most likely means your script can't access the IP of the pool containers. Check that both the pool and your script have the same genesis file (the IP inside it) and they are accessible. DidAlreadyExistsError means exactly that, did is already present in the wallet. Clean up any wallets by removing ~/.indy_client directory.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 15 Aug 2018 13:34:58 GMT):<br/>
@microinclude That's about right. Can you check if your installed libindy library is also of the latest version? One way to debug things is to add environment variable RUST_LOG=trace to your process
</p>
<p><strong>asmallfurrywombat</strong> (Wed, 15 Aug 2018 14:33:41 GMT):<br/>
thanks @tomislav .. removing ~/.indy_client got past line 51 :). Now it is dumping core on line 695 during a call to capi.cryptoAnonCrypt().  The core shows a SIGSEGV in libzmq.. will create an issue with the stack details.

What's the best way to help clean up outdated documentation in the hylerledger-indy repo, should it be done via PRs?
</p>
<p><strong>coderintherye</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 18:30:04 GMT):<br/>
for example https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/stable/getting-started.md references a command that doesn't exist, as well as purports to link to a doc about starting a pool, but actually links to something that has no such info
</p>
<p><strong>Alexi</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 19:28:32 GMT):<br/>
@coderintherye  yep documentation and README changes can be done through PR's and is always helpful as those kind of things are generally in a lower priority for the team when they are continually working on the project
</p>
<p><strong>microinclude</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 23:00:05 GMT):<br/>
@tomislav just missed this step:

Note: After building libindy, add the path containing the library the LD_LIBRARY_PATH andDYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables. This is necessary for dynamically linking your application with libindy. The dynamic linker will first check for the library in LD_LIBRARY_PATH if the library in your application doesn't include directory names. If the library in your application does include any directory name, then dynamic linker will search for the library in DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH (not LD_LIBRARY_PATH) so we recommend you set both variables to be safe.

Mybad... I'll update you once everything's working

Hi, is there any way to use Indy as login management for fabric ?
</p>
<p><strong>vtech</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 10:54:27 GMT):<br/>
Is communication between indy & fabric is possible ?

<p><strong>simonmullaney</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 11:07:39 GMT):<br/>
Hey guys just wondering if anyone here has any suggestions on what is the best option for setting up decentralised login functionality to my blockchain business network (business network setup on hyperledger composer which interacts with Hyperledger Fabric. My business network is then exposed as a REST server which my angular application interacts with.)

I know of Uport & Hyperledger Indy but was just wondering about pros and cons of both platforms and how easy it is to integrate a solution into your stack.

Any help is greatly appreciated 
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 12:28:00 GMT):<br/>
@simonmullaney Indy is a great fit for decentralized auth, biggest advantage over uport is the verifiable claims support provided by the SDK. However, project is still in incubation and there aren't many (if any) production ready solutions for this, such as uport. I am involved in one project that will tackle this, I'm happy to share some details with you if you're interested.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 12:28:52 GMT):<br/>
@vtech You can do DID Auth using Indy, essentially it comes down to proving an ownership over certain DID, which is super easy to implement with Indy

<p><strong>simonmullaney</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 12:32:45 GMT):<br/>
@tomislav absolutely if you could that would be great!

Just want to make sure one thing, when using predicate in proof request, this allow the prover not sending over the actual value of the credential correct? Prover is just sending over the proof that he has a credential that satisfies the predicate, and sending over not the actual credential

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 19:57:17 GMT):<br/>
@stanleyc-trustscience - correct. You should probably use the term "claim" in that phrase.  You receive claims in a credential, you prove claims in a proof.  If you use a predicate on a claim, you will get a proof of the claim meeting the predicate, but not the value.
</p>
<p><strong>stanleyc-trustscience</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 20:00:56 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran Nice, thank you! this is exciting :)
</p>
<p><strong>stanleyc-trustscience</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 20:04:02 GMT):<br/>
On a side note, I do see proof, credential, and claim being thrown around a bit .... now that you've clarify credential and claim, not sure about proof now lol
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 17 Aug 2018 20:31:14 GMT):<br/>
Early on claim and credential were used interchangeably (such that the W3C team call their group "Verifiable Claims" and couldn't change it later), but the terms are at different levels - a Credential contain Claims.  On the Proof side, you prove claims - at least in Indy.  Some other systems only support proving Credentials, which means you lose selective disclosure (only disclosing a subset of claims in a Credential) and ZKPs - e.g. the use of predicates.  So in Indy, a Proof involves proving a set of claims from one or more Credentials.

hey all, I have bee struggling since a recent update in the wallet API, the wrappers have reflected the change in that when creating a wallet it only takes two arguments. However when I try to create a wallet as such I keep getting type error stating I am missing 3 arguments (this pointing to before when the create wallet method took in 5 arguments) however adding the missing arguments leads to and invalid parameter error. according to me I have everything up to date, so I am unsure why I am getting this error. Anyone have any suggestions?

here is the full error after running this code: `await wallet.create_wallet(wallet_config, wallet_credentials)`

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "write_did.py", line 173, in <module>

the python code seems still to be the old one, i.e. indy-sdk. if you are using an IDE try to jump to the function definition to see which file it is
</p>
<p><strong>Alexi</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 20:30:45 GMT):<br/>
the python wrapper in my indy-sdk project is up to date with the repo, in it the method only takes in two parameters:

```
async def create_wallet(config: str,
                        credentials: str) -> None:
``` 
</p>
<p><strong>Alexi</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 20:46:46 GMT):<br/>
ok so I figured out what the problem was, I updated everything but `.../.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/indy` still had the old wrappers saved so I just copied the updated ones from indy-sdk into my sitepackages and this solved my problem. @baconsandwich thanks, your message made me stop and think that python was probably not looking at the correct libraries.

had some more questions out of curiosity to see how I can work with indy for the solution I am building
-now that wallet methods do not require pool name to work, will the wallet methods simply work in the context of the last 'opened' pool? How would you go about manipulating wallets in different pools?
-is there a way to list out the wallets in a pool?
-will closing/deleting a pool, by default close/delete the wallets associated with it?

What is meant by "walleted" entity? This term is used here for example: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/677a0439487a1b7ce64c2e62671ed3e0079cc11f/doc/design/002-anoncreds/anoncreds-workflow.svg
The diagram shows a normal issuer and a walleted issuer, a normal prover and a walleted prover. Is a walleted X the wallet of X?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 10:54:54 GMT):<br/>
@baconsandwich It means an Entity having access to the Wallet. For example, one can consider a use case where Issuer consist of two parts: internal (secure) one, which has access to the wallet, but doesn't have access to the network, and external one which doesn't have access to secure part (wallet, private keys, etc.) but has access to the network.
So, the current API supports separation of dealing with secrets and sending/exchanging data.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 14:09:54 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 14:52:24 GMT):<br/>
@ashcherbakov - is that supported today with the current ledger and libindy?  Since all transactions to the ledger have to be signed (I think, as a last step of constructing the transaction), doesn't that mean the entity that talks to the ledger must have access to a private key?  

Are there any examples in the test cases of this being used?
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 14:54:20 GMT):<br/>
I believe signing and sending are separate operations, there is a call `indy_sign` and a call `indy_submit`, so one party can sign it, and another can submit/send it. @gudkov?

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 18:55:04 GMT):<br/>
@ashcherbakov @gudkov - we're trying to come up with a way to launch our app without waiting for the next SLN upgrade, but we need to be on a 1.6 SDK.

Do you think we could take an Agent running on the 1.6 SDK (python), and when sending to the ledger, reorganize the message to match the current Ledger before signing and sending the message (and vice versa for reads)?  We would need to do that for a handful of DID, schema and CredDef creation.  Doable, impossible or worth trying because it might work?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=SCJgTLFhfuYTRkR3f) @swcurran Indy SDK 1.6 support both Node protocols. You can use it to send requests to Node with protocol version 1 and to Node with protocol version 2. There is a call set_protocol_version. The only problem for you is that your agent app should support both protocol versions, but i am not sure that it is complex as you need to use only few transactions.
</p>
<p><strong>gudkov</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 08:36:12 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=DPRYcmnyy2a7QHTnY) Indy SDK already provides simple abstraction layer over node protocol. For your request there is build method and corresponded parse method that will provide the same results independent on node protocol version. Most probably if your app uses methods like indy_build_get_schema_request/indy_parse_get_schema_response you are already ok and just need to write few lines of code to switch between protocol versions.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=DPRYcmnyy2a7QHTnY) Indy SDK already provides simple abstraction layer over node protocol. For each request there is build method and corresponded parse method that will provide the same results independent on node protocol version. Most probably if your app uses methods like indy_build_get_schema_request/indy_parse_get_schema_response you are already ok and just need to write few lines of code to switch between protocol versions.

Hey all

<p><strong>RubenLassau-Strauven</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 12:42:27 GMT):<br/>
Hey all
I'm currently experimenting with Indy and some things aren't clear.
I'm trying to build an app with Indy in Node.js and i'm trying to create a credential offer.
The problem I have is how do I get the credential definition ID for the credential definition I want to use for this offer?
In most tutorials these ID's are available from previous actions, but how am I supposed to retrieve them when they are not locally saved?
The only way I see how to do this is to send the buildSchemaRequest again, and then use the ID from the result to recreate the credential definition.
But this seems to be way too much work to do every time a credential offer has to be made for the same credential definition. 
Am I misunderstanding the use of schemas and credential definitions? Can someone provide some clarity?

@RubenLassau-Strauven You will need to persist the credential definition id you have created and use it later. You can use the non_secrets API to do this, or your own storage.

Hi Everyone I just joined this chat! I was trying out hyperledger indy.. read and got https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/getting-started/getting-started.md this example up on my local indy test network..  However the code of this example (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/samples/python/src/getting_started.py) does not have any NYM transaction's code (ledger.sign_and_submit_request), then how are did and other transactions getting added in the indy blockchain? How can I see the current state of my indy blockchian? Any cli commands to see the list of trasaction etc?
</p>
<p><strong>Tulika8</strong> (Sat, 01 Sep 2018 10:16:23 GMT):<br/>
Can someone please help me understand the basic concept of Indy. In the getting started example is it like ..Faber college and Acme maintain there own identity stores where they maintain the details of their users?
Alice, Acme and Faber have DID's in the blockchain and what ever trasactions are happening between them are recorded in the blockchain
that can be later used for proof?They also have public keys published in the blockchain that they can use later for proof?
When Alice makes a connection request with Faber they register there DID in the blockchain, but the transcript is passed on to Alice
through backchannel by encypting it with Alice public key ?

</p>
<p><strong>Tulika8</strong> (Sat, 01 Sep 2018 10:16:23 GMT):<br/>
I ran sample java program Annoncreds.java and have put a sleep of 5 mins in the end of this class before it deletes all walets etc. Before it deletes these wallets , I run wallet list command on indy-cli and I get a message that no open wallet present. PLeas elet me know why its so? This command should list the wallets opened  or dids in created in the AnonCreds,java?

Hi everyone!
I am a beginner to Indy and had a look at its principle at https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/rc/doc/getting-started/getting-started.md
I have a doubt. Suppose in the Alice example, if Alice had to store her picture as part of her credential,  is it possible in Indy? Can we store an image as  a credential in the identity record?

@trthhrtz That's actually what I've been reading, but it isn't clear to me how a verkey is created. It talks about verkeys in "abbreviated form" in one section, and it introduces verkeys as "The most important fields of this transaction are dest (target DID), role (role of a user NYM record being created for) and the verkey (target verification key)." but doesn't explain what exactly a verkey is. By analogy, I've seen verkey described as the "public key" in pub/priv key pair. But I'd like to see more detail: like, is it the DID concatenated with a random string?

Another question: I've been listening to Drummond Reed present about DPKS on ssimeetup.org and in the section about social recovery of private keys, he talks about "trustees" as the preferred name for friends or family who are willing to provide this service for you. Is this "trustee" different from the role of "trustee" in Indy? e.g. "Roles.TRUSTEE" here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/indy_common/roles.py

Please check out the stackoverflow proposal for questions concerning Indy (that would include sovrin, vcx, etc) 
https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/120021/hyperledger-indy?referrer=2Kckofvf6W-eWWrqyLlr9A2
I think that if there are some well defined questions in a contextual and better searchable place we can better develop SSI applications based on indy

How is a new identity created in Sovrin/Indy? For instance, in ethereum's ERC-725, a new smart contract must be deployed (expensive); in uPort, a new ethereum address is created (free). What is the minimum set of things needed in Indy (trust anchor, money, connection to internet?)

Hi, I've been trying to make an client using the python indy-sdk. I've been following on the How-Tos https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/doc/how-tos. I am able to save the trust anchor DID and steward DID to a wallet, however, I do not see how to retrieve those DIDs from the user's wallet to make transactions (such as rotating keys). Does the DIDs need to be persisted outside of a wallet?

As I get to know more about this project, it seems that this project is based on a combination of the following features:
1.  DID [Open Standards]
2.  JSON Document
3.  Zero Knowledge Proof [Though I have yet figured out which Zero Knowledge Proof Lib it is using]
4.  Selective Disclosure of Information
5.  Underlying Ledger using BFT

Am I right to say that excluding point 5, point 1-4 can be replicated and write to other types of Ledger or am I missing out something here.
What I can see is that the designated ledger resolves scalability issues (at the point of this project development a few years back) and the Trust Framework that governs any information placed on the network.
With Hedera HashGraph launching soon, does it make sense to leverage on that ledger as the underlying ledger given that Hashgraph claims to have solve the throughput and scaling issues?

I am having trouble understanding how to get either the DID or Verkey of a steward after wallet creation. I am using the Indy python sdk
</p>
<p><strong>Dubh3124</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 09:14:13 GMT):<br/>
I figured out a way to get the DID from created wallet. When creating a wallet I used set_did_metadata to set some kind of identifier then  wrote a function to basically run list_my_dids_with_meta which returns a list of did/metadata json object in which you can parse for the metadata identifier and return the did in the json object.

Create wallet function
```
    async def create_wallet(self, wallet_config, wallet_credentials):
        print_log('\n3. Creating new secure wallet\n')
        try:
            await wallet.create_wallet(wallet_config, wallet_credentials)
            wallet_handle = await wallet.open_wallet(wallet_config, wallet_credentials)
            pool_handle = await pool.open_pool_ledger(config_name=self.pool_name, config=None)

            steward_did, steward_verkey = await self._generate_steward_DID(wallet_handle)
            await did.set_did_metadata(wallet_handle, steward_did, json.dumps({'Name': 'Steward'}))

```

Hi, I am in the Hyperledger Identity working group. We are putting together a white-paper about the Digital Identity on blockchains. The target audience of this white paper are people who are just getting into the Identity world. 

I would like to ask the following question with regard to Indy. Any insight will be great. Our goal is to help people understand more about the fast changing landscape.

1. What is the key differentiator of Indy?
2. How is privacy handled? Where does PII reside in your solution and how is it protected? From correlation attacks?
3. How do you address the “Username/Password” issue? Meaning people have to maintain too many passwords and the fact that passwords are not secure.
4. How do you address interoperability with existing identity systems (LDAP and Active Directory)?
5. What are the special features that make your solution fit well within a blockchain context?

@maydar - I think the proxy could be a problem.  It's probably limiting what ports are open and indy needs some non-standard ports open for this conversation.  I run this on a Linux VM and it worked fine.  Can you try it on another environment without the proxy?

2. it is always fun to learn a new language
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 16:55:30 GMT):<br/>
@PhillipGibb : I was the one who wrote the original spec for indy-sdk, and stipulated that Rust would be the implementation language. We knew we needed something that was c-callable, so we could wrap it easily in many different languages. Our main choices were C/C++, Go, Rust, and maybe D. We discounted D as not having the momentum we wanted. We seriously considered Go but ended up choosing Rust because we didn't believe Go's natural concurrency model was right for us, and because we liked Rust's correctness guarantees, LLVM backend, and so forth. An extra plus was that some crypto libraries were available in a Rust flavor.

Can anyone help explain why indy is being built with a blockchain behind it? It seems strange that the blockchain needs to be setup and maintained by one entity (so there's really a central system admin) and that all changes require consultation and updates across the network (otherwise you risk forks). Plenum surely can't scale to handle large numbers of nodes and high volumes of writes per second (no consensus algorithm fares convincingly well for business needs), and given that all bllckchains are centrally administered anyway why can't there just be a central database instead of a blockchain for Indy?

From the white paper, https://www.evernym.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/What-Goes-On-The-Ledger.pdf, the revocation registries are published by the issuer and stored in Sovrin. How fast (and big) does the revocation registration grow? If 1000s of claims are revoked, what are the implications on the run time performance during validation/verification?

where is the directory and ledger file (in the peer)? 
the kind of data and transactions its been written to the ledger?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 26 Sep 2018 01:12:02 GMT):<br/>
@ShivVenkatraman - the bigger performance hit for revocation occurs at Credential Definition Creation time, so it's a one time cost.  The more credentials you plan to issue, the longer it will take.  The next longest time, which will not be long, is creating the proof.  The verifier just has to review the Proof and verify that the "Proof of non-Revocation" is sufficiently recent.   Note that the number of credentials that can be issued is set at Credential Definition creation time - a new Cred Def may have to be created if you run out.

FYI - we found the Cred Def with revocation took a REALLY long time to create when the code has DEBUG turned off.  Without that, it's relatively fast.  Still takes awhile - lots of crypto-math - but not intolerable for a one time event. 
</p>
<p><strong>ShivVenkatraman</strong> (Wed, 26 Sep 2018 01:41:27 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=p6MrBK8HW2aNxYFwL) @swcurran Thanks @swcurran. Can revocation be done at attribute level? Suppose my credential schema has attributes name, age, height. Can revocation be done just for age or is it done for the entire credential?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 26 Sep 2018 01:59:59 GMT):<br/>
No - revocation is on a credential.  However, our expectation is that the revocation feature will be used a lot more the changed data, not necessarily to take something away. Thus, if a single claim changed, you would revoke the current credential, and issue a new one.  For example - A Driver's License - when you move to a new address, you revoke the old one, and issue a new one with the new address.  Beats the sticker that they currently give out when you move.  I had the sticker on a my licence for 3 years once!

Hi All, quick question. I am working on a PoC and have about a week to get the blockchain piece done. I want to use indy as the project deals with identity. I know the HLF inside and out, but I don't want to use Fabric any more unless I really have to. Before jumping to Ethereum, I want to know, from your experience, how involved is the process in getting a simple indy-based service up and running with some restful APIs to issue identities?

There is a natural design tension. The code itself can't know _a priori_ how big the registry is going to need to be, and it costs to make it bigger. So what I've done is to have a rev reg size parameter at cred def creation for an override of default behaviour. The default behaviour for `von_anchor.Issuer` is to start with a smaller registry of size 256, and double it every time it fills, up to size 4096. I use a numeric value, incrementing with rev reg cardinality, to track what the next size ought to be by default. It's a heuristic; any implementation can choose its own way forward here.

You don't have to track the size of the revocation registry: indy-sdk will raise `ErrorCode.AnoncredsRevocationRegistryFullError` when you try to create a new credential on a full revocation registry.

I am researching how different consensus algorithms handle "fair ordering" of transactions. Specifically, I am interested in if and how protocols handle nodes ordering transactions in a way that unfairly benefits them, or even generating and inserting new transactions where it benefits them. In lottery-style algorithms, I believe this is just ignored because the probability of winning when a node wants to is low. With leader-style algorithms that maintain a single leader for an extended time, such as PBFT and rBFT, it seems like this is more important. Does anyone know if rBFT or Plenum monitor that the leader is including transactions within a reasonable amount of time or that it isn't unfairly ordering the transactions to benefit itself?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=FsHbKKoSsvqtEvdmc) @adamludvik RBFT runs several instances of the protocol and there is only one instance (known beforehand) called the master instance whose execution affects the ledger. Each instance has its own leader and the leader of the master instance can be changed if it performs significantly worse than other instances. Now if this leader was ordering txns in the batch in an unfair manner, it will lose some performance and might get replaced. 
There are other protocols like HoneyBadger where users send encrypted txns so nodes cannot do favouritism. Another interesting one is Helix by http://www.orbs.com. Here users send encrypted txns and the nodes use threshold decryption to decrypt the txns, this way it ensures that nodes can't see the txn content unless the block is finalised.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=WKM6e4NzXKtrJ6cMX) @adamludvik By replicas, i assume you mean replicas on other nodes, then no. It is possible but would be expensive to ensure
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 15:53:15 GMT):<br/>
I think withholding transactions could be checked by either the secondaries in a single instance of the protocol or when comparing the orderings generated by the different instances. Are neither of these checking for this behavior? Does a client have any recourse if it sees that a leader is ignoring its transactions?
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 16:01:38 GMT):<br/>
Yes, secondaries can check but its expensive to make that check, each secondary sends the txn to the primary and get a signed acknowledgement from the primary, the primary if does not include the txn in a batch under a timeout, then the secondariness share the signed acknowledgement with each other. "orderings generated by the different instances" is not enough since the primary can choose not to participate in any instance for that txn. As of now the client has no recourse
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 16:04:16 GMT):<br/>
But if we have signed acknowledgements from the node to the client, the client can share that with other nodes and complain
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 16:08:36 GMT):<br/>
Currently, we don't separate consensus from execution but if we separate consensus from execution then having encrypted txns makes more sense to ensure fairness. If we had simpler txns then we can use snarks to prove that encrypted txns are actually correct and will execute correctly, that will let us keep consensus and execution combined

I am not sure whether this line of code is correct or not in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/samples/python/src/getting_started.py line 828
`assert sender_verkey == await did.key_for_did(pool_handle, from_wallet, to_from_did)`

From the setup dev document, this line of code should looks like
```
# Steward Agent    
faber_verkey = await did.key_for_did(pool_handle, from_wallet, faber_did_info['did'])
```

So whether to_from_did is the same as faber_did_info['did]? I think this DID should be faber's Verinym DID but not the connection DID.

hi @lovesh, when I execute "sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 68DB5E88" this command, it returned below timeout error:
```
gpg: requesting key 68DB5E88 from hkp server keyserver.ubutntu.com
gpg: keyserver timed out
gpg: keyserver receive failed: keyserver error
```

Whether this is my local network issue or something wrong for keyserver.ubuntu.com?

hi @lovesh , I have some more questions after reading the get start document, could you please provide your comments for these questions? Thanks.
1. Whether the credential verifier will store the credential in their wallet? For example, Acme will request some credentials from Alice, such as first name, last name, ssn, etc. Once Alice provide the proof for this(proof also includes Alice's first name, last name, ssn, etc), whether the verifier Acme will store this information into its wallet? If yes, what is the difference between this new personal information storing with traditional database storing, which means Acme stored this information in their own company's database
2. Alice found there are two credentials can meet Loan-Application-KYC Proof Request(one was provided from Faber, the other was provided from Acme), how does she choose which credential she will use as the proof? This was not mentioned in the documentation

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=dkPeDRXBZWw9RE7cX) @greg2git We need a key value store for persistence. Rocksdb is not a hard dependency, you can change the config file to work with leveldb but that will be suboptimal
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 20:17:15 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=qkPTEgky9HR7ACBZh) @lijiachuan Hi. 
1. Alice does not transfer the credential to the verifier Acme but only a proof computed from the credential. Acme might store this information but they cannot use this info to create another proof to give to another verifier. 
2. Alice will look at the proof request and then decide which credential needs to be used. This decision will be influenced by conditions in the proof request, so the proof request can specify that it needs proof of age only from a certain credential or certain issuer or proof of age from a credential that specifies the social security number or something similar

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 09 Oct 2018 18:09:08 GMT):<br/>
@dono list out your questions and I'll try to get back ASAP
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 09 Oct 2018 18:09:08 GMT):<br/>
@dono could you add your questions here and I'll try to get back ASAP (@ me for faster responses)
</p>
<p><strong>dono</strong> (Tue, 09 Oct 2018 18:14:01 GMT):<br/>
 @kdenhartog Thanks, I was trying to run pytest on the SDK Python tests and was receiving a bunch of errors, most of them being function not found errors. I'm running Windows and set my Path environment variable to point to libindy_1.6.7/lib, python3-indy is properly installed with pip. Am I missing something? For now I'm trying it out on a Ubuntu 16.04 vm
</p>
<p><strong>haggs</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 01:57:09 GMT):<br/>
Have a stack trace by chance Dono? Did you try Pip3?
</p>
<p><strong>haggs</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 01:58:00 GMT):<br/>
@dono When you go to `python -v` in your unix terminal (not command prompt, something like git bash or the like) what happens? Same with pip
</p>
<p><strong>haggs</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 01:58:17 GMT):<br/>
I'd post the errors regardless!
</p>
<p><strong>dono</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 02:26:16 GMT):<br/>
hey @haggs I get a lot of import statements and at the end Python 3.7.1rc1 (v3.7.1rc1:2064bcf6ce, Sep 26 2018, 15:15:36) [MSC v.1914 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

</p>
<p><strong>dono</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 02:29:19 GMT):<br/>
when I type pip -v i get the standard help output
</p>
<p><strong>dono</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 02:29:34 GMT):<br/>
I've been using git bash so no need to worry about that
</p>
<p><strong>haggs</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 02:43:44 GMT):<br/>
@dono, I doubt it matters, but the current version of the python wrapper requires 3.6 vs 3.7.  3.7 Is quite new (a month or two) so I would recommending downgrading from your release candidate (3.7.*1rc1*) to 3.6
</p>
<p><strong>haggs</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 02:44:30 GMT):<br/>
Mind posting the errors for functions?
</p>
<p><strong>haggs</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 02:44:50 GMT):<br/>
Also maybe try `pip3`?
</p>
<p><strong>dono</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 02:45:22 GMT):<br/>
well its a lot of output, I can take a screenshot of what fits on one page length
</p>
<p><strong>dono</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 02:45:34 GMT):<br/>
pip3 -v does the same thing
</p>
<p><strong>haggs</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 02:46:18 GMT):<br/>
Do you have Docker or just a VirtualBox?

I was using Docker when this issue happened, but I don't think it matters because it doesn't seem to be a problem with connecting to the local pool i ran, but gimmie a sec i'm getting the screenshot now

'To run on your machine, make sure you have docker, cd into this directory, and then build the image:

$ py -m pip --version
pip 18.1 from C:\Users\Brandon\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.6)

</p>
<p><strong>dono</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 03:03:57 GMT):<br/>
wont let me run pip without py -m and git bash wont recognize python, python3, or py3 as a command only py
</p>
<p><strong>haggs</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 03:04:28 GMT):<br/>
Try adding it to your shell
</p>
<p><strong>haggs</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 03:04:33 GMT):<br/>
Or restarting your shell
</p>
<p><strong>dono</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 03:04:41 GMT):<br/>
I did select install py launcher during install which is probably why
</p>
<p><strong>dono</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 03:05:00 GMT):<br/>
should I remove and add python to Path just incase
</p>
<p><strong>haggs</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 03:05:18 GMT):<br/>
If it's pointing to a different library version, then yes
</p>
<p><strong>dono</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 03:05:50 GMT):<br/>
well it can only be pointing to 3.6.6 because thats all i have installed right now
</p>
<p><strong>haggs</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 03:06:30 GMT):<br/>
Well assuming your env vars updated, a restart might help but a `--python --version` should be for sure

python and python3 not recognized as commands still, let me check my Path

First I installed latest python 3.7.1rc1 using Windows executable installer, using recommended settings and selecting add Python to Path. installed the required pip packages, python3-indy and asyncio I can't remember the exact command but I'm pretty sure I only had to enter *pip install*, not *py -m pip install*. Then I downloaded latest stable release of libindy for Windows and unzipped into a directory in Program Files, pointed Path to it - C:\Program Files\libindy_1.6.7\lib Then I git cloned indy-sdk, built the indy-pool.dockerfile image, and ran indy_pool image on loopback exactly as they show to do. Finally I cd over to indy-sdk/wrappers/python ran the command *pytest* nothing else and I got the output shown.

My only guess is that you installed release channel and another release channel https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk#windows. @nhelmy  May be able to help, but in general running a docker version of `libindy` .  Tough to say as I don't own a windows machine.  I'll look again tomorrow.  I'll leave this for reference: `pip3 install -U pip`, https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/windows-build.md is your best bet, I'll check back through tomorrrow and possibly do a screenshare as I'm stumped myself.  A VM or cloud ubuntu box might make it easier, still a correct Docker setup should mitigate most of this besides network mapping.  Best of luck!

hi, I have one question about where to host the wallet for individual user, normally when we talk about a digital wallet, that will be a mobile application, but from the get started example, sometimes the initial connection might be triggered from a website, such as Alice click "Get Transcript" button on Faber's website, this makes the communication between website and mobile app difficult, if Alice is using a web browser in her laptop. So I would like to get some best practice what is the best way to build the wallet for individual user and organization
</p>
<p><strong>haggs</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 13:30:17 GMT):<br/>
Ah yes @sklump  forgot about that.  I downgraded to `pip 9.0.3`
</p>
<p><strong>haggs</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 13:31:59 GMT):<br/>
`sudo pip install --force-reinstall pip==9.0.3` @dono 
</p>
<p><strong>dono</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 19:38:18 GMT):<br/>
@haggs @sklump  I've tried your suggestions, it didn't change anything. @twshelton and I have been trying to find the root cause and we think it is an issue with libindy not recognizing/finding dependencies on my system

This is my first time building Indy locally and running the test. as of now, when I run the test using the guide on this location (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/ubuntu-build.md), I have a failing test case (test ledger_demo_works ...FAILED ). I am building the master branch as of now. 

Does anybody has a hint?

hi, I followed this start node guideline step 1, https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/start-nodes.md
"Install Indy Node", I complete running that 4 lines of command in Ubuntu, and when I try to run the next step "Initialize Node to be included into the Network", it has one description about updating the network name in config file "NETWORK_NAME={network_name} where {network_name} matches the one in genesis transaction files above", but I didn't generate any genesis transaction files before this, anyone can let me know where is the step guide to generate it?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=2PEM45s3Q9k2zmr4Q) @sandeepsethia62 That error is likely because the tests were unable to connect to a local pool network. This is done using docker typically. Instructions can be found in the indy-sdk main README.

@sandeepsethia62 - we (BC Gov) are running Indy using Postgres for wallet storage.  @ianco is currently working on a PR to indy-sdk to add a pluggable wallet implementation based on that work.  Stay tuned - should be a PR in about a week.

Hi all. Based on this script (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/getting-started/getting-started.ipynb), I have rewritten the story until "Alice -> Store 'Job-Certificate' Credential", with NodeJs SDK wrapper, and separating each actors (Steward, Alice, Faber and Acme) in different processes, especially to separate operations for each actor, and to implement (and show) communications and data exchanged between actors. All is packaged to run in different docker containers, with "make" commands to simply run the script. I think it can be interesting to share it, as example (demo). And I can share it :-) . But the question is who or where ? Perhaps it could be integrated in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk with a pull request ? Or elsewhere ? What do you think about ? Thanks :-) [posted on #indy and #indy-sdk ]

Right now it only supports Python development, but I'm planning on getting all the wrappers supported.

<p><strong>xnopre</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 12:42:58 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog Effectively, there are different subjects (interests) in my project. 
1/ I can share information to run NodeJs script in indy environment, or contribute in your project
2/ My scripts (1 for each actor of the story) are samples for how using NodeJs SDK Indy wrapper
3/ And the entire project show communication and data between each actors (no present in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/getting-started/getting-started.ipynb)

My question is how/where to share this to be visible and foundable by a maximum of indy SDK users. For example, I didn't known your repo. So where is the best place to share this code to be visible and foundable by future indy SDK users ? Perhaps in "official" indy SDK repo ? What is the opinion of others ? Thanks :-)
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 16:05:17 GMT):<br/>
This sounds like it might be a good getting started guide for the Indy-agents repository specifically the NodeJS reference agent. @mhailstone any thoughts on pulling something like this in to have an example of agents communicating?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 16:05:54 GMT):<br/>
@xnopre at the very least, adding a reference to the Indy wiki would be useful, so others can find it.

I think we need to consider a better getting started guide for the agent community complimentary to the getting started content for indy-sdk pages in GitHub. I'm hoping next week's call will be a springboard for some of that.

@kdenhartog Running the indy-dev image you provided, when I get into the shell the home directory is empty. Can't cd python, did you mean to git clone indy-sdk and then run the getting started?

<p><strong>dono</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 23:09:59 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog I created a virtual machine so that I have more control and followed the sequence of actions from your indy-dev dockerfile. Ran getting started and everything finished without error. But running pytest inside the indy-sdk/wrappers/python directory shows many errors with all test modules. Is it just cause they haven't been updated and I should ignore them, or is there something I'm missing?

Hey, this might be a dumb question, but after working with indy for a few months I just wondered: **Why do we even need a DID?** It's the first 16 bytes of the verification key. Why not just use that? Yeah, it's longer but its the "source" of the identity and isn't this breaking DRY? The only advantage I can see is that the DID is shorter and therefore more human readable.

ok, that makes sense. so DID is derived "arbitrarily" from the original verkey, but looses this relation as soon as the verkey is changed.

@baconsandwich   The DID can be arbitrarily set from the original verkey first 16 bits OR explicitly provided.  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/4e8d9a47e2a7d0368c26c26c0209caa6965c7b60/libindy/src/api/did.rs#L21, but at its heart it's essentially trustless.

After key rotation a DID pairwise connection in a secured wallet can keep track of those changes and be decentrally owned and signed.  At least...that's my understanding of it! Hope that helps :D

I have another question about how to self-issue some identities. For example, for such as user's first name, last name or birth of date this type of information, based on current reality, we can not request any organization to use the new technology and issue this information to user, so in my mind, user should have one something like a "self-issued" identities and can use it in later, is there such as concept in Indy?

<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 04:23:26 GMT):<br/>
I think the get start document is based on Faber already has basic information of Alice, so they can issue the credential directly to Alice, but just in case if there is no such organization/user/thing can know this initially, how should we handle the initialization

The scenario should be like this, there is one open market, it has one pre-defined schema/definition, anyone can register in this market and only basic claims will be shared in this market, only when one user wants to connect, then the registered user will decide whether share details or not.

What is more interesting is that following your repo to install the containers and run the demo, I get the same error

I was finally able to run the demo. The thing is I had made my indy_pool image from the dockerfile of the latest commit of indy-sdk and it was not working. But using the indy_pool build from @kdenhartog dockerfile, it seems to work perfectly. Can't figure out why this is the case

I have a question regarding pairwise DIDs, if this is a good place to ask.
</p>
<p><strong>theoturner</strong> (Thu, 18 Oct 2018 15:12:51 GMT):<br/>
Is there potential for network spam?

If I'm not mistaken, received requests are recorded at endpoints even if the request is not accepted. As such, could a malicious actor not make continued connection requests to a target, forcing each one to be recorded?

Additionally, if an adversary were to set up both sides of a connection (i.e. both sides of the pairwise DID), is there potential for network spam by continually changing the pairwise DID?

Perhaps this is DKMS open issue #8? https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/design/005-dkms/DKMS%20Design%20and%20Architecture%20V3.md#11-open-issues

@arjunkhera it has to do with docker network config stuff. When using the docker compose stuff a network is generated on docker, where as witg mine I'm relying on the images using the host network and just changing ports.

@arjunkhera it has to do with docker network config stuff. When using the docker compose stuff a network is generated with docker-compose while mine is relying on the images using the host network and just changing ports. As far as the 112 error it happens because the SDK and the pool ledger have to be in sync for data being passed back and forth and how the data and APIs are structured.

@twshelton was it a 307 or a 306 error. I haven't seen a 307 error yet, but I'd be curious to figure out why it's not working. If its the 306 error, its because the .indy_client repo thats created needs to be deleted. I need to change the guides so thats done automatically at the beginning instead.

Can someone justify why it is not advisable send the verkey together with the DID in a connection request. I'm referring to the Step 4, point 5 in the Getting Started Guide (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/getting-started/getting-started.md#explore-the-code). Instead, the DID and the verkey are first stored in the ledger to be later searched by the Faber, something that could be done directly. What am I missing?

I have a question. When i run this code(https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/samples/python/src/anoncreds.py),  i find that Prover and issuer don't connect with each other. Prover's funtcion use the issuer's information directly. So if prover and issuer use two clients , are there any api i can use to communite in the jdk ? Or i should reach it by myself?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=Mxf8JCTBs4Z9P8jFi) @Abdul_khaliq fabric may be your first choice. U can't write the smart contract in Indy. It just for  decentralize identity.   Your can read the docs about fabric(https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/) .Python is supported by fabric

Install Rust and rustup (https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html).

Install required native libraries and utilities:

apt-get update && \
apt-get install -y \
   build-essential \
   pkg-config \
   cmake \
   libssl-dev \
   libsqlite3-dev \
   libzmq3-dev \
   libncursesw5-dev
libindy requires the modern 1.0.14 version of libsodium but Ubuntu 16.04 does not support installation it's from apt repository. Because of this, it requires to build and install libsodium from source:

cd /tmp && \
  curl https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/libsodium-1.0.14.tar.gz | tar -xz && \
   cd /tmp/libsodium-1.0.14 && \
   ./configure --disable-shared && \
   make && \
   make install && \
   rm -rf /tmp/libsodium-1.0.14
Build libindy

git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk.git
cd ./indy-sdk/libindy
cargo build
cd ..

I run this docker file https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/libindy/ci/ubuntu.dockerfile
and already setup the indy network
I am getting error while executing the command Run integration tests: Start local nodes pool with Docker

If you use this method then you have to specify the TEST_POOL_IP as specified below when running the tests.

It can be useful if we want to launch integration tests inside another container attached to the same docker network.

Run tests

cd libindy
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test
It is possible to change ip of test pool by providing of TEST_POOL_IP environment variable:

RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 TEST_POOL_IP=10.0.0.2 cargo test
Build indy-cli (Optional)

indy-cli is dependent on libindy and should be built after it.

cd cli/
RUSTFLAGS=" -L ../libindy/target/debug" cargo build
If you have followed the instructions to build libindy above, the default build type will be debug

Make sure to add the libindy to the path. Replace /path/to with the actual path to the libindy directory. Using bash:

echo "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/libindy/target/{BUILD TYPE}" >> ~/.bashrc
sudo ldconfig
source ~/.bashrc
To run indy-cli, navigate to cli/target/debug and run ./indy-cli

I have another question relating to a current demo we're trying to create based on the Getting Started walkthrough.  This involves a user purchasing an item from a retailer.  The retailer will initiate the onboarding via a QR code.  We are stumped as to how the user then accesses the retailers verkey in order to encrypt their response.  In our implementation, using verkey = keyForDid(poolHandle, userWalletHandle, retailerDid) fails with walletItemNotFound 212.  Whereas in the Getting Started example, using the toWallet (ie userWallet) succeeds.  Any thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>Paul-TAB</strong> (Mon, 22 Oct 2018 15:41:29 GMT):<br/>
I should add that we suppose the retailers verkey can be retrieved on the user side because previously the retailer wrote it to the ledger using *their* wallet
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Mon, 22 Oct 2018 16:12:02 GMT):<br/>
GET_NYM returns a structure like
```
{
        "dest": "V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUZ6f",
        "identifier": null,
        "role": "0",
        "seqNo": 123,
        "txnTime": null,
        "verkey": "~KoRVR13DVYsWPtK8uAzNbx"
    }
```
Just peel out the verkey from the JSON.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Mon, 22 Oct 2018 16:12:31 GMT):<br/>
You do have to keep track of DIDs for parties of interest.
</p>
<p><strong>louisk</strong> (Mon, 22 Oct 2018 16:52:39 GMT):<br/>
why GET_NYM instead of KEY_FOR_DID ? (if you already have the DID for retailer in this case)
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Mon, 22 Oct 2018 17:09:07 GMT):<br/>
Sure, KEY_FOR_DID is probably better

@ShubhamSingh18 - the https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent repo contains examples of python and nodejs agents.

As well, this README - https://github.com/swcurran/education/blob/master/LFS171x/indy-material/nodejs/README.md - provides an easy to use example of a point in time version of the nodejs agent, including how to build, run and walk through the demo that you can run in a browser or on your laptop.

@MALodder - question.  When a verifier gets a proof that contains claims from multiple credentials, can the verifier tell if the same linked secret was used to prove that different claims?

Hello Everyone, I highly appreciate if anyone can give me guide one this. Think if a person without having any verifiable credential(VC) initially. How that person going to get first VC from a issuer. How identity owner going to verify it is him/her. Do we have to have physical contact with the issuing entity? What are the possible solutions for this matter? (Does indy have a solution for this?) Thank you.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=6Xfc6cA889Aq2AApX) @arunwij As per my understanding, Alice use case has mentioned such scenerio, so what happen exactly is, Alice ( Person) establish trust with the issuing organisation though either physical contact or using email or any medium of contact. Once Entity verify Alice, then it start onboarding process of Alice over Indy network and hence issue verifiable claims to her.

<p><strong>arunwij</strong> (Thu, 25 Oct 2018 04:34:07 GMT):<br/>
@shyam 40 Thank you for the reply. Don't you think if we contact a person with email or other digital mechanism, there is a chance to impersonate the identity owner by another party? Physically meeting a issuer is may not feasible, other wise we still have to depend on our traditional identity methods like identity cards. What are your thoughts? 
</p>
<p><strong>Shyam_Pratap_Singh</strong> (Thu, 25 Oct 2018 04:46:01 GMT):<br/>
Initially some how , you have to establish a relationship with any of the TrustAnchor for eg. In India you might visit to nearby Aadhar center and show your current available identity , then Aadhar center based on initial proof, start process of onboarding to Sovrin Network.

Hi all. I'm setup our new Steward node on Sovrin :-) . My application is using the SDK, and connects the ledger loading a "pool transactions genesis" file, containing information about some nodes on the ledger. OK. But I don't really understand why we need to have a Steward node to connect the ledger knowing that our node (IP and port) are not in the genesis file. Where can I found information or schemas to understand this point ? Thanks

@ShubhamSingh18 No interest to share my code. My question is very general. Is it needed to have a "Sovrin validator node" to be able to link my application to the "live" Sovrin ledger ? I thought that my application will communicate to my Sovrin node, but apparently not, the IP address of my node is note in the genesis file loaded by my application to communicate with Sovrin ledger.... ??

@xnopre ... you can change the genesis file to point to your local node and not use the Sovrin network for development purposes.  Can you provide some more information on how you configured your environment and the environment itself (OSX, Linux, Windows)?  Then we can help you get everything connected.

@twshelton Sorry, it seems I'm not so clear in my question. I have no problem to connect to ledger (no yet tested). I'm doing the setup of my Sovrin Steward node, and I try to understand the link (if there is one) between connecting the Sovrin ledger, and the need to have a Steward node ? Why is it needed (or not ?) to have a Steward node to be able to use the ledger ? cc @ShubhamSingh18

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=mrHTEXqEo3MAuuoMd) @ShubhamSingh18 Indy is a python-based daemon that runs on linux and implements a byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithm to protect the integrity of writes to the ledger. The ledger storage uses RocksDB. Does that answer your question? Or could you be more specific?

<p><strong>andrewtan</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 02:14:24 GMT):<br/>
Do have a question and hope this community can help to share some insights.  With MyCUID, I believe there will be credentials issued to the client's MyCUID Wallet.  If the same client is also having the wallet for BC Gov's VON's Network for example or other SSI Wallets, how does he or she used a mixture of credentials across different wallets for a specific purpose?  If the different credentials from different issuers are all stored in the same wallet, I can see that happening easily but across multiple wallets, how will that works?  Any document or links that explains more on that will be helpful.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 04:13:01 GMT):<br/>
Not sure about MyCUID wallet, but we aren't planning a wallet for VON. We're assuming that vendors will create wallets that work with VON Issuer/Verifier Services. This points to the importance of interoperability in the community. 

That said, we do think that a Wallet that supports extensions - eg an app store-type ecosystem - would enable done pretty amazing capabilities. 

As you note, we don't think each Service Provider will have their own Agent/Wallet.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=reDmk5DZrhxWQd9Ah) @theoturner Pairwise DIDs will mostly be written to microledgers, so they impose little or no burden on the global, public ledger. Further, even if there is no microledger (every DID must be written to the global, public ledger), a connection request does not automatically result in a connection acceptance that creates a DID. You only end up creating a DID when the connection is accepted. Now, if every client decides to accept all connection requests and then evaluate whether they're desirable, after the fact, then the potential for spam exists as you have imagined it. The disincentive for doing this is the cost of writing a DID.

DIDs are not rotated, so I don't see any potential for abuse related to "continually changing the pairwise DID." Unless you mean, continually rotating the public key associated with a DID? As with other ledger writes, this write operation will have a cost, which provides a built-in disincentive to such spam.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=oLSZPbsWnt2JXSLhQ) @xnopre You don't need a validator node to use Indy, any more than you need to be a bank operating an ATM to be able to use ATM machines. Your application communicates with *all* validator nodes, not just one that you operate. If you're not operating a node, then your application communicates with other nodes; it doesn't need anything local.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=4H74Y2KNzfYgdDCaz) @ShivVenkatraman Consensus is used to order transactions, impose timestamps, and harmonize the view of what is on the ledger. It has no direct relationship to claims/credentials. A credential is not agreed upon by validator nodes; rather, a credential is an independent JSON-based doc that validator nodes don't care about--but it is digitally signed using a private key for which the corresponding public key, credential definition, and DID are stored on the ledger.

The consensus algorithm is somewhat decoupled from the rest of the system, but this decoupling is not crisp enough that another consensus algorithm like Tendermint could be plugged in out-of-the-box. However, there are active discussions about plugging in other consensus algorithms, so this decoupling is likely to get crisper in coming months.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=2u9E9Nd5GR84oJ3tQ) @arunwij Arun: the assumption is that issuers don't give credentials unless they have some reason to do so--and that this reason includes some basis for trust. If the credential is issued by a bank, then the person receiving the credential is likely a bank customer, and the bank has policies and procedures in place to identify their customer and decide what their customer's attributes are. For example, the bank probably has a secure website where its customers can login and receive a credential. Similarly, if the issuer is an educational institution, it knows its students and has some sort of secure communication mechanism with them. Or if the issuer is a government, it knows its citizens and has some mechanism for determining whether it should issue credentials to them.

The scenario you seem to be focusing on is one that seems extremely unlikely to me: two parties who have never interacted in any way want to begin their association by having one give the other a credential. Why would that ever be useful? What seems far more likely to me is that two parties who have never interacted create a relationship and then, AFTER trust accumulates in that relationship, one of the parties gives the other a credential on the basis of the trust that has accumulated. For example, two parties that do not know one another conduct some business on eBay--and the resulting credential states that party A was a good customer for party B. It cannot state that party A has a known name or bank balance, since the relationship never involved evidence of those things--but it can state that A paid promptly and was pleasant to work with, and used a particular eBay username.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=8QXe4RayAPgzFm5jp) @zixian5 The SDK uses the genesis transactions file to contact some of the original nodes in the validator pool. It then asks those nodes if any new nodes have been added. If the answer is yes, then the original nodes from the validator pool prove that the new nodes were added according to correct rules of consensus, and supplies the contact information for the additional nodes. This is a process called "catchup", and it results in client code having an accurate idea of which validator nodes are currently canonical for the pool.

After this is done, the client code then sends a read or write request to multiple validator nodes. Which nodes it picks is not under client control. This is a security design choice. We assume that one or more of the validator nodes could be malicious (attempt to lie to a client). Therefore the client randomly contacts several of them (enough so that at least one of them is not malicious).

The nodes process the transaction request, and provide a reply. The reply has to be signed by multiple nodes, such that any single node cannot forge a response--only a response backed by genuine consensus is legitimate.

Communication between clients and nodes currently uses ZMQ technology.

Did this answer your question?

@danielhardman Sorry to berate you with questions as you seem to be getting a lot today.  Thanks for your extremely thoughtful and detailed responses!  But just curious on your thoughts about this comment and an ongoing theme of microledgers. "Pairwise DIDs will mostly be written to microledgers, so they impose little or no burden on the global, public ledger." That, as well as the recently updated (last Monday I believe) Evernym updated paper on "What Goes on the Ledger", which also points to microledgers as helping with a lot of this friction on the ledger.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=yFuivKKXJtpNgKkzo) @danielhardman Thanks @danielhardman. When changes are made to the ledger; can the clients listen to it so that they can take appropriate action if required? Tendermint has this feature, I believe.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 00:26:29 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=jHeWcbxwrTm478AE9) @ShivVenkatraman No. However, most of the kinds of data that you might be interested in tracking are not on The Ledger anyway. So I'm not sure whether that really matters. What specific types of information do you want to track?
</p>
<p><strong>ShivVenkatraman</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 00:31:02 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=42604d71-2331-4bbd-8cf1-ac938e069b7d) @danielhardman @danielhardman In "what goes on ledger" (https://www.evernym.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/What-Goes-On-The-Ledger.pdf), there is a reference to storing public claims on the ledger. One scenario was to store the issuer info (with his consent) on the ledger; and so that verifiers can get more info on the issuer. So if the issuer has updated his phone number (for example), the verifiers and provers across different node instances know by querying the ledger instead of making cross-node calls
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 03:53:19 GMT):<br/>
I think you are misunderstanding that doc. The version of it that I am reading at that URL does not mention storing claims on the registry. It does talk about storing schemas (which tell which sorts of claims will be in credentials of that type, when they are finally issued), and credential definitions (which tell who will be signing credentials that use a given schema, and how revocation data will be managed). But claims themselves are never stored on the ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 03:54:33 GMT):<br/>
If someone wants to tell the world their definitive phone number, they don't do it by publishing the number to the ledger. Rather, they publish a DID Doc that tells the world how to talk to their agent at a chosen endpoint. The world can then call that endpoint and interrogate the agent to find out their phone number, mailing address, etc. The endpoint doesn't change, but all the other info about the company can vary in realtime.

Hi, I am trying to work through the docs on how to get started with indy. Currently I am here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/environment/docker/pool/README.md I have started a pool but cannot start indy client using ./client_for_pool_start.sh I get - No such container: indyclient - any ideas?

<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 14:57:19 GMT):<br/>
Hi everyone, I still need someone can clarify this question "the identity owner will not share the actual data to the requester", I know this can be explained if the requester wants the identity owner to prove you are more than 18 years old, but if the requester needs to know your exactly SSN, does Indy still can support not share the actual SSN to the requester but instead will send something else? Kindly advise.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 15:14:48 GMT):<br/>
@lijiachuan - the identity owner could share that they have a credential from the Issuing Authority that they have an SSN, but do not share the SSN itself.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 15:17:56 GMT):<br/>
But if the requester needs to know the SSN (as you say) the identity owner would need to share it to meet the requirements - assuming they want the service offered.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=2YS8tCtXkQb8CB9yo) @swcurran So can I have a node that doesn't have any of these roles? and provide roles to some of my DIDs? e.g. having a network with no steward or trustee
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 15:39:40 GMT):<br/>
Yes.  We think of the nodes kind of like a database.  It's the DIDs that provide the roles for performing network operations.   Unless you are planning on conributing to indy-node, you should try to get a network running and then ignore it.  :-)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=Kug4cy6ZizoaG4wS3) @danielhardman You are right. I somehow had a 2017 version of the doc. It also had a whole paragraph on Public Claims (which I pasted to the sdk thread). The 2018 version of the doc does not refer to Public Claims. Here is the bottom of the 2017 doc: "Goes on Sovrin
􀂌 Decentralised identifiers and associated DDOs with verification keys and endpoints.
􀂌 Schemas and claim definitions
􀂌 Proof of consent for data sharing
􀂌 Public claims
􀂌 Revocation registries
Does not go on Sovrin
􀂞 Private data of any kind (including hashed personal data)
􀂞 Private proof of existence".

@wip-abramson start here instead https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk ... this should allow you to get the pool up and running in a docker container and then you can look through the wrappers to dind you language of choice to investigate further.

In https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/start-nodes.md, it mentions about domain_transactions_genesis file that has initial NYM transactions for trustee, steward etc. How are the entries for verkey and dest (did) generated in that file? Is there a way to control what gets into that file? Also, when new trust_anchors are created explicitly via buildNymRequest, where do the entries get populated? I don't see them in domain_transactions_genesis

If the verkey of the issuer (who had earlier issued claims to a prover) is replaced, should the subsequent (after key replacement) proof verification (by another verifier) of the proof shown by prover fail? It's not in my test case; but I am not sure what is the expected behavior

The Sovrin whitepaper https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sovrin-Protocol-and-Token-White-Paper.pdf refers to observer and validator nodes. Does Indy support such a model? Currently all nodes seem to be validators
</p>
<p><strong>haggs</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 01:04:29 GMT):<br/>
@ShivVenkatraman The node consensus algorithm is very performant and favors diversity, high throughput, and other things as far as my understanding.  From what I can gather some validator nodes may be dual purpose depending on that algorithm and the current state of the node.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=bYGHrGbjd5hNHFSQ3) @ShivVenkatraman Verkey is different than issuance key. Verkey is to verify the connection to the issuer. Issuance key is used to verify credential signatures. Verkey is meant to be pairwise so rotating it only changes the connection to you not to everyone else. If the issuer did indeed rotate the issuance key in the credential definition, then that doesn't necessarily invalidate existing credentials. It just means newer credentials are not using the older key. If the issuer wanted to revoke all issued credentials, they would zero out the revocation registry.

Although Sovrin is just one deployment of Hyperledger Indy, it may still be of interest to the Indy community that, after a year’s worth of work by the  Sovrin Governance Framework Working Group, the Sovrin Foundation has announced the beginning of the public review period for the Sovrin Governance Framework V2 (formerly called the Sovrin Trust Framework). As the “constitution” of the Sovrin Network, this set of documents specifies the purpose, principles, and policies that govern Sovrin as a global public utility for self-sovereign identity. Read the full story on the Sovrin blog: https://sovrin.org/announcing-public-review-of-the-sovrin-governance-framework-v2/

Hi, I'm following the Getting Started guide with the indy-cli into a test network and I didn't understood very well the concept of a Credential Definition and how it's related with a Credential Schema?
</p>
<p><strong>calvingerling</strong> (Sat, 03 Nov 2018 07:02:17 GMT):<br/>
In the guide it's needed to create Credential Definitions to Faber (Transcription) and Acme (Job-Certificate). I'm using the `ledger cred-def` command in the cli it has been a little troublesome with the `primary` and `revocation` arguments, the `primary` have a really specific structure (I've found in `indy-crypto` code the struct of it but there's no documentation about what each thing represents), can someone explain me the purpose and usage of the `primary` argument?

I seem to be able to change the Common Name for a CA without a problem using the `cryptogen` tool. I can validate it with `openssl x509`. But, I can't find *any place* to do the same for the TLS cert. It always uses `tlsca` as the hostname in the CN. Does anyone know to change either the CN for the TLS cert -or- the FQDN so it matches the default CN?

Continuing on with the conversation that was in the meeting: here's a transcript blurb: ```
Should the unpack method then be statically configured to determined the trust context and security updates over time change the static configuration? 
From Kyle Den Hartog to Everyone: (11:57 AM)
 Time check 3 minutes 
From Sam Curren (TelegramSam) to Everyone: (11:57 AM)
 Matthew, not sure what you mean. 
From Matthew Hailstone to Everyone: (11:58 AM)
 Unpack basically determines the security context from what I heard, correct? 
From Stephen Curran to Everyone: (11:59 AM)
 Unpack tells you what the security context is - the attributes of the message. Then you decide if you are OK with that. 
From Me to Everyone: (11:59 AM)
 I think I heard that, I guess my question would be how do you dynamically change the security context you’d like over time? 
From Matthew Hailstone to Everyone: (11:59 AM)
 If that’s the case, then the implementation of unpack needs to determine how safe the message is or based on current cryptography schemes and their current state determine whether the message is trusted (or other context states). 
From Matthew Hailstone to Everyone: (12:01 PM)
 I’m recommending that the determination of the trust context be something that is statically built into the version of the indy-sdk/unpack/pack functions and that updates to the indy-sdk would update how unpack determines the trust context. 
From Me to Everyone: (12:01 PM)
 Matthew, semi-related - Message trust entirely based on crypto and security is good, but seems not like the silver bullet - I think message trust along with reputation of those connecting (and over time) is the combination that solves this issue

If a DID/DID-document referred to/was, say, a purchase order or an invoice, who would the trusted Issuer be?  ...ideally as well as in practice?

Hi, I'm working through section 3.7 Definitions and Terminology in the Provisional Trust Framework. Looking at just the first 7 definitions on page 11, they don't hang/connect together as good as I expect them to. For example, I'm trying to draw a conceptual/logical architecture diagram/data model relating these 7 concepts and it's not that easy.

Are these definitions frozen? Are people interested in feedback/improvements?
Does anyone know of an existing (detailed) conceptual/logical architecture diagram/data model for Sovrin?

I've posted a HIPE that proposes we move away from the current PR-centric approach to HIPEs, where a PR for a HIPE is only merged after it is accepted, to one that is based on merging HIPE PRs more or less immediately, and tracking the status of a HIPE by it's location in a set of repo folders - propsed, final-review, accepted, archived and rejected.

The PR for the HIPE can be found here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/56

The current text of the HIPE can be found here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/31446b154f2ac8eb991b6e1d4725623f7ba587a8/text/new-hipe-process/new-hipe-process.md

Hi All! I'm newbie with Indy and Sovrin so excuse for potentially stupid questions but I would be interested in knowing if there is project to provide a Sovrin mobile wallet app going on anywhere. Functionality that I see this could provide are for instance:
- A service (as in an Android service) that runs on a background and that maintains the user wallet on the device. User interface components can integrate with this service to provide user with information about the wallet or to make changes to the wallet.
- User interface to see the state of the wallet (perhaps some functions around updating the wallet as well, even though those might be provided by separate, case-specific user interface applications)
- Way to backup and restore the contents of a wallet on users explicit approval (to a cloud provider, probably)

is there a limit to the number of steward nodes?
</p>
<p><strong>wangdong</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 09:52:16 GMT):<br/>
I think that the all the service provider can be as a validator node, but from the document I found 'For the General Availability Network, once there is a sufficient number of Stewards, the
Sovrin Trust Framework SHOULD incorporate policies for ensuring System Diversity and
Diffuse Trust that can be enforced algorithmically and dynamically by the Sovrin Open
Source Code operating on all Nodes to determine which Nodes should be operating as
Validator Nodes at any one point in time.`

I don't know if this was mentioned already or not, but it would be really cool to develop an app for the Ledger Nano https://ledger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/additional/publishing_an_app.html
So people could use it to authenticate with it. Though I don't know how exactly it would work and if they'd accept such early stage application

My feedback added to the the following Medium.com article: https://hackernoon.com/the-one-thing-missing-from-erc-721-standard-for-digital-collectibles-on-the-blockchain-9ee26e4a918c
"Once a Non-Fungible Entity (e.g. [Person], [Organization], [Thing], Cryptokitty, Purchase Order, Invoice, Shipping Instructions, Delivery Confirmation, etc.) have been fully realized and encased in concrete plus 100 layers of titanium and digitally signed so that it can never be altered, why can't it be accessed using a trusted service within a smart contract VM?…why can't there be a set of simple standard VM-level interop methods for querying any NFE found anywhere on the planet, selecting an entity or entities from the result set, and then calling on a standard set of accessors to deserialize the properties desired by a smart contract invocation which, in turn, is being called by an off-chain app or another on-chain smart contract?" Is anyone aware of a blockchain/VM project that is already undertaking this approach for direct NFE access from a smart contract?

Hello Everyone, I am setting up the indy-world demo using https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain-Identity/indy-ssivc-tutorial. While I try to run ./manage.sh start, it is giving issues while pulling schema-spy. 
Pulling schema-spy (schema-spy:)...
ERROR: The image for the service you're trying to recreate has been removed. If you continue, volume data could be lost. Consider backing up your data before continuing.

Continue with the new image? [yN]y
Pulling schema-spy (schema-spy:)...
ERROR: pull access denied for schema-spy, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login'
Does anyone have an idea what issue it could be? in the ./manage.sh build, the schema-spy image was built, but when I check docker image ls, I do not see the schema-spy image present. Not sure how it gets deleted. Please let me know if you have any suggestions. Thanks

You can ignore the schema spy piece. It is just used to look at the data schema, and really should be removed from that.  If that's the only issue, you can proceed.

What would be the rational on why Trustees should not add validator nodes and this is reserved to Stewards? Is this more like a separation of concerns? I mean by proxy of creating a steward they can circumvent this...althogh this action would be public of course.  But why was this decided on purpose?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=dpCLxHcEb29rDfF5h) @baconsandwich Can you give some context on your question? As far as I understand it, with the current permissioning model, both Trustees and Stewards could add validator nodes.

   @baconsandwich @drummondreed The trustee role in indy cannot add node credentials to the ledger, and belongs to an individual rather than an organization. However, a trustee can be the employee of an organization that is a steward. There are a few instances of this now.

Great stuff, @pknowles. It just highlights that, as we get the rest of SSI infrastructure into place (no small job), interoperable semantics will become the whole focus. Great to see this happening.

Sorry to bug you guys, but I'm getting conflicting information.  It looks like, to my untrained eye, that revocation currently exists in Indy and as far as I can tell, is completely implemented.  But I've also heard that Indy doesn't have revocation, yet.  Am I missing something?
</p>
<p><strong>aaronr</strong> (Tue, 20 Nov 2018 21:58:31 GMT):<br/>
completely implmeneted = tests exist for current level of functionality and that succeed
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 20 Nov 2018 23:24:00 GMT):<br/>
@aaronr it depends on the layer.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 20 Nov 2018 23:24:30 GMT):<br/>
Revocation is implemented in Indy Node. Within Indy SDK, LibIndy implements it, and the pull request into LibVCX is almost done. I'm not aware of an agent that has revocation implemented yet.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=hBs2a9HGS5oZY2BxY) @mgbailey Isn't this a circular argument? My question was why a Trustee can not add nodes, and you answer that he can not answer because he is a Trustee. My main quesiton is why this separation was made. The Trustee has "higher" privileges than a Steward, so why was it decided that he ca not add nodes himself. My assumption that this has to do with separation of duties to avoid concentrating too much power in one entity. But I would like to know what the "official" reason is.

I mean, I understand what you are saying, but I don't see *why* this has to be this way. Why can't the Trustee not be an organization too? And the Steward can add other Trust Anchors, so this is something that is a concrete action and will be performed by a Human probably.....So I guess there was some Idea behind how these roles were created. And this is still uncreal to me. :confused:

Hello everybody. We have finally removed old client code, which was merged with our plenum & node codebases. For now the only way to connect to ledger and send transactions is Indy SDK (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk). Old getting started guide is deprecated too. You can find new one at https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/getting-started/getting-started.md

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=uuzTNSjHAgsYKWMaG) @aristide Since Indy is a public-permissioned network, you would need permission to join a network. Once observer nodes are completed (lower priority on roadmap for core dev team), then it may be possible depending on if observer nodes are given permissionless or permissioned access to the network. My best guess is that they will be permissioned as well to prevent DDoS attacks on the validator pool of nodes, but until someone writes the code it's just a design.

In an online commerce scenario, if Alice working for Acme Org acting as a Customer sends an electronic Purchase Order (a Sovrin entity) that is received by Bob working for Bobbles Org acting as a Supplier... who are the most likely actors responsible for the Holder, Inspector, Issuer, and Verifier roles? ...feel free to speculate if this is a new(er) use case.

to be clear, the indy software runs the sovrin ledger... but theoretically it could be used to create an independent network... basically trying to understand how to talk \write about it
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 01:55:54 GMT):<br/>
do I say "indy creates a public ledger" or can I write: "since indy is a public ledger" or is it just as well to refer to the code as indy and the ledger\network as sovrin?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 02:05:13 GMT):<br/>
it's fine to refer to the code as indy, and the network+governance as sovrin

thx. one more question:
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 03:00:44 GMT):<br/>
did document for a public DID is stored on or off ledger?
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 03:01:11 GMT):<br/>
assuming it's off... but assuming is rough work
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 03:07:50 GMT):<br/>
globally public DIDs (usually used for issuing credentials) are stored on ledger. private DIDs (usually used for encrypting communications). Here's a link to slides that outline this well. https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UnC_nfOUK40WS5TD_EhyDuFe5cStX-u0Z7wjoae_PqQ/
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 03:30:16 GMT):<br/>
that is a useful document, @kdenhartog 

What I'm trying to distinguish is the DID from the DID Doc\JSON File
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 03:30:24 GMT):<br/>
where does the did doc live?
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 03:30:52 GMT):<br/>
for private, this is with some agent I'm supposing...
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 05:19:53 GMT):<br/>
ok, moving on.. cause it doesn't really matter to me where public DID docs are stored I'm just a nit-picker

<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 05:46:05 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=3Wt8XookBnzKms2Kt) Michael, first, see Figure 1 of https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/ for the current terms the W3C Verifiable Claims Working Group is using for these roles: issuer, holder, verifier, and identifier registry (the final term which is still being debated as its role is broader than just a registry for identifiers).
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 05:54:39 GMT):<br/>
Second, in your scenario, you are introducing the idea that a verifiable credential (a Purchase Order) can itself be a Sovrin Entity. That's a cool concept that I haven't seen modeled much yet. However I don't think it changes the basic roles. Acme Org is the Issuer because the P.O. is from Acme Org, not from Alice. Alice, acting as a Delegate of the Issuer, triggers the issuance of the P.O. as a VC. Since the P.O. is to Bobbles Org, I believe Bobbles.Org is both the Holder and the Verifier. Bob is acting as a Delegate of Bobbles Org just like Alice is acting as a Delegate of Acme.Org.
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 06:00:17 GMT):<br/>
When you map out the agent-to-agent (A2A) flows, they will involve four agents: two enterprise agents (Acme Org and Bobbles Org) and two personal agents (Alice and Bob). Alice's agent has a connection with the Acme Org agent and has been issued a Delegate VC. Bob's agent has a connection with Bobbles Org and has been issued a Delegate VC. Alice uses her Delegate VC to triggers the issuance of the P.O. as a VC sent from the Acme Org agent to the Bobbles Org agent who stores it as the Holder. The Bobbles Org agent then verifies the VC as the Verifier and notifies Bob's agent of the result. 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 06:04:37 GMT):<br/>
@drummondreed - very cool to see you write that out so clearly.  The interplay between delegates and organizations was one of our first conundrums in this space (way back in 2017 - ancient history).  That description is basically where we got as well. Nice!
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 06:22:37 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran Thanks. Yes, I remember it well. I've become a massive fan of delegates (and delegate VCs) as I think they are the ones that do the vast majority of authorizing work and making actual decisions in the A2A world. Very elegant.
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 06:23:11 GMT):<br/>
do pairwise DIDs have any data whatsoever on the public chain? such as a public key?

or.. what I think I'm understanding is that only public parties store data on the ledger that is used to verify and support off-chain relationships with private dids?
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 06:29:10 GMT):<br/>
@infominer33 Your understanding is correct if you are talking about a *Sovrin* A2A network architecture. I say that because other deployments of Hyperledger Indy agents might choose to have a different set of dependencies and services from an Indy ledger network. But with Sovrin Privacy by Design architecture, a private pairwise pseudonymous DID-to-DID connection has no direct dependency on the Sovrin public ledger. Thus, as you say, the main purpose of the Sovrin public ledger is for public DIDs that issuers use for discovery and to sign VCs that need to be publicly verifiable.
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 06:31:56 GMT):<br/>
Note, however, that there are two designed-but-not-yet implemented-and-deployed features of off-ledger  pairwise pseudonymous DID-to-DID connections that *do* use the  Sovrin public ledger. The first one is called dead drops—used to reconnect two agents who happen to lose their connection (e.g., both moved agencies at the same time and could not update each other with new service endpoints). The second one is called Agent Authorization Policies, and that's a security feature of  DKMS that's explained further in the  DKMS Design and Architecture doc:  http://bit.ly/dkmsv3

thank you for sharing the finer points!
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 06:33:49 GMT):<br/>
tbh, it took me quite a few reads of "what goes on the ledger" to finally come to the conclusion that the pairwise did probably doesn't even have a signature or anything on the chain
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 06:34:23 GMT):<br/>
Exactly. We should strive to make that clearer in the next version of the paper.
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 06:35:40 GMT):<br/>
cause the wp is about what goes on the ledger.. but spends a bunch of time about DIDs while not being super explicit about which part if any is on the chain for private

@mwherman2000 The "Issuer" is the actor that creates and issues the data capture request. In this case, Acme.org would appear to be the "Issuer" of the purchase order. (I'll study your diagram in more detail in the morning with fresh senses!)

@pknowles When you look at the aggregation relationships in middle blue Logical Data Model layers (the open diamond shapes), st this level of detail, I think there will/may be different Issuers for each Fact e.g. the Issuer of the next (sequential) PO No. will not be the same as the Issuer of the Customer Address or the Shipping Instructions or the Line Items ...potentially for (sub) Issuers in addition to the Issue of the aggregrated Purchase Order or Purchase Order Bundle NFE.

@pknowles Some of these sub Issuers may be specific departments within Acme Org (e.g. Central Purchasing, Receiving, etc.).  Issuers of the Address NFEs may be the National Post Service or similar government service or a contractor operating on their behalf.  The latter may be Issuers and/or Verifiers?

@changeagent basically, as I understand it. The ledger is used to validate organizations, who then validate user credentials(off-ledger)... and those user credentials can be verified as 'legit' by the ledger. 

So the user, or organizations the user wants to transact with can verify the credential by checking the ledger.

does that answer your question?

and now I have a question:
Its difficult to discern exactly the line between sovrin and indy. 
When describing Indy, it's easier to default to describing sovrin...

I'm just confused, and now re-reading the edx course to figure out how to describe it... as I'm writing about Indy, atm...  but how to do that without mostly talking about it as used in sovrin

@mwherman2000 Schema attributes (Address, etc.) can obviously be aggregated from various sources. In the case of aggregated data capture, the creator and subsequent issuer of the aggregated schema would be the "Issuer". Not sure if that helps or not.

@mwherman2000 - an interesting use case. I'd be interested in participating in a discussion in Basel about it.  Keep me in the loop.

One way we've been thinking about the design of Credentials is determining how the holder of the Verifiable Credential would have to use it - what would they need to prove and to whom?  In thinking about it that way, are all of the Facts in the use case VCs? Perhaps, but I'm not certain at the level I've gone through it. Something to consider.

On the Issuer/Holder question - I think that in general, the role of Alice and Bob are indeed as delegates of Acme and Bobbles, respectively, and so Acme/Bobbles are the likely Issuers/Holders of the VCs. The delegate relationship is (current implementation at least) still informally defined but as these more complex use cases get implemented, it will crystalize. It will be extremely common.

thx @swcurran I have a question also about the edX course... does it teach indy generally as deployed by sovrin?

trying to clarify as Drummond pointed out that the code could be used differently than as in sovrin
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 11:58:37 GMT):<br/>
based on the "what goes on the blockchain" section of edx, it seems to be taught as implemented in sovrin.. but it would be nice to know if there are any differences I should look out for
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 11:59:30 GMT):<br/>
because I'm working on some educational material also, and I don't want to produce conflicting information
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 12:23:23 GMT):<br/>
I focused on what was implemented in Indy at the time of writing. Since Sovrin is runs Indy software, it's much the same, but you do have to be carefully in taking about what is there now and what is intended.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=jnteRP9Gcy8LHhyov) @infominer33 Thanks! Sort of... After further research, my understanding is that DIDs and the identity records associated with them can either be published to the chain, or, as in Sovrin, they can be used to set up an encrypted communication channel between two parties (the pseudonymous option, where you get the benefit of public-private key cryptography but it does not use the ledger).

I'm working on a fairly detailed architecture model of the Getting Started user scenario ...from a which a series of views (simple diagrams) can created using drag&drop.  Here's what I call an "all-in" construction view from page 2 (only) of the Getting Started document (What We'll Cover and "About Alice")...

@kdenhartog In your recent youtube video (https://youtu.be/llwfb5Ut5sg?t=386), you mention DIDs are based on RFC2141. My reading of RFC2141 indicates that the scheme portion of a URN needs to be "urn:" ...not anything else (e.g. "did:").  Should your slide reference some other, more general, specification that permits alternative scheme identifiers?   Reference: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt

@kdenhartog Q3. Follow-up re: your draft Global Forum presentation.  In your presentation of the "3-axis" model, I think you're missing a 4th axis: Time ...because the organizational role I'm associated with at any given instant is like to change over time.  I don't always have the same role (aka relationship) with my university/school, my back, whoever is my current employer, etc.  Time is an important element.  More importantly, does the Time dimension affect the requirements for the Microledger?  Here's a visual example of all of Alice's roles changing over time...

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=Cpka9Tg7ciMieSa4h) @mwherman2000 This has been a bit of a hot topic in the past - e.g. several years ago.  It's mostly settled now AFAIK.  The word "Claim" was used in previous works and then in the name of the W3C Working Group (names of which are not easy to change). However, the term Credential is now considered to mean a group of Claims.  So a Verifiable Credential is issued to a Holder and that Verifiable Credential contains one or more Verifiable Claims. The Holder can then prove (caveat here) the individual Claims within the Credential to a Verifier.

The caveat is that some Verifiable Credential systems handle proofs only of the Credential, not of the Claims within a Credential. That approach means that selective disclosure, ZKPs and Proofs referencing Claims from multiple Credentials are not supported.  Indy (and hence Sovrin) support all of those capabilities.

@danielhardman I'm watching <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km4IoUdb3Lc> - the part where you're discussing crypto vs. identity wallets and was wondering...
What is a modern name for an (Indy-Sovin) place/app that acts as a repository for (UBL) business documents?  
First, the documents need to be properly grouped/organized in to subledgers (subsidiary ledgers of a general ledger …ref: https://www.cliffsnotes.com/study-guides/accounting/accounting-principles-i/subsidiary-ledgers-and-special-journals/subsidiary-ledgers).
If crypto has crypto currency wallets, and digital identities have identity wallets, what do we call this thing that stores general ledgers, subledgers, accounts, and business documents ...in addition to identities and crypto assets?   …a portfolio, a register, a journal, a quickbooks (oops, that one is already taken), …?
I kind of like Business Register  ...Organization Business Register and Personal Business Register ...the OBR and the PBR. Your thoughts?

I could create DID and create a new schema with command 'ledger schema'. But what exactly is the command 'ledger cred-def'? what is the 'schema-id' and 'primary' in the command 'ledger cred-def schema_id=<schema_id-value> signature_type=<signature_type-value> [tag=<tag>] primary=<primary-value>'?

Hello all. I've been working in the blockchain space for a while now, and in particular I've had a keen interest in identity. I've heard a lot about this project but I'm only just now finding time to start digging into it. I'm wondering if there is any high level documentation & process flows to help get me up to speed with some of the terminology before I dig into deploying/contributing. Would Sovrin be the right place to look?

I have been exploring the idea of writing a did:peer method spec. This would document how to manage a relationship and its associated DIDs and keys purely through peer-to-peer communication. It would not be specific to Indy (or, indeed, to any particular blockchain), though it would be implemented using Indy messaging concepts because A2A addresses many of the mechanisms it needs. Anybody want to collaborate?

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 05 Dec 2018 09:47:18 GMT):<br/>
@shyam 40 This is an error that occurs when the wallet_handle that's being passed isn't able to be found. Typically, this occurs because you haven't created/opened a wallet yet which returns the wallet_handle.

Is there an updated version of the faber college sample that works with the new cli? I'm also curious as to exactly what they .indy files are doing in these samples. Are they being processed as custom transactions?
As an aside to that question, how exactly are the relationships between entities managed. I read the document explaining the various relationships and I understood that, but within indy itself, is each new pairwise relationship represented by a new DID(issued by the trusted org), or is it possible to have a single DID with multiple attestations to the credibility of the holder? For example on a single DID I may have multiple TRUST_ANCHORS signatures.

I've asked this multiple times before on the indy-sdk channel but have had no response: Who is responsible for the Hyperledger Indy Github repo? The current .NET wrapper's README.md points to the Hyperledger repo for the .NET docs but it's not working because the repo needs to be configured with "Github Pages" with the source as the Master branch.  I'd like to get this sorted out, otherwise we'll have to find another source for hosting the docs since they're inaccessible.  See here for details on the change that needs to be made: https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 01:36:22 GMT):<br/>
@srottem Sorry for the frustration. Part of what may be causing issues is that the Hyperledger help desk has to make these sort of changes. Just to be sure, @nage does that seem accurate to you? With the recent work on a read the docs site for Indy by @mboyd it might be the case that github-pages isn't the ideal place for this documentation anymore anyways. Thoughts?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=7Ne6xPjmYrwcm7JNc) @nage It works great and it's a lot more clean than the previous versions, but it does seem to be limited in it's capabilities, specifically with regards to it's ability to follow the Alice & faber college getting started sample. can't seem to load any of the .indy files and what not
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 19:53:20 GMT):<br/>
The new sdk based cli made the deliberate choice to focus on node transactions and interacting with the ledger over the credentials protocol.  It is better to use the sdk api directly in a programming language for most of that work.  Specifically the python examples in iPython or similar systems is more flexible and will get to a working POC without requiring a rewrite like deploying on the old CLI might have

Which actors in the Indy terminology can be issuers of verifiable claims? For instance, a trust anchor can create identities, presumably they can also issue claims. May someone with one of those newly created identities who is *not* a trust anchor also be able to issue verifiable claims?

Question about the trust model with Indy/Sovrin: 
Given that the trust placed by service providers / identity consumers on given claims, really depends on the level of trust the service provider have for the claim 'issuer', How does the SSI concept or Indy solve the decentralized trust model. It seems the services provides still have to be able to trust the identity providers somehow, which maybe done offline and outside of the Indy network.. perhaps through traditional PKI or WebofTrust (reputation based) approaches. Does Indy/Sovrin offer any novel solution in how different entities can trust each others public keys, or is this requirement outside of the Indy ecosystem. I am aware of the trust framework that Sovrin has, but I think that is also a form of weboftrust/pki no?

<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Sun, 09 Dec 2018 05:27:43 GMT):<br/>
@the_identity_guy Fantastic question. Short answer: while Indy doesn't address this directly, Sovrin does. The Sovrin Governance Framework Working Group has been active at the Sovrin Foundation for over two years and is just about done with the  Sovrin Governance Framework V2. It's been in  public review since Nov 1 and should be approved by the Sovrin Board of Trustees by the end of the year. You can see all the main documents at  https://sovrin.org/governance-framework/
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Sun, 09 Dec 2018 05:45:56 GMT):<br/>
The SGF V2 in turn lays the groundwork for what we call the  Sovrin Web of Trust Model. This is a globally scalable formal web of trust model based on DIDS and verifiable credentials. It defines four main classes of issuers in terms of escalating strength-of-trust: Peer, Trust Anchor, Trust Hub, Governance Authority. All the roles are optional, i.e., any trust community can assemble the roles it needs to serve its purposes. For any Proof received by a Verifier, the Verifier can walk the trust chain up as far as that particular chain goes, i.e., if the Proof is from a Peer, does the Peer have a Proof from a Trust Anchor? Does the Trust Anchor have a Proof from a Trust Hub? Does the Trust Hub have a Proof from a Governance Authority? Governance Authorities publish what we call domain-specific governance frameworks, so they are the real backbones of trust, and under this model there can be tens of thousands of them and they can cross-certify to form a true global web of trust.
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Sun, 09 Dec 2018 05:47:33 GMT):<br/>
Once the Sovrin Governance Framework V2 is passed, the next major job of the SGFWG is to formalize the  Sovrin Web of Trust Governance Framework. We welcome anyone who wants to join us in this work; the Sovrin Foundation is an open governance community just like  Hyperledger is an open source community. See the https://sovrin.org/governance-framework/ page for details of how to engage.

@drummondreed This is regarding the Economic Policies of Sovrin Framework. Some countries like India, China, Russia to name a few, have banned cyrpto currencies. If Sovrin comes with it's own cyrptocurrency, then it can't be used in such countries that contribute to major population. Any thoughts on this?

@skaree ; this is gonna be a long explanation. Like explaining all simple things , its difficult to explain but i try my best. In DID as you know you can have two paths - Annonymity ( keeping the identity of the user annonymous - not known to anyone, more for one time use or pseudonymous - using zero knowledge proof for more than one time use) to verinimity ( able to verify the identity of the user using Trust Anchor - organizations issuing identity). So; in short, they are blinded of which Pseudonym is a part( you are not able to see the details of the user) and verifiable - read verinym ( you can verify the details fo the users). Do let me know if that helps .

<p><strong>DuckLover</strong> (Wed, 12 Dec 2018 21:34:39 GMT):<br/>
everything else would make any sense or am i wrong? How do the other party check for the public key if the DID is not on the sovrin ledger?
</p>
<p><strong>vikpande</strong> (Wed, 12 Dec 2018 21:37:14 GMT):<br/>
so, if you want someone to check for your public key through verifiable credential then you keep it on ledger; else you keep it off ledger ( a choice you make based on your needs/use case)
</p>
<p><strong>DuckLover</strong> (Wed, 12 Dec 2018 21:38:30 GMT):<br/>
isnt the public key used to enable a secure communication? so in nearly every case the other party should check for it?
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Wed, 12 Dec 2018 21:41:00 GMT):<br/>
Public meaning that the DID is an identifier for an entity that wants to issue credentials that are able to be verified against the ledger. Typically corporations, NGOs, governments, etc. Individuals will typically not be issuing credentials to others, so no need of a (possibly permanent) DID on a ledger for them. In fact, such a DID would allow cross correlation, which is undesirable for individuals.
</p>
<p><strong>DuckLover</strong> (Wed, 12 Dec 2018 21:42:04 GMT):<br/>
Also refering to https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/How-Sovrin-Works.pdf the public Key of both parties ist stored on the ledger, even Alice Key should be off-ledger because its is created for a direct communication between every party
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Wed, 12 Dec 2018 21:42:23 GMT):<br/>
or if an individual does need such a DID, it would be used only for issuing credentials. Other private DIDs would be used for all other interactions

No. When you connect to the corp, you will generate a new DID that you will share with the corp, and them only.  They will keep track of it internally.

There is no need for individuals to leave any trace on the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>DuckLover</strong> (Wed, 12 Dec 2018 21:50:48 GMT):<br/>
So is this answer https://forum.sovrin.org/t/public-facing-dids-vs-private-pairwise-dids/243/5 not correct, because this DID is only stored local on my device and at the corp?
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Wed, 12 Dec 2018 21:51:43 GMT):<br/>
This DID generation is hidden from the individual by the software. It puts the DID and its private key in the individual's local wallet, and sends the DID and public verkey to the corp. It is then pulled from the local wallet when needed for comms with the corp.

The people in this thread are all authoritative, but Andy's comment is very outdated. No longer do we write all DIDs to the ledger. Most are not.

@DuckLover @vikpande et al: I'm at the Hyperledger Global Forum in Basel and just caught up with this thread. The Sovrin Glossary, which originally was at the start of the  Sovrin Provisional Trust Framework, is now a standalone document that is MUCH more comprehensive that the first one. We're going to maintain it as a Google doc so that every term is independently linkable. Here's the link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gfIz5TT0cNp2kxGMLFXr19x1uoZsruUe_0glHst2fZ8/edit?usp=sharing
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 06:47:48 GMT):<br/>
It's one of the documents that is slated to be approved by the  Sovrin Board of Trustees at their year-end meeting on Dec 18th. You can see the full set of docs at  https://sovrin.org/governance-framework/

just a thought as we just watched a video demo (the IBM loan demo) at the Hyperledger Global Forum workshop, in the demos, the convenience aspect is often put forth (ie: look at how easy it is to fill forms with valid data!), but the empowering aspect is not showcased or really not shown at all (ie: you can't refuse to share some of your information)
</p>

Hello guys, i often read that Sovrin is a ledger and sometimes that it is a blockchain. I know that Blockchains are a subset of ledgers but is Sovrin explicit a blockchain or do people start to use it synonymous?
</p>
<p><strong>DuckLover</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 18:45:51 GMT):<br/>
Second question: I read that private Keys never leave the local wallet. How do you communicate with an corp. where you already created pairwise DID? Just creating a new pair of DID and proof trust all over again via transmitting Credentials?
</p>
<p><strong>TammyPlatero</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 19:56:36 GMT):<br/>
Is there a way to see the/a DID schema in the indy-sdk? I can see the generated DID from a wallet and json (a string) but is there a schema of some kind?

@TammyPlatero what are you referring to when you say "DID schema"? The term schema is kind of overloaded
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Sat, 15 Dec 2018 01:04:35 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=hn9hD6L2PRfmXheNL) @DuckLover Pairwise connections allow you to continue communication as long as both parties want to. The secret keys never leaving the wallet means that the Indy SDK takes as a parameter a wallet handle for any operations requiring the secret key, pulling it up and using it but then properly wiping memory after use and making sure the secret key isn't used in inappropriate ways.

</p>
<p><strong>sairak</strong> (Sat, 15 Dec 2018 08:28:15 GMT):<br/>
also in order to get DID, Alice has to provide her personal details to the ledger...in that case ,how we can ensure security and privacy to data?
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Sat, 15 Dec 2018 08:37:05 GMT):<br/>
It’s a very broad question but here’s an answer: DPKI is an architectural philosophy about the advantages of decentralized PKI. The term was created at the first Rebooting Web of Trust workshop in San Francisco about 4 years ago. Here’s a link to the paper: https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust/blob/master/draft-documents/Decentralized-Public-Key-Infrastructure-CURRENT.md [ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=nFeZ5ByqJBSQqS6Sh)
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Sat, 15 Dec 2018 08:40:21 GMT):<br/>
DPKI is not a spec about how to actually implement decentralized PKI. So the next step was to start to create the specs to actually implement it. The first one was DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers). https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Sat, 15 Dec 2018 08:42:37 GMT):<br/>
I also recommend the DID Primer for an easy overview of DIDs: https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-primer/
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Sat, 15 Dec 2018 08:46:22 GMT):<br/>
Now, once you have DIDs, the biggest remaining problem is now to do the decentralized key management that you need for decentralized identifiers. Like with DIDs, it demands an open standard spec that any digital wallet vendor can implement. That spec came to be called DKMS (Decentralized Key Management System). The first step towards creating that spec was a year-long project that Evernym carried out under a research contract from the U.S. Dept of Homeland Security. The resulting design and architecture was published last March in the Hyperledger Indy repo: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/dkms/DKMS%20Design%20and%20Architecture%20V3.md
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Sat, 15 Dec 2018 08:47:12 GMT):<br/>
The next step is to formally submit DKMS to a standards body (OASIS is the leading choice). DM me if you’re interested in being part of that.

@mtkf and I just had our own mini-summit this morning here at the Basel airport and he easily convinced me that DIRL is not the right concept because it is refers to a Resource Location ...not appropriate in a decentralized world ...but we were easily able to arrive a different (and,I think better sounding) concept: a DRI ...Decentralized Resource Identifier.  The scheme remains the same (aka "did") but the string things we now call DRIs and they resolve to DID Documents.  Your thoughts?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=FmjTyCiC2b7priJWP) I disagree—not because @mtfk does not have a point, but because there's a different way to look at it. A DID is *by definition* decentralized. But a DIRL (see note below RE naming) actually DOES define the location of a resource. Using a simplified pseudocode: DIRL = DID + ServiceID + ResourceID (the actual syntax is did:method:specificid;serviceid/path?query#frag where every component except did:method:specificid is optional). So what happens is that while the DID is decentralized (by design), the ServiceID component maps the DIRL to a specific service endpoint URL—which *is* a resource locator—and then adds the optional path?query#fragment components which at that point *are* also resource locators.
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Sun, 16 Dec 2018 12:42:46 GMT):<br/>
Net net: what I like about the term "DIRL" is that it's a simple, catchy term for the combination of a DID that is a true decentralized identifier and a URL that is a true uniform resource locator.
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Sun, 16 Dec 2018 12:43:39 GMT):<br/>
Which finally brings me to my point that DID + URL seems like it would more logically combine into "DURL" (Decentralized URL).
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Sun, 16 Dec 2018 12:44:54 GMT):<br/>
As someone who is constantly having to refer to "the way you can turn a DID into a URL" (which currently in the spec is called a "DID reference"), I really like the idea of a simple, catchy acronym for it: DURL.
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Sun, 16 Dec 2018 12:45:51 GMT):<br/>
Major kudos to @mwherman2000 for the light bulb for that term.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 16 Dec 2018 15:02:19 GMT):<br/>
I agree @drummondreed - we don't need another standard - the DID standard covers it.  dURL might be useful to mean "the concrete URL formed by resolving the DID and applying the DID path fragment to the DID endpoint". If nothing else, it's a reminder that the capability is there.

FYI - an example of the use of this is in the Message Type indy-hipe - notably in this section (but you might want to read the whole HIPE for context) - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0021-message-types#service-selection-by-id
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Sun, 16 Dec 2018 15:06:13 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran Completely agreed that it's not anything new in terms of functionality—just an catchy new name for the functionality that was already there. I personally believe this capability to root conventional URLs on DIDs in order to make them domain-independent and persistent for very long periods will become very popular for certain types of resource references.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=doZFCeKSnpTyum2xy) @drummondreed The problem which we are trying to address with "renaming" stuff is to figure out how we can solve problem with DID as a unit of control. Decentralize identifier is something which should serve in any use case is very generic and fits very well in multiple cases (for example by simply changing main context of DID Doc). The problem is that in the current implementation/spec is tied to the public key. If we would like to use DID for something else then unit of control like schema (unit of language) we entering very dangers space as we are mixing control with language.  We had multiple discussions during HL Global Forum about that problem end even that I am not fully understand all consequences yet I kind of got the point. I think is very important to distinguishes between DID as a unit of control from the rest use cases where not necessary we want to tied to someone key. Language (schema + overlays) are good example were nobody should have control over that what we can or can't speak about. But still we would like to use DID as a generic decentralize identifier to resolve content behind it.  Does that have any sens? 
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Sun, 16 Dec 2018 22:02:16 GMT):<br/>
To avoid confusion with naming I started experimenting with the schema for the URN like:
```
did-schema:sov:1231415124151
did-overlay:sov:13215512312
did-schema-element:sov:5814108410924
```` 
But I think everyone would agree that this is not the way to go. Personally I like the concept of reusing main @context in DID document to tell resolver what type of the content it is. Similar to the idea with MIME Type in the document resolved via HTTP/S
</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Sun, 16 Dec 2018 22:06:02 GMT):<br/>
So as soon as the I will try to resolve `did:sov:8291239123` I check the @context of the document to figure out with what I have to deal and for example it could be:
```
  @context: ["https://domain.com/language/v1"]
  @context: ["https://domain.com/control/v1"]
  @context: ["https://domain.com/..../v1"]
```
I can't remember what other type of units we were talking about during the conf but those two are the most needed right now control is relation between did and public key, where language is did and data schema/language - something which describe how to talk not who controls it. 

</p>
<p><strong>mtfk</strong> (Sun, 16 Dec 2018 22:10:08 GMT):<br/>
Maybe @nage could comment on that as he had very nice arguments about whole topic. As well @nage if you could remind me what other "units" you mentioned about, for sure unit of control and unit of language that stuck in my head but I know that  there was more. Would help to look on that problem from a bigger perspective.

Hi everyone, I have a question regarding `plugins`. As far as I've seen in `indy-plenum` documentation there is a possibility to extend the set of ledgers and transactions with the help of plugins. I have 2 questions: 1) Does the mechanism described for `indy-plenum` works for `indy-node`. Is there any differences in implementation of plugins? 2) If the plugin is used to add some additional transaction, how I can send such a transaction from `indy-sdk`? Is there a way to write plugin for `indy-sdk` or the only way would be to fork and expand the functionality in the code? Any replies or hints would be highly appreciated

There's the need for an "identifier spec" ...the string thing, and 2. logically related but separate is the "protocol spec" for universally interacting with DID Documents ... attributes, schema, keys, etc. etc. Continuing to overload these onto one idea will be forever confuding to people new to Indy (I was trying to type confusing but like the new word better 🙂).

There's the need for an "identifier spec" ...the string thing, and 2. logically related but separate is the "protocol spec" for universally interacting with decentralized resources (DID Documents being one physical manifestation of a DR) ... attributes, schema, keys, etc. etc. Continuing to overload these onto one idea will be forever confuding to people new to Indy (I was trying to type confusing but like the new word better 🙂).

<p><strong>mwherman2000</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 18:48:58 GMT):<br/>
Secondarily, I'm proposing DRI (decentralized resource identifier) and did: as the name and protocol, respectively, for the string identifier, and...
</p>
<p><strong>mwherman2000</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 18:52:59 GMT):<br/>
...and, (perhaps) DRAP (decentralized resource access protocol) and drap: (or didp:) as the name and protocol for interacting with DID Documents ...or something like that

Guys, sorry, I've been tied up in  Madrid and have fallen behind on this thread. One thing I can easily clarify, since it's straight out of the spec: *DID* always refers to the *decentralized identifier*, period. If you want to talk about the JSON-LD document that the DID resolution process returns, that's called the  *DID document*. The DID document contains a copy of the DID itself, but the *DID document is not the DID* and the *DID is not the DID document*.

Now, the whole question that was raised in the last conversations in Basel about using DIDs to address OTHER types of objects on a ledger besides a DID document is *hugely important*. Excellent discussions so far. I'm cooking on it but have to prepare for my final meetings in Madrid now. I have a 9 hour flight from Madrid to Miami tomorrow so I plan to do a writeup on it then.

In addition, your important clarification suggests the spec perhaps needs to call out the concept of a DID Entity ...the concept that aggregates the DID and the DID Document ...the latter being a serialization of a DID Entity.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=S9sngboGi9Q5HECK2) @brentzundel @brentzundel - a nit about this.  There is a DID Spec, at the link Drumond mentioned above. It's a spec that has been defined through considerable effort, discussion and thought.  However, it is not a *finalized *spec, it will undoubtably evolve somewhat, and most importantly, it has not yet been accepted by any Standards body.

My point in adding this is that any discussion about DIDs needs to start from the spec as it stands and participants should be well versed in the current spec.

RE: Link to current draft DID specification.  I scrolled back quite a ways (e.g. a couple days) and couldn't find it.  I don't want to be working from an "old one".  What is the current/best URL to the draft DID specification?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 18 Dec 2018 17:50:04 GMT):<br/>
@mwherman2000 - it's an interesting question.  I agree with you that if a newcomer to a situation has difficulty, that needs to be addressed.  It's not the newcomers fault - whether it is software or specs.  That said, the first step is making sure that all of the information available resolves the issue.  As a newcomer, the starting point should have been the spec and if it wasn't, that's the first thing that needs to be fixed within the community.  If you still have confudsion after that, then yes, fixing the spec is the right place, and as John said, that conversation needs to happen in that context - W3C Community Group.

@kdenhartog I think this diagram might have the same faults as the DID draft specification.  DIDs are just character strings (confirmed by @drummondreed).  Hence, I don't think they can have "types".  I think what is depicted are actually DID Entities ...not DIDs.  Scan the first 5 issues here: https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-spec/issues (issues 115-119) ...119 refers to this diagram...

@mwherman2000 I think your "logical architecture" is good. One nit: you say "the DID is never written to the ledger" but some DID methods will do just that. In the did:sov: method, the DID is written to the  Sovrin ledger using a NYM transaction. The properties of the associated DID document are written using ATTRIB transactions. You can't currently write a  DID document directly to the Sovrin ledger, but that feature is on the roadmap (according to a recent post by @danielhardman). For details see https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/requests.md.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 19 Dec 2018 16:35:42 GMT):<br/>
@DuckLover - the IBM demo was based on the BC Gov VON work.  In that demo, the Credentials (Permits and Licences) were issued by a series of Gov't Services, and the information entered in the form was from the Organization wanting the Permit as an application.  The IBM folks adopted the code and made it work for the Alice/Faber/Acme example, but the flow (as you note) is a bit odd.  Bottom line - it was just a demo and should be thought of as that.

@infominer33 - the production instance of BC Gov's OrgBook and related Issuer/Verifier Agents are using the Sovrin Live (Main?) Net as it's root of trust for DIDs, Schema and Cred Defs.  The non-production instances of the applications/agents are using the BCovrin (http://138.197.138.255) ledger to anchor DIDs, etc.  Ontario Gov is doing the same for it's production and test instances (using Sovrin and BCovrin respectively).

@DuckLover - the VON stuff in BC Gov may work for you, but I'd need a bit more context to know for sure.  It certainly is super easy to set up Issuer/Verifiers with VON, but it is intended is an SSI bootstrapping mechanism for creating a supply of Credential issuers - but not for individuals.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=gz9uMfFg7MhAo2HAd) @knagware9 Correct me when im wrong. 1) You need a client(+Agent) that interacts with the sovrin ledger. For this the client need the genesis record of sovrin that defines the first pool nodes of sovrin. Storage can be done locally on your Client (Mobile Phone, Laptop...), Agent or somewhere else but the clinet/agent have to be able to deliver them to you.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=takPXnoQMqyoj8JF9) @DuckLover This is less a techical question as a Business/Legal question and that's where the Sovrin Governance Framework comes into play.  Technically, it's easy for a Trust Anchor to execute a transaction to create another Trust Anchor. However, getting a TA to do that for requires "proving" in the social sense who you are and what you are planning to do.  This will become solidified over time based on the Sovrin Gov Framework. Right now I believe (at least in my direct experience) on direct interactions with a Trust Anchor.

Hi all :-) . I have this use case : the user get a "earning credential" with its salary from its employer. He provide to the bank, a proof including this data (earning). The bank want to know when the user earning has changed. What is the best way to update the proof for the bank ? Is it possible ? Can the issuer update a credential ? Does the bank need to request regularly a new proof ? ..... Thanks for you solution or idea :-) 
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 11:42:52 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=SBHW9mns3QHJfmxMp) @xnopre So, in answering your question I will quote from a very interesting paper that the German Blockchain Association published 23 October 2018 which I am just making my way through today ... https://jolocom.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Self-sovereign-Identity-_-Blockchain-Bundesverband-2018.pdf ... so far I would recommend it as a great overview of SSI.

``` It is important to say that the exchange of claims happens in a peer-to-peer manner and the Holder is always one of the peers to the interaction. No information is exchanged outside the Holder’s control, a principle that is ensured by storing the Claims under the Holder’s control and requiring cryptographic signatures for each interaction, based on keys only the Holder can access and control.```

So there are a few different aspects to your questions I will address individually.

If the bank wants to know if the earnings have changed .. they must ask the holder of the credential (employee/customer) via a proof request. As per the paragraph quoted above, this is a fundamental design intent of an SSI system. The holder MUST be involved. 

Now, this could be perhaps automated, perhaps when the employee/bank customer agreed to receive a loan from the bank they also consented to answering earnings update requests from the bank every X period of time. This request may be manually handled by the employee/bank customer or perhaps the tell their persistent agent to automatically respond to these proof requests from the bank. This is a business/design decision.

Can the issuer (employer) update a credential. Technically they can not "update" a credential. What they can do is issue a new credential and revoke the previous one. Credentials could also include expiry dates that would offer verifiers a way to ask for "current" credentials. As well, credentials likely will have an issuance date (I think that is a good idea in general) so verifiers can request that claim in a proof request to see how "fresh" the claim is.

Now, all that being said I can promote/test the waters on an upcoming feature of the coming Hyperledger Indy Catalyst's Credential Registry component (aka OrgBook https://orgbook.gov.bc.ca is an example) ... This feature will allow verifiers to subscribe (via a webhook) to an organization page or a credential page so they can be notified of changes such as a legal name change, the issuance of a new permit, the change in legal status of an organization, etc. Now this is only possible when it is ok to have a multi-subject holder (subjects in this case being legal entities). Since we are using public open data that is ok .. we would NOT, at least in our jurisdiction, see this as a pattern for personal data.

The use cases for Hyperledger Indy Catalyst's Credential Registry component are for these kinds of public collections of accreditations. For example, OrgBook BC provides a pillar of trust around legal entities in British Columbia, we hope other jurisdictions might adopt the OrgBook model. However there are many more we think - College of Physicians and Surgeons, Engineering Associations, Law Societies, Universities and Colleges, Government Ministries/Departments, membership organizations (Hyperledger, Sovrin, Industry Associations, etc) and more I am sure. All these have the pattern of having public statements of accreditation of their members.

A very long response .. hope that was helpful.

<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 20:44:00 GMT):<br/>
I've noticed that the indy client executable changed from `indy' to `indy-cli` and that some commands also do not correspond. For instance, command for creating a wallet is described in tutorial as `new wallet Alice` but this does not exist. It appears to be `wallet create <wallet-name> key=<key>`
</p>
<p><strong>joaquimpedrooliveira</strong> (Fri, 21 Dec 2018 20:44:24 GMT):<br/>
Can someone confirm that these docs are really outdated? Am I missing something here?

That answer by @jljordan_bcgov is fantastic. It makes me think we should move more of these discussions into the forums where they are persisted and Google searchable.

i am new to this and currently having local pool of hyperledger indy nodes. this connect to a node app using indy sdk. i have been able to create dids and add them to ledger using sdk. but when i use indy-cli to get those added nyms it says no did found. why can't i get the nyms using indy-cli which i added using indy sdk?

>The performance of the different instances is closely monitored, in order to check that the master instance provides adequate performance.

>Our evaluation shows that RBFT achieves similar performance as the most robust protocols when there is no failure and that, under faults, its maximum performance degradation is about 3%, whereas it is at least equal to 78% for existing protocols.

thanks for your reply. Im not sure thats answers my question but i will definitly check out the plenum paper more. My question was more about the security aspects. In Bitcoin a block contains the hash of the previous block so that if you want to replace a block of data you need to change all the data that follows. I try to understand how Sovrin solves that security problem. But i guess i will try to dig deeper in the plenum papers
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Tue, 25 Dec 2018 12:14:07 GMT):<br/>
thx for the clarification, lemme see what else I can dig up
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Tue, 25 Dec 2018 12:19:09 GMT):<br/>
@DuckLover the Sovrin White Paper says:

1. Each transaction in the blockchain is digitally signed by the originator.
2. Each transaction—singly or in blocks—is chained to the prior via a
digital hash.5
3. Validated transactions are replicated across all machines using a
consensus algorithm

<p><strong>DuckLover</strong> (Tue, 25 Dec 2018 12:20:47 GMT):<br/>
yeah i think thats correct for blockchains but sovrin uses a ledger as i know
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=wgHCiypS9anSKvPAN) @infominer33 i took a quick look in the paper and its mostly deal with performance and malicious nodes that want to change the current data and not data that was written in the past. I will try to look around more about that
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Tue, 25 Dec 2018 12:27:14 GMT):<br/>
I could be reading this wrong, but it appears that each transaction is hashed to the previous transaction?

</p>
<p><strong>DuckLover</strong> (Tue, 25 Dec 2018 12:34:48 GMT):<br/>
well it really look like they are using hash values... Not sure how to understand it with my previous information that it doesnt use chained blocks.
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Tue, 25 Dec 2018 12:49:50 GMT):<br/>
yeah, but I think it's just one transaction after the other, not stored up in blocks before confirmation
</p>
<p><strong>infominer33</strong> (Tue, 25 Dec 2018 12:50:41 GMT):<br/>
hashed to previous transaction(s?) already chained... but not in blocks... because this ledger isn't fast moving like bitcoin

It is possible to change the private key for a DID. Why is it possible?  Are there no concerns that a second DID could be created with the same new Keypair?
</p>
<p><strong>DuckLover</strong> (Fri, 28 Dec 2018 16:01:50 GMT):<br/>
or that severals DID can be controlled by one keypair? like one password for all accounts today?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=rE3kK7bKGQZDofeZS) @DuckLover Answers - yes, it's possible (and expected) to change the private key for a DID - key rotation - and you must have sign the request with the current private key for the DID.  A second DID cannot be created with the same key pair - at most, the DID can be updated because the request is signed by the private key of the DID. However, one of the tenents of these systems is that you don't let others know your private key or (if you keep it) the seed used to create the keypair. That's the only way a second person could update the DID.

Yes, in theory several DIDs could be controlled by one keypair, but you would have to go out of the way to do it. When you create a DID in Indy, the DID string is based on the initial public key of the pair. So to have two keys with one keypair, you would have to create each DID and then rotate the keys to match.  Not sure why you would want to do that, but sure, fill your boots.  Since the public keys would be the same, people would know they had the same private key.  So possible but dumb (same as one password) and inconvenient (different from one password).

Subject: Draft DID spec: DID ARM (Architecture Reference Model) diagram version 0.11

Daniel and list,

I’ve updated the DID ARM (Architecture Reference Model) diagram to version 0.11.  I believe if we can get an agreeable “picture” of what we’re talking about, the correct words will come a lot easier …at least, that’s my experience in the past.
The ARM is posted here: 
https://hyperonomy.com/2018/12/21/decentralized-identifiers-dids-architecture-reference-model-arm/. 
Scroll down the page to the heading Version 0.11 – December 30, 2018 and start reading from there.  If you need/want more background, start reading from the top.  Here’s a copy of what I’ve written there (minus the ARM diagram)…

Version 0.11 – December 30, 2018
The updates in version 0.11 of the Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) ARM (architecture reference model) are limited to the Business Architecture Layer; more specifically, clarifying to roles and relationships between:
        -	Actors (Persons and Organizations), and
        -	Things (Pets, Cars, Houses, Business Documents, Products, Assemblies and Parts).

The role of Actor in the model is a key learning that came out of the Basel workshop.
I’ve taken the idea a step further to find a proper “place and set of relationships” for the Sovrin concept of “Things”.  I believe I’ve (successfully?) done that but am looking for feedback/consensus about these ideas.  They are presented visually in the diagram below.
The new Business Architecture basic principles are:
1.	An Actor is either a Person or an Organization.
2.	Each Person or Organization has one or more SS Digital Identities associated with it.
3.	Actors (Persons and Organizations) participate in Processes.
4.	A Process acts on/accesses Things (e.g. Pet, Car, House, Business Document, Product, Assembly, Part) to perform work.
5.	Business Documents, Products, Assemblies and Parts are different from the traditional or generic Sovrin concept of a Thing (e.g. Pet, Car, House).
6.	Each Thing has one or more SS Digital Identities associated with it.

To bridge from previous versions of the ARM (see below), the following Application Architecture basic principles also apply:
1.	A DID Document is a JSON-LD serialization of a DID Entity.
2.	A DID Entity is the in-memory, application-specific object that represents a de-serialized DID Document.
3.	A DID Entity is what application developers work with (program against) at the Application Architecture level of an app.
4.	DID Entities have a set of attributes such as the following:
        -	id (DID)
        -	service (endpoints)
        -	authentication
        -	publicKey
        -	@context
        -	etc.
5.	“id (DID)” exists as an attribute of a DID Entity (and by implication, as an attribute of DID Document, the JSON-LD serialization of the corresponding DID Entity).
6.	The “id (DID)” attribute is given the nickname “DID” (aka Decentralized Identifier) for convenience; but more importantly, to clarify what a DID specifically refers to (as well as to clarify what the term DID specifically does not refer to).  “DID” should only be used to refer to the “id (DID)” attribute of a DID Entity (or DID Document).
7.	DIDs are used to index, find, and retrieve DID Documents from the Technology/Infrastructure Architecture layer.
8.	DID Documents represent the primary object type that is exchanged between the Application Architecture layer and the Technology/Infrastructure layer.

Please reply with your thoughts and feedback.

Best regards (and Happy New Year :-)),
Michael Herman (Toronto/Calgary/Seattle)

Subject: Draft DID spec: DID ARM (Architecture Reference Model) diagram version 0.11

Daniel and list,

I’ve updated the DID ARM (Architecture Reference Model) diagram to version 0.11.  I believe if we can get an agreeable “picture” of what we’re talking about, the correct words will come a lot easier …at least, that’s my experience in the past.
The ARM is posted here: 
https://hyperonomy.com/2018/12/21/decentralized-identifiers-dids-architecture-reference-model-arm/. 
Scroll down the page to the heading *Version 0.11 – December 30, 2018* and start reading from there.  If you need/want more background, start reading from the top.  Here’s a copy of what I’ve written there (minus the ARM diagram)…

Version 0.11 – December 30, 2018
The updates in version 0.11 of the Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) ARM (architecture reference model) are limited to the Business Architecture Layer; more specifically, clarifying to roles and relationships between:
        -	Actors (Persons and Organizations), and
        -	Things (Pets, Cars, Houses, Business Documents, Products, Assemblies and Parts).

The role of Actor in the model is a key learning that came out of the Basel workshop.
I’ve taken the idea a step further to find a proper “place and set of relationships” for the Sovrin concept of “Things”.  I believe I’ve (successfully?) done that but am looking for feedback/consensus about these ideas.  They are presented visually in the diagram below.
The new Business Architecture basic principles are:
1.	An Actor is either a Person or an Organization.
2.	Each Person or Organization has one or more SS Digital Identities associated with it.
3.	Actors (Persons and Organizations) participate in Processes.
4.	A Process acts on/accesses Things (e.g. Pet, Car, House, Business Document, Product, Assembly, Part) to perform work.
5.	Business Documents, Products, Assemblies and Parts are different from the traditional or generic Sovrin concept of a Thing (e.g. Pet, Car, House).
6.	Each Thing has one or more SS Digital Identities associated with it.

To bridge from previous versions of the ARM (see below), the following Application Architecture basic principles also apply:
1.	A DID Document is a JSON-LD serialization of a DID Entity.
2.	A DID Entity is the in-memory, application-specific object that represents a de-serialized DID Document.
3.	A DID Entity is what application developers work with (program against) at the Application Architecture level of an app.
4.	DID Entities have a set of attributes such as the following:
        -	id (DID)
        -	service (endpoints)
        -	authentication
        -	publicKey
        -	@context
        -	etc.
5.	“id (DID)” exists as an attribute of a DID Entity (and by implication, as an attribute of DID Document, the JSON-LD serialization of the corresponding DID Entity).
6.	The “id (DID)” attribute is given the nickname “DID” (aka Decentralized Identifier) for convenience; but more importantly, to clarify what a DID specifically refers to (as well as to clarify what the term DID specifically does not refer to).  “DID” should only be used to refer to the “id (DID)” attribute of a DID Entity (or DID Document).
7.	DIDs are used to index, find, and retrieve DID Documents from the Technology/Infrastructure Architecture layer.
8.	DID Documents represent the primary object type that is exchanged between the Application Architecture layer and the Technology/Infrastructure layer.

How does this help us manage IoT assets, mobile edge computing assets in "the fog", replicate, distribute, or discover data in the fog, etc?

@tuckerg @mwherman2000 I think a number of concepts are getting "confuded" here: 1.) Sovrin Foundation has never mentioned a "Global Data Store". That is a concept that I've had running in my mind for the past few years. It's very much a personal concept rather than a Sovrin one. I don't want to confuse that fact at the risk of getting my wrist's slapped by the Technical Ambassadors! 2.) MS's "Intelligent Cloud / Intelligent Edge" model looks like a separate thing to "Bali". The former looks and feels similar to the early ramblings of my "Global Data Store" concept. The latter looks more like a wallet.

I don't want to confuse that fact at the risk of getting my wrist's slapped by the Technical Ambassadors! 2.) MS's "Intelligent Cloud / Intelligent Edge" model looks like a separate thing to "Bali". The former looks and feels similar to my early "Global Data Store" ramblings. The latter looks more like a wallet. I envisage that "Bali" will sit on the "Intelligent Edge" layer of MS's future "Intelligent Cloud / Intelligent Edge" model. I hope that "de-confuds" things!

I was working through some of the demo scripts/software and videos on youtube. It appears that we should consider that the DID model should be considered gen3 where gen2 was oauth2+openId. I've not seen any material that covers how to frame the did model for application IAM. Should I just be considering did+verifiable credentials to be the new oauth2+openId for IAM?

Following a quick recce, I'm guessing that Phantasma aren't SSI-configured and they look to be heading down the _data reclusion_ route. I'm seeing a number of startups heading down that road but, without non-PII data being made publicly available for societal benefit, I'm not convinced by the model. Due to the bad press coming out of the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica fiasco, startups have tended towards data reclusion. The *Blinding Identity Taxonomy (BIT)* was created to help developers change that mindset. In my humble opinion, any element not included in the BIT can add great value to our tech future.

@jljordan_bcgov  Thanks for those links. I think the content suggests that it is a yes, where the verifier is some software that validates a credential that is issued to the "user". I guess to put time limits on it e.g. revocable at a certain time, the verifiable claim and revocation comes into play. I guess the specific patterns for developing a mobile or web app based on this is a developing story.

i'm not 100% if this helps, @aappddeevv 
However, I'll share a couple links in case they might be of use, and someone who knows better than me will probably have more information:
https://www.devteam.space/blog/how-to-build-a-self-sovereign-identity-wallet/
https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/connector-app
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/android-build.md

<p><strong>aappddeevv</strong> (Mon, 07 Jan 2019 18:47:07 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. That first link is a reply of the general web based demo to some degree. I reviewed the android link...the gist seems to be that its under construction so I'm going to guess that if libindy is the key dependency to a mobile based wallet (agent I guess with a wallet underneath), then a mobile agent/wallet based on it is still in the early stages. The connector-app, which I had not seen before, seems to be targeting the mobile agent/wallet concept square on.

then again, this has probably all been discussed before and decided against? :shrug_tone2:

Hi all. What are the consequences to set "trust anchor" role to any actors in my applications (organisations and each user) ? 
For more details, I try to implement the consent management by the user. For that, the user will be its own issuer of credential for "consent". He has to create his own "credential definition" and to store this in the ledger, he has to be "trust anchor".
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 15:38:43 GMT):<br/>
This is basically contrary to the design of Indy which is data driven. Verifiable credentials are collections of claims (attributes) that can be individually proven by disclosure, or use of a zero knowledge predicate (including proof of holding without disclosure of the value of the claim). In this design context a monolithic document does not make sense.  @anant706 [ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=Za3wfPY5RauSrjjXt)
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 15:40:27 GMT):<br/>
You could technically encode the blob in some manner and store that in a credential however that is likely not the most elegant solution.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 15:26:45 GMT):<br/>
There is a Sovrin Testnet (not sure of the URL right now) and BC Gov has BCovrin at http://159.89.115.24/ that can be used for sandbox purposes.  We do reset the ledger once in awhile, so be aware of that.  It has a Ledger Browser, a DID Creator and a URL for downloading the genesis file needed for connecting a client to the Ledger.  The software behind BCovrin is available at https://github.com/bcgov/von-network for running local copies.  All our docker sandboxes are based on that.

Few questions on setting up
1) Run networks on node
# This command requires the publicly accesible ip address of the machine
./manage start proxy_1,proxy_2,proxy_3,proxy_4 &

Question: so i just execute this command? or where do i put the publicly accessible ip address?


2) Special requirements for BC
Because outbound traffic from openshift is limited, we use proxies to redirect traffic from open ports by overloading ports 80 and 9418 (git).

Run 4 extra VMs as proxies (proxy_1, proxy_2, proxy_3, proxy4). Traffic should be forwarded in the following formation:

proxy_1:9418 -> von-network:9701
proxy_1:80 -> von-network:9702


Question: I am using amazon aws ec2. How can i forward this?

@firewater - BC is British Columbia.  @WadeBarnes can help you with specific questions, I think - you should DM him (unless something generally useful comes out). Wade has set up von-network instances on Digital Ocean about a 1000 times :-).  He also runs our OpenShift based instances.

@firewater, I've also updated the documentation for the repo.  I've removed section about special requirements for BC (British Columbia) OpenShift environments.  We don't have the outbound port restrictions anymore.  That section added a bit of confusion, but was there because for a while we needed to remap the Indy Node ports and IP addresses to route traffic through proxies.

Thanks, @mwherman2000 . Regarding the HL Indy data capture and semantics initiatives that are being implemented, do you envisage that information being documented in this ARM document or should that be held somewhere else?

@pknowles Ideally, I would like to include where/how schema is part of the INDY ARM...I do want it to be comprehensive.  I think a set of VC elements needs to be added first (not exactly sure how/where) ...then the schema elements on top of that??  Can you and/or Robert help out with this?

@ashokkj - the Master Secret is used by a Holder to create a blinded secret that is given to an Issuer, who then embeds it in a Credential issued back to the Holder.  The blinded secret is then proven in zero knowledge by the Holder in a proof.  It is the mechanism that proves the Credential was issued to the Holder.  An identity uses the same Master Secret (also known in Indy as a Link Secret) for all the Credentials they hold so that they can prove claims from different credentials in a single proof as all being issued to them.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=LtzfyBYJ5gnGex7rn) Thk you Paul and @kenebert. Couple comments/questions.  
1. Can/should the title on slide 7 be changed from "Credential" to "Verified Credential" to match slide 2?
2. I'm thinking the best way to start is to capture the 3-layer VC data model as a 5th perspective: "VC Data Model" ...renaming the current "Data Model" perspective to specifically be the "DID Data Model".
3. For the elements that are stored "off the ledger", where is the most likely place that these will be stored?
4. For later, what are the additional software components needed to support VCs and Schema?
I'll also need some additional information (e.g. Tx types etc. for the Technology layer, etc.).  I'll get back to you when I'm ready to add these.  I'm still digging deeper into the DID side.

@firewater - I think a lot of people are considering that issue, but there is not yet a consensus on what is the right answer - and there may not ever be. Since that question is not really an interoperability issue (interop - agents controlled by different entities being able to collaborate), it has not been a major focus of discussion. Specific agent implementations can handle that issue in different ways and still be able to communicate with other agents/other identities.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=y9PmZZ3fRAoJKeYoc) @firewater Yes - sort of.  The proof could still be proven - the resources needed for that are available to the Holder (who creates the proof) and the Verifier (who verifies the proof). What cannot be done is that the Verifier cannot find out more about how issued the Credential.  If they know already Faber's DID (because they have previously verified claims from Faber Credentials), that's OK.  But if they have never heard of them, they won't be able to find out who they were - Faber can't respond to any messages from ACME for information about who they are and why they are authorized to issue Transcript Credentials.

There are not currently any indy-node operations (and hence, any indy-sdk calls) that provide Schema -> CredDef discovery.  BC Gov has implemented a Ledger Browser by querying the Ledger for all transactions. Basically, it polls the ledger for the latest transactions by number and stores the results in a database.  Kinda crude, but it works and gives use that kind of discovery mechanism.

You can see it in use here: http://prod.bcovrin.vonx.io/

@xnopre also worth noting that there's yet to be a spec for Indy's implementation of DID Auth yet, but it's essentially going to be credential exchange. On the other hand the W3C does want to also standardize a specification I've heard. @peacekeeper has been the one who's done the most on this topic.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=3kmJNZ8HMkXyg53yY) @firewater Ah...I didn't realize that.  Sigh.  Then you would be back to the same answer as I said for CredDef from Schema - tracking the transactions on the ledger.  That's not good.

@gudkov - are we wrong on this?  CredDef returns Schema ID, but not transaction ID, and there is not an easy way to go from Schema ID to the Schema transaction?

@swcurran is there a way to run the The VON-Network Ledger Browser and API on top of my local indy network and pool? 
</p>
<p><strong>haniavis</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 21:31:42 GMT):<br/>
In the github readme, I can see installation instructions for deploying von-network together with a pool/network of nodes using docker. 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 18 Jan 2019 21:49:08 GMT):<br/>
@haniavis - Should be able to. Some thoughts on doing that:

- The Ledger Browser code is in the `/server` folder and there is a start webserver bash script in the `/scripts` folder.  That's the main part you would have to be able to run.
- You can look in the dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files to see how it is built and deployed.
- I suspect you could just change the place in the code (script) where it is getting the genesis file use the one from your local code.

If you are still at a deadend, I could connect you to the dev that wrote it.

@kdenhartog i still didn't get it how does it use for login and maintain login session in the site?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Mon, 21 Jan 2019 05:41:46 GMT):<br/>
login goes through a connection protocol setup, and once the connection is setup, credentials can be passed to increase privilege of the user to account the different role levels that the website has.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Mon, 21 Jan 2019 05:42:16 GMT):<br/>
So, if it's just a general user using the website, they just need to go through the connection protocol. If it's an admin of the website, they need to present a credential.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Mon, 21 Jan 2019 05:43:37 GMT):<br/>
Ultimately, every form of authentication relies on the setup of a connection which exchanges keys. These keys can then be used to derive authenticated symmetrical encryption keys which is how the user is authenticated. As long as both parties can encrypt and decrypt messages, the "session" remains valid.
</p>
<p><strong>firewater</strong> (Mon, 21 Jan 2019 05:46:36 GMT):<br/>
so every exchange of information that requires login credential requires an exchange of keys?

2) Now, let say i have a credential issue from ACME. I tap on the ACME credential given and it directly login to ACME website or mobile app.
3) Every other connection then it will be done on ACME website or mobile app in a login session stored

Not sure if this is the correct way to do with SSI login and how can i implement that.

this is one flow that could work. The way I've imagined this is that the user would show up at the website, and click a "login with sovrin" button that would setup a connection between the user's browser agent and the website's server. Then once the connection is setup, the website could request proofs that meet the business flows. Then when the user returns the browser agent would recognize the URL (through a browser handler potentially) and submit a trust ping automatically on behalf of the user, and if correctly responded to, the user would have their data loaded and would be "logged in". If any part fails, such as the trust ping, then the website would load the original sign up page that the user originally saw.

As I reread your message, one thing I want to point out is that sessions don't "expire", keys do. This is important because in traditional session based systems, they rely ona a caching mechanism between sessions to have good UX. However, the caching mechanism is the point most often exploited in traditional IAM.
</p>
<p><strong>firewater</strong> (Mon, 21 Jan 2019 06:03:26 GMT):<br/>
that would be the case for browser agent. what about a mobile app agent to ACME browser and mobile app interaction?

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Mon, 21 Jan 2019 06:04:17 GMT):<br/>
Different agents but similar flows. Rather than using a URL handler you could use something like a schema handler.

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Mon, 21 Jan 2019 06:07:39 GMT):<br/>
Essentially what you're wondering about is connection protocol setup which is actively being developed as an Indy-HIPE PR right now. We've been investigating this and believe we have a solution where mobile OS and browsers like android, iOS, and Chromium based browsers, provide us with the tools to make this possible.

Hi fellas, 

1) in hyperledger indy, does the owner of the node role is steward ?
2) in hyperledger indy, in order to establish connection end user with trust anchor, does trust anchor had to host a api server to process the connection request ?
3) in hyperledger indy, what type of format or source can trust anchor provide in order to let end user get it's data such as DID , verkey for establish connection ?

</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 13:19:33 GMT):<br/>
Hey, these are all excellent questions. Quickly (since I'm about to board a plane): 1) yes, the role of a node owner is called a steward. 2) I think the simple answer is "yes", but the devil is in the details. Many stewards will be trust anchors (in Sovrin all stewards are automatically trust anchors), so stewards are already hosting the necessary API. 3) QR codes are currently one of the main formats being used to bootstrap a connection. As for the details on that, I'll defer to the geniuses on this channel.
</p>
<p><strong>nemesisinhell</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 13:53:07 GMT):<br/>
@drummondreed , thanks for the answer. There another question : is it possible to update credential which contain data of schema ? or we need revoke and create it again ? 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 14:40:02 GMT):<br/>
@nemesisinhell - there is a repo of HL Indy Project Enhancements (HIPE), which has lots of information on direction for agents. Some are accepted and some are in pull requests.  About connections and QR codes, check out this in process HIPE - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/250d65e224b982fa56a6521f4a10b4b2c25bba81/text/connection-protocol/README.md

Regards your last question - that's a revoke and reissue process. You can't change an issued credential.  We expect that to the most common need for revocation.
</p>
<p><strong>mero</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 16:12:05 GMT):<br/>
Hi, in Indy, is it correct that revoking a credential prevents further valid proofs from being created with that credential but previous proofs will still verify as valid (if using their timestamp)?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 16:15:27 GMT):<br/>
A valid proof can be created by using ledger data from a point in time before the revocation - e.g. when the credential was created.  That might be acceptable to the verifier - it's up to them to decide if that works for them.  If they can see from the ledger that revocations have occured later, they could request a fresher proof - one from a later point in time.  

All of that depends on the use case.  What is good enough to mitigate their risk for the transaction they are trying to accomplish?
</p>
<p><strong>mero</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 16:22:49 GMT):<br/>
Ah, ok, but the prover wouldn't be able to provide a proof with a timestamp later than the revocation? And if the verifier accepts the older timestamp (i.e. verifies with revocation data from the ledger up-to that timestamp) the proof would be valid?
</p>
<p><strong>mero</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 16:22:49 GMT):<br/>

I was just wondering, when issuing credentials, what information actually gets published to the blockchain?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 00:36:02 GMT):<br/>
@ShivanshVij - no information gets published to the blockchain. A credential goes from the Issuer to the Holder - and into the Holder's wallet.

So during verification what does indy do to verify that a credential is legitimate? What does it compare to the blockchain?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=ZabpbbEeZuG3iXyJC) @ShivanshVij A proof in Indy proves 4 things:

- the issuer of the credential.  This is through the Credential Definition that is in the Credential and is found on the Ledger.
- that the identity providing the credential is the holder. This is through a "link secret" that is embedded in the Credential and provable only by the holder
- that the Credential has not been tampered with. This is based on a the signing of the credential based on public keys that are in the Credential Def.
- that the credential has not been revoked.  This is based on revocation information found on the ledger and linked to the Credential Def.

All of that data is either shared between the Holder and Verifier or pulled from the Ledger.

The only additional thing that the Verifier has to do on their own - determine if they trust things that the Issuer says.

@swcurran - do i understand correctly that any revocation of Credentials *has* to go to the ledger? That means that the Ledger will probably contain mostly revocations after some time?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=qpuLGw9n8ayYRisuJ) @alexmayrhofer It's not a one-to-one transaction on ledger per revocation. Basically, each time an Issuer wants to issue one or more revocations of credentials, they write a transaction that updates an accumulator and related entries. So a busy service, say a Driver's Licence, might be send a transaction a day.

But yes, it's a lot of transactions to achieve the ZKP property.

Inside samples/nodejs/ :
    npm install to install all NodeJS dependencies
    npm run ledger:start to start the ledger Docker container (needed for some samples). You must have docker installed.
    node main.js to run all scripts
        Or node <filename.js> to run a specific sample    
 when I run: samples/nodejs/src$ node main.js
I get an error:

@Sandeep I've seen this issue pop up a few times, could be a wallet handle left open or other call the demo doesn't account for.  Do you have a hidden directory `.indy_client`
</p>
<p><strong>haggs</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 15:16:13 GMT):<br/>
If so, try deleting it and retry?

@haggs you can delete the .indy_client directory.  it does delete all your pool and wallet information (obviously)

Hmm yes I should probably look deeper.  Right now in the Indy-dev repo we just blast away directory but that probably shouldn't be the answer. See this: https://github.com/kdenhartog/indy-dev/blob/20eb31e03dbe7ff7d01c04241acf41b8c7ca03ce/scripts/cleanup.sh#L12

No, unfortunately it's stuck at 1.6.2 for dependency issues https://github.com/kdenhartog/indy-dev/blob/20eb31e03dbe7ff7d01c04241acf41b8c7ca03ce/indy-dev.dockerfile#L20

@kdenhartog is this docker only available on your fork? We should try to move as many people to the official fork :) If they want to of course
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 15:31:47 GMT):<br/>
The docker image is based on the testing environment. However all the supporting files are different.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 15:32:51 GMT):<br/>
The problem is it's not at a point where I find it ready for the official repo.

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 15:34:00 GMT):<br/>
It only supports python at this point and I'd like to add some of the Agents able to build in there. At that point it's making the sdk repo super heavy.

@Sandeep it depends on how you set it up.  if its the demos, these are to the console.  you will need to set environment variable RUST_LOG=error.  there is some documentation on it:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/wrappers/nodejs/README.md

<p><strong>Sandeep</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 16:34:53 GMT):<br/>
@MattRaffel. I am just using the network that was provided in the demo. I am trying to connect to that network from the host machine by creating a simple node js application. I created app.js file to open this connection. Do I have to do `RUST_LOG=trace node app.js`. If so, where can I find the logs ?. I am sorry to keep asking this as the documentation is a little hazy on debugging.
</p>
<p><strong>Alexi</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 16:39:15 GMT):<br/>
If I want to set up a test network is it better to use the indy-node docker set up or is the docker pool network described in the sdk repo pretty much the same thing?
</p>
<p><strong>Sandeep</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 16:50:03 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=HWzTRhnkctyCKa2dP) @MattRaffel @MattRaffel . I have enabled trace on the docker containers and I dont see anything in the logs when I try to open a connection. Since I am connecting to the docker container from the host, I changed the IP address in pool_transaction_genesis to 127.0.0.1 as well. I can see the logs being generated when I run the sample code. The problem there is nothing indicating an error.

@Sandeep if you can redirect that to a file then find the call to create pool.  we want to see what is being sent
</p>
<p><strong>Sandeep</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 16:52:42 GMT):<br/>
do you want the pool_transaction_genesis file ?

<p><strong>Sandeep</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 16:57:52 GMT):<br/>
@MattRaffel That is the problem. I dont see that call in the logs. Am I missing something connection wise ?.  Do I have to anything different as I am trying to connect to the node containers from the host machine (not from another docker container) ?
</p>
<p><strong>MattRaffel</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 17:05:02 GMT):<br/>
the actual rust library call would be 'indy_create_pool_ledger_config'
</p>
<p><strong>Sandeep</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 17:12:21 GMT):<br/>
Yes. I can see the call in the logs. But that was done the web_server container that started with the network. I dont see the call being executed when I run it from the node js application.

if you changed something in your local copy you will get another hash. 
it is the cause of the error you receives.

<p><strong>coderintherye</strong> (Sat, 02 Feb 2019 01:12:53 GMT):<br/>
they are discussed here https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot6-santabarbara/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/sovrin-web-of-trust-3-primary-roles.md but are not mentioned in the auth rules https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/auth_rules.md

In the document the “Holder” trust hub is a concept that is derived from our work in British Columbia that we just announced a beta production release of last week. Https://orgbook.gov.bc.ca 

You can read about the thinking behind that service here at https://vonx.io as well as links to all the demos, api, repos. 

Finally that idea has evolved into a “credential registry” which we are turning into an Indy sub project ... early repo here https://github.com/bcgov/indy-catalyst @coderintherye [ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=aKoi8yGY2KZMK89xJ)

Hi friends,
I installed von-network, and build TheOrgBook as well as Permitify files. network is running successfully, and i can use complete Alice "Indy Demo World" example on browser as "localhost:8080/". But i'm confused about somthing as modified data regarding Alice or New Person Registration, where is this data is saving in local machine. And how i can perform this verification with production site like "https://orgbook.gov.bc.cs". can anyone please tell me some working procedure about these verification or how it will work on my Live project.

Thanks in advance

Thanks in advance

Hi all, I'm trying to call `ledger.build_get_cred_def_request` function (from Python wrapper) with credential definition ID equal to `5gbiALqa61XAgcoamTXRRX:3:CL:5gbiALqa61XAgcoamTXRRX:2:Transcript:0.3:TAG5` (obtained from `issuer_create_and_store_credential_def` function). After that I get an error saying that this ID must be an integer number (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/f9db04a182acdc2968e9956c1ec21be29048272e/libindy/src/services/ledger/mod.rs#L220). What is the correct way of calling `build_get_cred_def_request` function or how do I get credential definition ID value properly?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 12:04:47 GMT):<br/>
@apspdfoknd can you post a snippet of your code? I think the issue is that you're not submitting the cred_def or schema_def to the ledger before making this call.
</p>
<p><strong>apspdfoknd</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 12:50:21 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog Sure! source code: https://pastebin.com/MAqgQTtk and its output: https://pastebin.com/7AbsKvdA 
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 13:20:43 GMT):<br/>
I'm not certain this is what's causing the error for you, but I found a problem. On line 25 you provide the schema which doesn't have the seqNo in it. If you move line 43, 44, and 45 above line 22 and provide s in line 25 that should solve it.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 13:20:49 GMT):<br/>
@apspdfoknd 
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 13:23:43 GMT):<br/>
the schema returned on line 10 doesn't include the seqNo, so when the issuer calls `issuer_creates_and_stores_cred_def()` it doesn't have a reference point for the schema on the ledger and breaks later calls. It's one of the more tricky bugs to catch I spent a few days tracking that one down in the past.

<p><strong>Sandeep</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 22:09:36 GMT):<br/>
@here. What is the difference between credential offer and a credential request ?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 22:14:50 GMT):<br/>
@Sandeep  A credential offer represents the perspective of the issuer and what they're prepared to offer. The credential requests represents the perspective of the holder, and represents what they're prepared to receive. If there's a discreprency between the two, it means there's a negotiation between the holder and the issuer (not easily supported with the SDK currently) where as if it's the same, it means the two parties have agreed and they can now move forward with the actual issuance of the credential.
</p>
<p><strong>Sandeep</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 22:18:33 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @kdenhartog .  So when a holder requests credentials from an issuer, an issuer would send a credential offer. Holder would then use this credential to create the appropriate credential request. Is that correct ?.

Can the issuer of the credential and verifier of the credential be two different parties ?.  Lets say Company A issues credentials on behalf of Company B to Alice.  Can Company C verify Alice's credentials by sending a request to Company B. Is such type of architecture possible in Indy ?.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 07 Feb 2019 16:58:59 GMT):<br/>
The ledger allows for verification by company C without communicating with A or B.  Any of the parties can provide the information from the ledger, so the verification interaction can happen online or offline.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 07 Feb 2019 16:59:47 GMT):<br/>
Company C must have a way to know that the issue key (controlled by B represents company A--there are multiple ways to do that)
</p>
<p><strong>bharadwajambati</strong> (Thu, 07 Feb 2019 17:11:54 GMT):<br/>
Can you please elaborate on what do you mean by issue key and suggest one way of implementing this ?

<p><strong>haniavis</strong> (Thu, 07 Feb 2019 18:00:57 GMT):<br/>
So, I would like to ask if there are any known efforts to integrate Indy with Fabric in the same system, so to use Fabric as a general purpose ledger and at the same time call an Indy network for Identity management instead of using the native identity management mechanism of Fabric.

Thank you @pknowles on behalf of many contributors to this effort. The INDY ARM represents the sum total of several peoples' contributions of time and patience in explaining these concepts BB, AB, and SB (Before Basel, At Basel, and Since Basel).  All the mistakes and wrong assumptions are mine but the INDY ARM is truly a community effort.  In fact, the reason for moving it to github today, is that some of the Indy partners are asking their experts to look at it and we needed a better place for them to record their feedback.   "Make it work. Make it work better. Make it work right."

hello all, was wondering if anyone could answer a question: if i am working on a solution that is connected to a local pool of nodes, would it be best to keep the pool open at all times? or would it be better that whenever i make a call that requires the pool handle i open it, use the handle then close it again? I am asking as if i use the latter wouldn't there be a problem when two calls are made that require the pool to open since they both make an open_pool call and a pool with a specific name can only be opened once. In a sense i know i am answering my own question, but then I am wondering what the close_pool call is for then. I hope this question makes sense

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 08 Feb 2019 18:31:47 GMT):<br/>
@apspdfoknd - transformation of credentials is extremely difficult because of the signatures/cryptography around the credential that make them verifiable. Transforming the data will likely invalidate the applied cryptography.

hello all, I had a question about when creating a credential:

"Faber prepares both raw and encoded values for each attribute in the Transcript Credential Schema. Faber creates the Transcript Credential for Alice."

```
  # note that encoding is not standardized by Indy except that 32-bit integers are encoded as themselves. IS-786
  transcript_cred_values = json.dumps({
      "first_name": {"raw": "Alice", "encoded": "1139481716457488690172217916278103335"},
      "last_name": {"raw": "Garcia", "encoded": "5321642780241790123587902456789123452"},
      "degree": {"raw": "Bachelor of Science, Marketing", "encoded": "12434523576212321"},
      "status": {"raw": "graduated", "encoded": "2213454313412354"},
      "ssn": {"raw": "123-45-6789", "encoded": "3124141231422543541"},
      "year": {"raw": "2015", "encoded": "2015"},
      "average": {"raw": "5", "encoded": "5"}
  })
``` 

how are the values encoded in the examples? is there some sort of standard that has been used thus far?

hello all I was wondering if someone could tell me what the second value in a schema ID represents.
in other words: 
issuer_did : ? : schema_name : schema_version
for example:
`4NiiH9wnpF9VKxw28fJj3h:2:test:0.1`
what is the 2 ? it seems it always returns as two, is this the protocol version?
</p>
<p><strong>Alexi</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 22:17:31 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=EqtPfP6GcAGBjkfPq) so I found the source code for creating the id:
```
pub const SCHEMA_MARKER: &'static str = "2";
...
impl Schema {
    pub fn schema_id(did: &str, name: &str, version: &str) -> String {
        format!("{}{}{}{}{}{}{}", did, DELIMITER, SCHEMA_MARKER, DELIMITER, name, DELIMITER, version)
    }
}
```
I see now that it is in fact always a 2. I am curious, I am assuming that given different id's the 2 simply represents that this id is one of a schema correct?

<p><strong>Alexi</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 22:43:51 GMT):<br/>
is it common practice to use the same credential definition for multiple credential offers? or is it best practice to make a new definition for each offer
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 22:55:07 GMT):<br/>
The same definition is typically used. If it's the same credential, using a different credential definition for each one is redundant. Someone else may be able to offer a more thorough explanation.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 22:55:30 GMT):<br/>
@Alexi ^^
</p>
<p><strong>Alexi</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 23:01:39 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm  thanks! so even if an issuer is sending multiple credentials to different people, it would still be okay to use the same credential definition yes?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=uqm3P8nvwY2FCnusJ) @pknowles Paul, I've had several conversations with the folks from Shyft (as well as SecureKey who are essentially in the same business): helping companies monetize their information assets with a particular focus on monetizing individuals personal identity data (with no value accruing/returning to the individual).  I've written about both companies here: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/canadian-banks-trafficking-digital-identities-canadians-herman/   I don't know anything about their technology platform but philosophically, Shyft is completely divergent (IMO) from the concepts behind SSI.

I use the stable Sovrin deb repo (` "deb https://repo.sovrin.org/deb xenial stable" `), but after running the command `sudo apt install -y sovrin` I obtain the following outcome:
```

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created

The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:

It tries using 'https://repo.evernym.com/artifactory/libindy-maven-local' but that doesn't connect to anything when it tries to get them pom or jar ('https://repo.evernym.com/artifactory/libindy-maven-local/org/hyperledger/indy/1.7.0/indy-1.7.0.pom')

<p><strong>DavidP</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 09:36:36 GMT):<br/>
I found the following description for cryptoAuthCrypt in the sdk: _ender can encrypt a confidential message specifically for Recipient, using Sender's public key. Using Recipient's public key, Sender can compute a shared secret key. Using Sender's public key and his secret key, Recipient can compute the exact same shared secret key. That shared secret key can be used to verify that the encrypted message was not tampered with, before eventually decrypting it._
My question is: How does it work? If you encrypt the message using sender's public key, only the sender could decrypt  the msg... I understand, that the sender add his public key into the message and generate a shared secret key from his private key and public key of the receipt. Is it right? Why you don’t sign the message with the sender private key and then encrypt with the receipt public key?

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 16:33:17 GMT):<br/>
@DavidP Underneath, we're relying on libsodium's box and box_seal to handle this. When encrypting first thing we do is use the sender's private key and the receiver's public key to encrypt the message. We're then packaging the outputed ciphertext, the sender's public key, and the nonce into a structure called ComboBox. Then we're Anoncrypting (libsodium.box) this struct which requires only the receiver's public key because box is generating an ephemeral public key and appending the sender's public key to the ciphertext as the output of libsodium.box_seal(). Then for decrypting, we first call libsodium.box_seal_open() and the function knows how to parse the ephemeral key from the ciphertext and decrypt the message with the private key provided by the receiver in the API. This then reveals the ComboBox struct which then takes the information and calls libsodium.box_open() to decrypt the plaintext message provided in the authcrypt originally. This is finally returned with the sender's public key as well.

Hi all, I would like to publicly announce Hyperledger Indy's new documentation website: https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io

It is still a little rough around the edges, so please give your feedback on github at https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-docs/

Each of the individual repository documentation libraries can be found in the respective repositories under the `docs/` folders. While the documentation is currently very contributor oriented, we invite everyone to contribute to more developer and user facing documentation to drive adoption. 

To understand how to contribute to documentation, please review https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs.html and the HIPE: https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/hipe/en/latest/text/0025-indy-docs-framework/README.html

I will be posting a short video tutorial later on these pages for greater clarity. Thanks for all of your great work!

Hi all, a quick question about Hyperledger Indy. When a verifier verifies a credential from a prover(for eg. a transcript) how is the private information in a credential (eg. name, ssn, gpa etc) verified in a certificate using the `schema id` and the `cred_def_id`? I tried looking into `anoncreds.verifier_verify_proof` function, but if someone could briefly explain it would help immensely. This is in reference with the getting_started guide for Indy. Thank you!

Hi all, how can I join the global TestNet as a steward? I've got the whole procedure done up till generating a verkey, a BLS key and a PoP key by running the `sudo -i -u indy init_indy_node <alias> <node_ip> <node_port> <client_ip> <client_port>` command.

Hi @ruggero.montalto-tno, since your company is already a Steward on the Sovrin MainNet all that is required for you to participate on the TestNet as a Steward is to add your Steward DID to the TestNet (send the request to support@sovrin.org). In other words, you do not have to have a validator node on the TestNet or any other Sovrin network, to be able to use that network for the purposes they were built for.  That said, we are pleased to accept any offer of validator nodes for any of our networks as we are expanding rapidly and plan to provide and help maintain several networks for many different purposes.  I have seen your chats in the Sovrin Rocket Chat Steward channel, but wanted to respond with more info here for the benefit of you and anyone else who might have the same question.

I was able to look into this, and there's some functionality (such as Holder generating proof based on cred_def which is linked to issuer DID) but I'm not certain I understand exactly what you're looking to achieve yet. Could you provide a more specific scenario? 
</p>
<p><strong>kpratihast</strong> (Sun, 24 Feb 2019 12:57:20 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=BucAKFaipnGsq6nXu) @kdenhartog Let's say the the Verifier has published a proof request wherein the 'requested_predicates' condition states that one of the attributes let's say 'age' has to be greater than 18 and there's a restriction applied that it should match with the credential issued by a Issuer on his/her DID. The Holder will pull the credential from his wallet which satisfies this proof request. The output of 'proverGetCredentials' method doesn't reveal Issuer's DID. So my question is there any method that Holder can use to fetch the Issuer's DID  which  he/she can eventually use to generate the proof?

Can anyone tell me what are the trade-offs that come with using Indy as opposed to some other blockchain such as Quorum? My immediate application is focused on self-soverign identities, but in the future I want to expand our offerings to include functionality that is more like Quorum and I am worried about being constrained from building general purpose smart contracts.
</p>
<p><strong>Doug-K1</strong> (Sun, 24 Feb 2019 19:23:01 GMT):<br/>
If Indy is purpose built just for Identity and a poor fit for other applications I suppose I could run a Quorum or other chain along with Indy in a configuration similar to The Ductchess Project  http://bit.ly/2tBrVM8 - I would be interested to hear from anyone that is using a multi-chain strategy and why they chose it.

Below is an excerpt from a draft readme for work we are doing in the Indy world. You can find full readme here -> https://github.com/bcgov/indy-catalyst/blob/master/README.md

Also our open community website is https://vonx.io

Main point is that Indy offers capability well beyond the narrow problem of personal identity. 

“It is important to note that while these emerging standards and technologies are being designed to tackle the very difficult challenges of secure and privacy respecting digital identity for people, they are not limited to the narrow context of personal identity. This new model can be applied to a broader set of use cases beyond those involving personally identifiable information. The model offers a generalized capability enabling highly secure entity to entity communications and it is this generalized capability that has led to the creation of Hyperledger Indy Catalyst. Indy Catalyst components enable enterprises to issue, hold and verify data about entities.” @Doug-K1 [ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=qHNe2kAqPYC9Hb7T4)

Do you have to be on the indy network to issue credentials?. Can credentials be issued if you can get hold of credential definition id of an existing credential definition on the network ?. Also, does the same thing apply for verification as well ?. Can the verifier submit a proof request and verify the received credentials if he knows the credential defintion id and credential schema id without being on the network ?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=7N3wN2hsNmv8WN9T6) @Sandeep You cannot use an existing CredDef to issue Credentials - you have to create your own.  A CredDef includes public keys that are used to sign the claims and the CredDef creator must have the private keys for those public key.

On the verification side - yes that is how it works.  From the proof, the verifier gets the CredDef(s) ID and then gets the CredDef itself from the ledger. From that, the verifier can check the signatures on the claim (no tampering) and gets the DID on the ledger of the Issuer.  The verifier can then investigate as necessary the Issuer to decide if the credential they issue can be trusted.  It make take some work to make that "do I trust the issuer" work.

@swcurran . Without being on the network, how can the verifier create a proof request with a specific credential defintion id ?. Is there a discovery feature for seeing the available credential definitons on the network ?. Lets say Company B wants to create a proof request with credential defintion associated with Company A. Is there a way for Company B to see all the credential defintions created by Company A ?

You have the right way it should work, but there are other ways to do it that sidestep the currently tricky problem of the lack of discovery on the ledger.  

The verifier could ask for any cred def that has a given schema, but that gets back to the same question - how to know what schema are on the ledger? 

The verifier can "know" it from other sources - e.g. someone could post a list of useful schema/cred defs (e.g. a curated list of Driver's Licences).  This is a useful model as one also has to know what is the issuer behind a cred def - which means connecting to the DID and finding out who the issuer is and what is their process before issuing a Credential.  Do you trust the issuer and it's processes?

Discovery can be implemented in the same way that https://indyscan.io/ works - load the interesting ledger transactions into a ledger and track them.

This is a pretty deep topic.  Easy at first, but gets trickier.  Doable and will be solved, but there is work to do.

@swcurran Can a holder of a credential initiate a credential sharing request with a verifier without the verifier submitting a proof request first ?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 17:06:08 GMT):<br/>
Yes - we have done that. They could generate the proof request themselves, and then just provide the proof request and proof to the verifier.

We have considered this for the in-person proof scenario. The prover selects a standard proof request, generates a proof and sends it somehow (perhaps QR code) to the verifier - say a bartender. The verifier then can verify it.

i see that one would install a packaged binary with `sudo apt install sovrin`, but beyond that, a quick scan of their website doesn't show me documentation on how to use it. It is my understanding that it is merely built on top of Hyperledger Indy, so I have not bothered with an in depth study of Indy. :thinking:

@mwherman2000 I think it should read like this:

```
Send can encrypt a confidential message intended only for Recipient. Sender computes the Diffie Hellman shared secret from his own private key and Recipients public key. Recipient can compute the exact same shared secret key by computing Diffie Hellman with his private key and Senders public key. The shared secret key verifies the encrypted message has not been tampered, then decrypts the message.

Hello, I've created the binaries of libindy for android...
I've successfully created the zip file for arm64-v8a as instructed in the url: https://indy.readthedocs.io/projects/sdk/en/latest/docs/build-guides/android-build.html#building-binaries-of-libnullpay-for-android
I have also followed the steps to place the *.so files into jni lib...
When I tried to build the apk on phone one-plus 5t(whose architecture is aarch64) the application is crashing...

The error log is:
java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: dlopen failed: library "libgnustl_shared.so" not found

While the supported arm64-v8a files are 
1) libindy.so
2) libindy_shared.so

Hey all guys! I am trying to setup an Indy pool, where I only have a trustee, a steward and a validator node. When running the generate_indy_pool_transactions script, only the node keys are saved, this means that no more steward and (hence) nodes can be added to the pool. On the other side, I tried to generate the needed keys and start a pool with only one trustee, one steward and one validator, but by debugging the indy-cli client, I found that the validator node shows a public key of [0, 0, 0]..., and the assertion rc == 0 (src/curve_client.cpp:267) stops the execution.
</p>
<p><strong>Diiaablo95</strong> (Wed, 06 Mar 2019 11:46:51 GMT):<br/>
Apparently, the generated test pool and domain transactions (with 1 node and 0 clients) and the my pool and domain transactions look the same in structure. Nevertheless, I cannot manage to connect the indy-cli client to the pool.
</p>
<p><strong>Diiaablo95</strong> (Wed, 06 Mar 2019 11:46:59 GMT):<br/>
Do you guys have any suggestions concerning this?

@swcurran does Indy support DID Doc ?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 08 Mar 2019 02:26:40 GMT):<br/>
@pawan_pandey - Indy supports the concept of DIDDoc, but it
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 08 Mar 2019 02:26:40 GMT):<br/>
@pawan_pandey - Indy supports the concept of DIDDoc, but it not as documented in the current spec.  It is in the works.  The DIDDoc spec is still evolving.
</p>
<p><strong>pawan_pandey</strong> (Fri, 08 Mar 2019 02:27:45 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran so how does resolution happen currently in Indy?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 08 Mar 2019 02:28:01 GMT):<br/>
In the indy-agent world, support for off-ledger DIDDocs is being used and that will lead to full DIDDoc support on ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 08 Mar 2019 02:29:59 GMT):<br/>
As noted - the concept of resolution is the same.  A DID is asked for of the ledger, and the ledger returns the attributes associated with that DID - the public key and endpoint.  The Universal Resolver takes as input a DID in spec form, turns that into a query of the Indy ledger, and returns a formatted DIDDoc.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 08 Mar 2019 02:31:04 GMT):<br/>
Here is an example of the universal resolver handling a DID on the Sovrin MainNet - https://uniresolver.io/#did=did:sov:HR6vs6GEZ8rHaVgjg2WodM
</p>
<p><strong>pawan_pandey</strong> (Fri, 08 Mar 2019 02:38:20 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran , can Indy handle a scenario where an issued credential has to be revalidated for example: e-Apostille
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 08 Mar 2019 02:38:52 GMT):<br/>
Don't know what that means?

A use case where a degree issued by an educational institute of country A has to be notarized in order for it to be accepted by an educational institute in country B
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 08 Mar 2019 02:44:18 GMT):<br/>
Indy basically eliminates that scenario as the characteristics of the proof enables it to be used globally.

If there was a desire to keep the ancient, paper-based process, there are several ways that could be done.  For example, Holder proves the credential to a Notary, who issues an "It's Good!!!" credential to the Holder, who proves bother to the educational institution.

Indy basically eliminates that scenario as the characteristics of the proof enables it to be used globally.

If there was a desire to keep the ancient, paper-based process, there are several ways that could be done.  For example, Holder proves the credential to a Notary, who issues an "It's Good!!!" credential to the Holder, who proves both to the educational institution.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 08 Mar 2019 02:44:44 GMT):<br/>
That process is just to mitigate a risk of forgery, and that's what Indy does.

Hello Friends
We have seen your Alice example of Hyperledger Indy and appreciate your efforts. 
I am trying to understand the execution flow of the entire Alice example. but not able to understand.
Kindly share something which can help to understand the execution flow of the project.
I am checking the logs after ./manage build and ./manage up command but not getting fair idea to understand how the execution happening.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=runZyogjX29mcwgSY) @Rchauhan Yes, all of the code works:
1. Use these instructions to setup your local environment: https://github.com/mwherman2000/indy-dev/blob/master/README.md#windows
2. Use the `getting_started-verbose.py` from here: https://github.com/mwherman2000/indy-dev/tree/master/python

I'm still working on the Getting Started Guide (GSG-EA) ...hopefully completed by the end of the week.  Progress was interrupted while I was working on the 2 roles and actors diagrams when I realized there wasn't a good resource for understanding the relationships between and across Sovrin roles.  That led to me completing the first version of the Sovrin Governance Framework Comprehensive Architecture Reference Model (SOVRIN ARM):

Hi everyone, I'm developing a POC on indy. In the issuer agent the error WalletAlredyOpen (206) is raised in case of two concurrent open_wallet. How do you manage concurrent open request? In the von-agent implementation example a lock is applied on each request but seems very strange in case of massive concurrent request. Thanks

@mwherman2000 Are you set on the sovrin-arm name? It seems to me that the ARM TLA can be confusing to many developers. Since there are ARM architecture builds some developers may be mislead

hi all, we were trying to follow the getting started guide using the indy-sdk and got stuck here in step 2: 
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/docs/getting-started/indy-walkthrough.md#step-6-credential-definition-setup

basically, our problem is that we don't know what the "primary key" is supposed to be.
in the indy-sdk, a primary key in json format is a mandatory parameter.

from the help function:
`indy> ledger get-schema help` > `primary - Primary key in json format`

we couldn't find any info on this so far. can anyone point us in the right direction?
thanks!

Hi all. I have been toying around with Indy for a few months now. I understand this is a whole new animal and docs/processes/whatever are ever-changing, but does anyone have a current, completely functional road map for installation and setup of the basic foundation of Indy? The docs currently out there are very difficult to follow and a lot of errors thrown (for me anyway) in a lot of different steps. Any help would be stupendously appreciated! :-)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=58zzJ5vdicD6GPzdv) @lorenz.loesch Are you running an old version of indy-cli?  Here is what I get from the cli "ledger get-schema help":

indy> ledger get-schema help
Command:
	ledger get-schema - Get Schema from Ledger.

Usage:
	ledger get-schema did=<did-value> name=<name-value> version=<version-value>

Parameters are:
	did - DID of identity presented in Ledger
	name - Schema name
	version - Schema version

Examples:
	ledger get-schema did=VsKV7grR1BUE29mG2Fm2kX name=gvt version=1.0

<p><strong>lorenz.loesch</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 14:43:22 GMT):<br/>
hi @ianco, thank you. I just noticed that i asked the wrong question.
my question concerns the `ledger cred-def` command, which definitely has the mandatory `primary` parameter.
</p>
<p><strong>lorenz.loesch</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 14:47:29 GMT):<br/>
to clarify, the question is what the `primary` parameter is supposed to be and where we can get it. 
thank you for any input ;)
</p>
<p><strong>lorenz.loesch</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 14:48:31 GMT):<br/>

Parameters are:
	schema_id - Sequence number of schema
	signature_type - Signature type (only CL supported now)
	tag - (optional) Allows to distinct between credential definitions for the same issuer and schema. Note that it is mandatory for indy-node version 1.4.x and higher

I want to set up the Hyperledger Indy network, so I find the document that is getting-started(https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/stable/getting-started.md#install-indy) but the document is so hard to setting the network.
Could you tell me how to set up the network? or any document?

Hi, I am wandering how to design the management services in my system(based on indy), there management services may include the features like issuers can manage the credentials they issued(etc revoc), the system admin add/delete an entity(maybe DID) and even the clients can manage their credentials in their wallets. So are there any modules or even ideas that Sovrin or Indy have to reach these requirement?

Hi friends, I am trying to make build for indy java wrapper but when executing command mvn clean install facing issue relate to POM file 
"Could not resolve dependencies for project org.hyperledger:indy:jar:1.8.1: Failure to find org.hyperledger:indy:jar:1.8.1-dev-985 in https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2 was cached in the local repository, resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of central has elapsed or updates are forced "

I also tried to make the changes as suggested in readme file like below.
1. Inside repositories tag block add:
    
    
    <repository>
        <id>sovrin</id>
        <url>https://repo.sovrin.org/repository/maven-public</url>
    </repository>

2. Inside dependencies tag block add:    
    
    
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.hyperledger</groupId>
        <artifactId>indy</artifactId>
        <version>1.8.1-dev-985</version>
    </dependency>

but again facing same issue, can someone please suggest how to resolve this.

Due to clock changes, the call time for today's *Indy Semantics WG* call remains the same for US participants but is an hour earlier than usual for European participants! For more information regarding the specifics, go to #indy-semantics

The View Credential link also works ...it invokes whatever you provide as the Credential URL.  MOOCs like edX use this same mechanism to (programmatically) post verifiable confirmations of course completions, etc.

Hello Indy Friends, please suggest how to change default wallet storage path

<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 20 Mar 2019 13:49:49 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=sbFMK9YwZQSieKzsq) @bharadwajambati Indy-cli does not have agent functionality. It is primarily used to interact with the ledger for storing DIDs, schemas, and credential definitions. Creating connections between one party and another is a function of agents. Today, there are a number of agent implementations being actively worked on. A small directory of at least some of those agents can be found at https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent/blob/master/README.md#known-agent-implementations

<p><strong>bharadwajambati</strong> (Wed, 20 Mar 2019 19:12:56 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm  thanks a lot. Is there any documentation which corresponds to indy-cli?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 20 Mar 2019 19:25:28 GMT):<br/>
Assuming we're talking about the the CLI contained in the indy-sdk repo, it does a decent job of self documenting with the help commands. @bharadwajambati 
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 20 Mar 2019 19:27:56 GMT):<br/>
This design doc has a fair amount of information as well but I think most of that is encapsulated in the help commands: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/docs/design/001-cli

Team...I have question on where the pair-wise DIDs are stored. As per this https://www.evernym.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/What-Goes-On-The-Ledger.pdf   pairwise DID is stored off-ledger but as per this https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/docs/getting-started/indy-walkthrough.md  nym_request = await ledger.build_nym_request(steward['did'], decrypted_connection_response['did'], decrypted_connection_response['verkey'], None, role)
await ledger.sign_and_submit_request(steward['pool'], steward['wallet'], steward['did'], nym_request) both faber and steward store the pairwise DID using the NYM transaction. Am I correct in assuming that pairwise DID is stored in the indy ledger?

Hi guys, I’m Mateusz, new here, can you give me hits how can I help you with project? Do you have a list with ongoing tasks?

I have also second question, I tried to play around with Indy and I stucked myself at connecting to pool. I have created it with ./start_pool script so I have nodes running in Docker containers. To connect to pool I found out that I need to create pool config, and pool config needs genesis transactions, but genesis transactions are stored in docker containers, so I’m not sure where I should run my IndyCLI. Should I try to connect in a) docker container aka Node1 or b) it can be completely other machine but copy genesis transaction file from one of the containers (I tried it, without success). My errors are probably TimeOuts: “Pool ‘myPool’ has not been connected” . 
Do you have any tips?

On the front of running through the Getting started guide, I'd checkout https://github.com/kdenhartog/indy-dev
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 23:06:36 GMT):<br/>
However, I think you'll find more value out of the AgentBook work which can be found here https://bit.ly/ibc_ab
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 23:07:34 GMT):<br/>
This is another option I'd suggest that's in between the two and would be helpful https://github.com/hyperledger/education/tree/master/LFS171x/indy-material/nodejs

In general senario, suppose if Alice wants to prove her degree certificate to the bank then how could she prove that? The video ends without the full demo, if anybody here knows how to do it then please share the link.

I have just cross posted a message to the Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger TSC lists announcing that with the CII badge now complete we are ready to move Indy from incubating to active status.  Please reply with any additional information or support you think would be helpful.  I'm hoping we can get to a :+1: from the TSC this week.  (@SteveGoob I also added your google docs page to the wiki so everyone can see and edit it -- fixes and improvements welcome!)

Hi everybody I'm not sure if I'm right here, I'm trying to do the tutorial https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/docs/getting-started/indy-walkthrough.md In step two I get that the command pool.create_pool_ledger_config is not known, better to say the second part of the command create_pool_ledger_config. As far as I know I have everything installed according to the prerequisite. Can anyone help me?
Thank you

@dhuseby what's our vector victor

<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 18:42:51 GMT):<br/>
LOL
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 18:49:28 GMT):<br/>
@dhuseby done  was over under and under was over done
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 18:49:28 GMT):<br/>
@dhuseby Dunn was under Over and I was under Dunn.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 18:50:50 GMT):<br/>
 So, Dunn you were under Oveur and over Unger.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 18:51:02 GMT):<br/>
That's right. Dunn was over Under, and I was over Dunn.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 18:51:13 GMT):<br/>
So you see, both Dunn and I were under Over, even though I was under Dunn.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 18:51:21 GMT):<br/>
Dunn was over Under, and I was over Dunn.

<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:21:11 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder ok, I've got an 8-core, 32 GB of RAM machine under my desk running Ubuntu 18.08
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:21:31 GMT):<br/>
it used to be the built bot for the Rust toolchain for *BSD and few other architectures
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:21:39 GMT):<br/>
but it's sitting idle at the moment
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:21:55 GMT):<br/>
I want to add it as a runner to the Ursa CI/CD pipeline
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:22:10 GMT):<br/>
I have logged in
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:22:11 GMT):<br/>
you should be able to trigger the pipeline
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:22:13 GMT):<br/>
added an SSH key
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:22:21 GMT):<br/>
I've installed the gitlab-runner package and docker
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:22:24 GMT):<br/>
everything is there
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:22:32 GMT):<br/>
I just need to get a runner token
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:22:41 GMT):<br/>
oh hold on
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:22:50 GMT):<br/>
everything says I should be able to create a token by going to the project page and clicking settings and then creating a runner token
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:22:57 GMT):<br/>
wait! don't create it for me
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:23:09 GMT):<br/>
the HL CI/CD proposal is to have this be self-service
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:23:23 GMT):<br/>
did you turn that off or is that how Gitlab just is?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:25:30 GMT):<br/>
I'm not creating it for you
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:25:35 GMT):<br/>
you should be able to just see it then
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:25:53 GMT):<br/>
Go to the settings -> CI/CD -> Runners and you should see the token
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:26:03 GMT):<br/>
settings?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:26:11 GMT):<br/>
in the left column of buttons?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:26:58 GMT):<br/>
there is no "settings" for me
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:27:24 GMT):<br/>
I can go to "user settings" and there is a thing for access tokens there
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:27:29 GMT):<br/>
but I don't think that is it
</p>

@MALodder anything?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:55:35 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder I think I know what's going on
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:55:41 GMT):<br/>
looking at the permissions of Gitlab: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html#gitlab-cicd-permissions
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:56:00 GMT):<br/>
only the maintainer and admin roles can add specific runners
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:56:21 GMT):<br/>
I want developers to be able to add runners as well
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:56:34 GMT):<br/>
I guess it is ok if the developer has to ping a maintainer first to get an access token
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:56:40 GMT):<br/>
I'm ok with that
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:59:15 GMT):<br/>
okay try it now
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 19:59:32 GMT):<br/>
you should it now if you refresh
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 20:10:16 GMT):<br/>
got it
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 20:46:18 GMT):<br/>
:thumbsup: 
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 21:15:15 GMT):<br/>
I can't get it to build ursa tho
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 21:15:26 GMT):<br/>
tried the rust:latest as the default docker image
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 21:15:46 GMT):<br/>
but the build yaml doesn't install libsodium-dev package
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 21:15:56 GMT):<br/>
you'll have to look at the jobs to see the messages
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 21:16:05 GMT):<br/>
I have my runner using docker as the executor
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:14:42 GMT):<br/>
here is the Dockerfile I use to build an image that works for the runner
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:14:47 GMT):<br/>
```
FROM ubuntu:18.04

</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:18:45 GMT):<br/>
so why isn't that getting done when the job is run on my box?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:18:53 GMT):<br/>
or do I have to build my own custom docker image
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:19:01 GMT):<br/>
and set that as the default image for my runner?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:19:18 GMT):<br/>
if that's the case, shouldn't we check this dockerfile into the repo?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:20:12 GMT):<br/>
or better yet, publish a docker image under the HL docker hub account so that we can all just set our runners to hyperledger:ursa-builder?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:21:05 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder the gitlab docs suggest that the .gitlab-ci.yaml file can specify which image to use and the one in the runner's config is only used when one isn't specified in the CI yaml
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:21:21 GMT):<br/>
I think we should do the follow:
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:21:35 GMT):<br/>
1) check in the dockerfile into the project repo
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:22:24 GMT):<br/>
2) publish the docker image on docker hub under hyperledger:<project>-builder  (as opposed to hyperledger:<project>-test)
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:22:44 GMT):<br/>
3) check the .gitlab-ci.yaml file into the repo
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:23:10 GMT):<br/>
4) document how to set up a runner on the wiki and in the readme file
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:23:20 GMT):<br/>
yes it can but we haven't set up the registry yet
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:23:38 GMT):<br/>
the .gitlab-ci-yaml will have it pull a prebuilt image when we finally get that running
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:23:45 GMT):<br/>
then you won't have to build the image yourself
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:23:50 GMT):<br/>
gotcha
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:24:02 GMT):<br/>
so now I have to run that dockerfile and then change my runner.conf to use the built image?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:24:12 GMT):<br/>
for now, I mean
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:24:26 GMT):<br/>
then all we'll have to do is just add the `image: ubuntu-rust` name value pair at the top of the .yml file and runners will be all set
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:24:31 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:24:52 GMT):<br/>
or you can set the runner to use the shell executor
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:25:11 GMT):<br/>
I think we should be moving to publishing docker images under hyperledger:<project>-builder on docker hub eventually
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:25:20 GMT):<br/>
that would be awesome
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:25:27 GMT):<br/>
we have a docker hub account I think
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:25:44 GMT):<br/>
I really want it so all docker images are pulled from predefined and accepted images
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:25:46 GMT):<br/>
if not, I think I might know somebody who is allowed to set that up for Hyperledger

</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:26:27 GMT):<br/>
why not change the dockerfile to start with rust:latest instead of ubuntu:18.04?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:26:37 GMT):<br/>
the rust docker images are published by the rust team

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:27:29 GMT):<br/>
what OS is rust:latest?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:27:39 GMT):<br/>
I think debian
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:27:51 GMT):<br/>
which could be a problem
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:27:59 GMT):<br/>
trying it now
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:28:15 GMT):<br/>
the debian packages tend to be overly conservative when it comes to tracking updates
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 23:28:23 GMT):<br/>

*HyperLedger Indy Getting Started Guide for Enterprise Architects and Developers (INDY GSG-EA)*
https://github.com/mwherman2000/indy-gsg-ea/blob/master/python/doc/getting_started-enterpise.md#hyperledger-indy-getting-started-guide-for-enterprise-architects-and-developers-indy-gsg-ea

The HyperLedger Indy Getting Started Guide for Enterprise Architects and Developers (INDY GSG-EA) documents an end-to-end framework for analysing a business problem such as the Alice Buys a Car user story; then undertaking the design and implementation of an executable self-sovereign identity (SSI) solution that meets the requirements of this (or any similar purchasing) user story. This guide also introduces the use of several enterprise architecture concepts into the new world of SSI application analysis, design, and implementation. To achieve this goal, the guide uses the ArchiMate visual modeling language standard and the Archi open source, enterprise modeling tool for analysis and design. The implementation is a simple Python script. Architects and developers who are new to the HyperLedger Indy SSI software platform (Indy platform) and the Sovrin SSI governance framework (Sovrin framework) will gain significant new knowledge and understanding about the design and implementation of SSI solutions using the approach documented in this guide.

<p><strong>justinr3</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 13:24:54 GMT):<br/>
Hi everyone, I'm having an issue with the void callback used for the Java wrapper in version Indy 1.7.0. It doesn't seem to pass check_useful_c_callback!(cb, ErrorCode::CommonInvalidParam4); 
</p>
<p><strong>justinr3</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 13:27:14 GMT):<br/>
And the end result is that I'm getting the InvalidParam4 exception, as expected if the callback didn't pass the check.  From looking at the code, there really isn't anything I can do externally to prevent this error. I'd appreciate some advice!
</p>
<p><strong>justinr3</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 13:43:16 GMT):<br/>
For reference, 1.5.0 seemed to work just fine for me. The difference I see is that 1.5.0 uses checkResult(result), while 1.7.0 uses checkResult(future, result) in the Java createWallet wrapper. The voidCb is exactly the same between versions.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=kjqBinc2mHWyRCk6E) @silviu Sorry, I took a few days out of the office.
Self sovereign identity means that the user is in control of their identity attributes. It can be used to meet federated identity use cases. In general, you don't want identity information on an immutable ledger because it will erode privacy. Users should store their own identity information which they exchange in a peer-to-peer fashion, and use the blockchain as a root of trust.
</p>
<p><strong>silviu</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:20:04 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=EPhHqqFqPfDJZ4z4P) @esplinr thank you very much for the answer. really helpful. Let's say, there are 2-3 companies, that would like to use a federated identity management based on the blockchain. But they want for example, to delete one employees identity from the system, when the work contract is terminated. Could this be done with SSI ? who hast the control in such a situation ?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:22:23 GMT):<br/>
The employer issues a credential to the employee saying that they are employed. The employee can share that credential with anyone they want, who can verify that it is valid using the employer's keys on the ledger. Other companies can use that credential to automate entering the employee into their vendor management systems.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:23:07 GMT):<br/>
The employer can revoke the credential. At this point, the employee can still share the credential, but the people who receive it will see that it is revoked when they try to validate it. They then know to remove the employee from their systems.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:23:45 GMT):<br/>
The Sovrin network doesn't currently solve the problem of notifying everyone that the credential was revoked.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:23:54 GMT):<br/>
That's a privacy concern.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:24:29 GMT):<br/>
Though businesses could use Sovrin to establish a trusted relationship with the employer and use that communication channel to receive the notification.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:24:33 GMT):<br/>
Does that help @silviu ?
</p>
<p><strong>silviu</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:28:34 GMT):<br/>
@esplinr yes, that's really useful information and makes sense. are we talking about a federated identity management system based on Sovrin or hyperledger indy in general ?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:29:20 GMT):<br/>
Sovrin is a deployment of Hyperledger Indy. The code is the same. You could do the same thing with Indy, but then you have to recruit everyone into your walled network instead of using the public utility that Sovrin provides.
</p>
<p><strong>silviu</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:33:48 GMT):<br/>
that means that, i could deploy my own version of "sovrin" in a federated way using hyperledger indy, based on a private network and the service would be used just for a conglomerate of organizations and their employees, am i right?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:34:32 GMT):<br/>
Correct. Others are doing that. But over time, I expect you'll find it's more trouble than its worth. Using Sovrin provides the same privacy guarantees without the headache of running your own consensus network.
</p>
<p><strong>silviu</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:35:47 GMT):<br/>
how would be access management managed in such a network? Smart contracts or it there a better way ?

</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:37:21 GMT):<br/>
Access to what? The employer only issues credentials to the people who should have them. The credential is provided by the employee to whomever they want. There is no global database to restrict access to.
</p>
<p><strong>silviu</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:38:41 GMT):<br/>
access to diverse services, or even internal resources for example
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:39:21 GMT):<br/>
Sovrin doesn't manage internal resources. It manages the credentials the user uses to prove that they are authorized to access the resources. Once the credential is revoked, they lose access.
</p>
<p><strong>silviu</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:39:22 GMT):<br/>
let's say a university would want to make difference between professors and students and the services they want to access

</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:40:04 GMT):<br/>
It flips the access management model on its head. The user is in control of the information that they share.
</p>
<p><strong>silviu</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:40:52 GMT):<br/>
ok, i find this complicated and i'm not sure yet how access management be implemented

<p><strong>silviu</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:40:52 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:41:15 GMT):<br/>
You grant access based on the user being able to provide a credential saying they should have access.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:41:23 GMT):<br/>
They have to provide the credential every time they want access.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:41:28 GMT):<br/>
If the credential is revoked, you don't provide access.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:42:14 GMT):<br/>
There is no central database to reference. The proof of the credential that the user provides has everything necessary to show it is valid, so long as the root keys are available on the global ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>silviu</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:44:54 GMT):<br/>
how are the grants managed ? does it need another service to take care of that ? because if the identity is valid, is doesn't mean a user can access all the services
</p>
<p><strong>silviu</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:45:05 GMT):<br/>
can access be granular managed ?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:45:41 GMT):<br/>
The person providing the service will need a system that checks the credential and decides what to do with that information. That is beyond the scope of Sovrin.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:46:33 GMT):<br/>
Sovrin solves the specific problem of proving something about an individual, organization, or thing in a decentralized manner. It doesn't have much to say about what you do with that information.
</p>
<p><strong>silviu</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:48:22 GMT):<br/>
ok, that's clear now. Any idea, if there's a blockchain based system, that could take over access management ?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:49:27 GMT):<br/>
There are efforts underway to implement DIDAuth and a DID-OpenID integration that could be used for this use case.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:50:39 GMT):<br/>
The key idea is that you don't want a blockchain handling access management. You want individuals to present the credentials that you then use to manage the access to your system. That provides flexibility and separation of concerns.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 20:50:55 GMT):<br/>
That is what we mean when we use terms like self-sovereignty and decentralization.

To avoid confusion with naming I started experimenting with the schema for the URN like:
```
did-schema:sov:1231415124151
did-overlay:sov:13215512312
did-schema-element:sov:5814108410924

```
` 
But I think everyone would agree that this is not the way to go. Personally I like the concept of reusing main @context in DID document to tell resolver what type of the content it is. Similar to the idea with MIME Type in the document resolved via HTTP/S
So as soon as the I will try to resolve `did:sov:8291239123` I check the @context of the document to figure out with what I have to deal and for example it could be:
```
  @context: ["https://domain.com/language/v1"]
  @context: ["https://domain.com/control/v1"]
  @context: ["https://domain.com/..../v1"]

```

I can't remember what other type of units we were talking about during the conf but those two are the most needed right now control is relation between did and public key, where language is did and data schema/language - something which describe how to talk not who controls it.

@pknowles Paul, on this whole subject of addressing immutable content objects (like schema definitions) with DIDs, see the current state-of-play about how this will be done in the DID spec in these two Google docs. The first one describes the matrix parameters proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TctFY8euBH2wq7Z8c9KccICDZUGZplvhoqlHlFMahGk/edit?usp=sharing
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Sun, 07 Apr 2019 02:03:59 GMT):<br/>
The second one is for contributors to write up their own use cases for DID URLs in the 3 syntaxes under consideration. Should only take any W3C Credentials Community Group member 5 mins to write up your own examples: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VpYPvUw2o-01e727bCy2V-0MUEe0_NB-EqX677scQbI/edit?usp=sharing

By "same blockchain" you mean the same distributed ledger?

<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 21:34:53 GMT):<br/>
But there are solutions that rely on running both as you said, Indy for tracking identities and Fabric or Burrow for the smart contracts.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=X6yThm5fJYR4bypW6) @Zohaib_Sohail Hi @Zohaib_Sohail , a master secret is a secret piece of information that a credential holder contributes to all their credentials. This gets signed by the issuer using a CL signature currently without them learning the value. The holder can then use knowledge of this secret to prove the credential was issued to them. I had a go a writing this up a while back - https://blog.goodaudience.com/cl-signatures-for-anonymous-credentials-93980f720d99 (may not be 100% accurate but its pretty close)

@Zohaib_Sohail - the education repo is a snapshot of the indy-agent nodejs that was created for the course. So the indy-agent repo is where you want to look. In my opinion, where it needs to go is to along the lines of the indy-agent python implementation that is able to pass the tests in the indy-agent test suite. There are a couple of people that have contributed to the nodejs implementation that might be able to give you a bit of guidance.

<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Wed, 10 Apr 2019 16:22:09 GMT):<br/>
@hpduong I believe that orgs might want to run their own validator nodes, but they could also just contract with a validator if they need that type of service.  I think the Trust Anchor is just similar to a root_certificate holder in TLS system.  Just a starting point (if you want it) to establish a chain of trust for your proof.  Maybe others who are more informed can qualify that answer but that's the one I believe I've run into before.
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Wed, 10 Apr 2019 16:23:04 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>anikitinDSR</strong> (Wed, 10 Apr 2019 16:28:27 GMT):<br/>
@hpduong well, if you are worrying about your data, then you can backup '/var/lib/indy' directory. But, during upgrade procedure, some of data structure can be changed and corresponding migration scripts will be executed automatically. The steps like "backup data and reinstall indy-node to the latest version" does not guarantee ledger's compatibility. It's very important point if you want to upgrade from the very old version to latest. Also, upgrade procedure will make a backup of data and will restore it if something going wrong

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=ahBPhSnkTjufhvY2c) @Zohaib_Sohail Once we get to steady state with a global implementation (e.g. Sovrin), the vast majority of issuers will not be validators. Stewards (as they are called in Sovrin) must go through an onboarding/certification process, so an issuer can't just one day say "I want to be a validator".  It's basically a separate business question.

The term "trust anchor" is being phased out in favour of "Transaction Endorser"). It basically means a DID that has permissioned write access to the ledger.  See the V2 Sovrin Glossary - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gfIz5TT0cNp2kxGMLFXr19x1uoZsruUe_0glHst2fZ8/edit#heading=h.i4y80elx0tpb

If you would like to help decide on the name, please respond to this survey sometime within the next 30 hours.  https://forms.gle/5s879DB2Kp37DZYe7

A few reminders for the poll: question 1 has an other option for suggestions, question 2 is for objections (it is harder to find new name suggestions buried in negative feedback).
Also, please vote for *all* the options you can support, this poll doesn't have ranked voting but I am watching for names that have general acceptance and a second choice vote will help push the best names out in front.
Finally, you should be able to edit your responses, as I review new suggested names those will be added to the poll, so feel free to come back and add checks to names you like or add objections to the new suggestions.
</p>

The problem is that I'm trying to add it with a Trust Anchor, as described in https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/node/en/latest/transactions.html#attrib, but I'm constantly getting an error message: `client request invalid: UnauthorizedClientRequest('Only identity owner/guardian can add attribute for that identity',)`

Do you know if this is supported?

Hi All!  I'm updating an application and noticed a change here:  vcx::api::issuer_credential::vcx_issuer_create_credential where previously a cred_def_id was needed to make the call and now a cred_def_handle is requested.   I've looked through the API and am having trouble finding a way to retrieve the cred_def_handle of a given cred_def_id.  Any thoughts on best way to go about this?
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 21:22:24 GMT):<br/>
@twshelton you get the handle by using the .handle method on the object. When you need to save and reuse it, serialize the object and save that. Then to retrieve it and get the handle, deserialize the saved serialized object, then get the handle of the restored object.

Hi everyone, I'm still having an issue with the void callback used for the Java wrapper in version Indy 1.7.0. It doesn't seem to pass check_useful_c_callback!(cb, ErrorCode::CommonInvalidParam4). Could this be  Java version mismatch related issue?
</p>
<p><strong>justinr3</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 14:40:46 GMT):<br/>
The code related to this issue looks to be the same in 1.8.2 as well, so I'm just wondering if anyone else has run into this issue when using the Java wrapper specifically.

what is the benefit of having credential schema and credential definition?
</p>
<p><strong>pranavkirtani</strong> (Sat, 13 Apr 2019 04:13:24 GMT):<br/>
why not just have schema
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Sat, 13 Apr 2019 13:47:19 GMT):<br/>
A schema is general and only has the claims that it is comprised of. A schema can be used by any DID owner. A credential definition is an instance of a schema created by a particular DID owner and annotated with public key material per claim. It is the data object that is used in the issue and verify sequences.  @pranavkirtani [ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=ihXzGGh72FbZpCfDX)

If you go here https://sovrin-mainnet-browser.vonx.io/browse/domain and use the Type filter you can see schema or cred defs on the Sovrin Mainnet

@MoonLee The indy software is purpose-built to hold DIDs, schemas, credential definitions and similar self-sovereign objects. There would be much better options than this for storing video data.

An update on the naming poll and project proposal: Hyperledger Aries was the clear leader in the results (by 3x).  Most of the next tier of results were vetoed by large amounts of negative feedback (Union and Connector in particular).  I am working on updates to the project proposal doc.

Hello everyone, 

For our master thesis, we are studying solutions to support account migration on the Mastodon social network (https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/177). 
In order to achieve this, we thought about distributed ledger technologies to build decentralized, human-meaningful and secured identifiers which we think could be a major update to increase the popularity of decentralized social networks.
During our researches, we found the Hyperledger Indy project and we are wondering if this project could fit our needs. We would want to allow people to have a unique ID on the network which is independent of the instance they are registered on. In this case (according to our understanding), only one DID is needed per user (or more if if want to use more than one ID) and we need to link a human-meaningful name to it. This DID will allow transfers of personal data between two instances while letting the following list of other people following you unchanged. We would also want to know if we could connect to one instance using Indy keys instead of a password. 

I hope this description of our project is understandable. We would want to know if it is feasible and what you think.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 17 Apr 2019 20:11:18 GMT):<br/>
@ONRising One of the main goals of Indy is to avoid third party collection of your personal data by correlating identifiers, so we make it really easy to create lots of global identifiers for individual connections. That would undermine your use case.

Hello Everyone,

Greetings from my end. I'm new to Indy. I'm trying to do the setup. And I think, I have lost a bit in the Ocean. 
Can someone suggest some starters so that I know if I'm going in the right direction?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=bpgxyetoww6C67a7t) @esplinr I see. Indeed, we are more interested in a way to build a global unique identifier than avoiding third parties collection of personal data. We want a way to prove your identity to two instances so they can safely transfer your data from one to the other while not losing your followers. Do you think about other project that try to solve a similar use case?

Hi, are there any performance metrics available for an indy-node network (based on the HL Blockchain Performance Metrics whitepaper - https://www.hyperledger.org/resources/publications/blockchain-performance-metrics?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social-media&utm_campaign=performance-metrics-whitepaper)? 
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 19 Apr 2019 19:04:12 GMT):<br/>
@bricg We did most of our load testing before that paper was available. Our load testing is recorded in Jira in issues like:
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1343
</p>

Hi Everyone,
I am trying to use https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain-Identity/indy-ssivc-tutorial while following those installation steps, 
I need to build the VON Network as part of installation.
So while building it by using this command `./manage build` it fails to build as it looks for particular version of indy-plenum[1.2.237] and indy-node[1.2.297] which is not even available in the version history. 
Kindly shed some light on this.
</p>
<p><strong>Raja_Sabarish</strong> (Mon, 22 Apr 2019 10:55:03 GMT):<br/>
Can someone kindly help me as early as possible as its blocking the business completely.

As a work around, I tried installing `indy-plenum` wthe the following command ` sudo pip install indy-plenum-dev==1.2.237` 
unexpectedly it throws me the below error.

@lijamie what do you mean by "wait until it is written to all ledgers"?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 23 Apr 2019 03:14:43 GMT):<br/>
I would assume you mean wait until the transaction has been committed to the ledger, in which case, the response should tell you when it's been committed because it will contain a state_root_hash. Once that's include it should be committed to the domain ledger.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=9MQCXXtpXqCjtiYmb) @nage I'm just trying to get an idea of current performance and whether there are any future targets for increased performance. I would also like to understand what are the possible scaling options for an indy-node network to cope with increase in ledger reads, writes and storage requirements. Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 15:39:40 GMT):<br/>
We have been using 10 writes per second and 100 reads per second as our performance minimum (if we fall below that we are worried).  Benchmarks can go much much faster of course, the Sovrin Foundation uses those numbers as a guideline for our production configuration on a global pool of 24 nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 15:40:28 GMT):<br/>
We would like to hit 10x on those numbers, and are confident we can with various refactoring efforts and strategic upgrades, but we haven't put out a "we want to be at X" number pending our evaluation of the options readily available to us.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 15:43:00 GMT):<br/>
Because of the protections on correlation, performance metrics don't need to be a primary focus (but any and all help here is very much appreciated).  Time correlation means that throughput spikes ought to be spread out over time, so we don't have to worry about "visa network" type numbers.
</p>
<p><strong>bricg</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 16:07:58 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=CrT7GopZieEwur3uM) @nage Thanks, those numbers are quite impressive. Sorry for my ignorance but can you explain what this means - 'time correlation means the throughput spikes ought to be spread out over time'? In terms of the 24 active nodes, do you simply see those servers scaling up to handle the extra load? Is there some sort of load balancer sitting in front of them?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 16:35:26 GMT):<br/>
yes, the system queues requests to normalize loads and we encourage clients to preallocate things they need and also postpone post objects to the ledger when possible.  This spreads out the load.  Also because information exchange happens in the peer-to-peer part of the system we don't anticipate having "holiday season" type load spikes.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 24 Apr 2019 16:40:35 GMT):<br/>
To answer the question more directly - adding nodes has a point of diminishing returns as the more nodes, the more difficult to reach consensus.  The balance is robustness of the network vs. the time to reach concensus. So adding nodes is not the "handle more load" answer.

There is no load balancer - that would be a point of failure.  AFAIK any node can receive requests and from their they are shared amongst the pool nodes.

Hi @kenebert @nage, I framed my question incorrectly during yesterday's call. My real question is, are there any schemas that have been proposed for interop of Identity data, any that follow established or legacy Identity schemas. The only one I could find was SCIM(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7643), that is focused on cloud interop, mostly focused on capabilities in administering and using  cloud based apps. Oracle Blockchain for one has extended this by using replacing the LDAP link in Hyperledger Fabric MSPs to their own IDCS(https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/blockchain-cloud/administer/set-users-and-application-roles.html#GUID-BDC739B4-AAD3-478F-9579-44CC9F87F611).

Hi, I'm wondering if there are any open source mobile app agents available that can manage credentials on Indy? 

Specifically, I am trying to run the Alice-Faber demo (or something similar), except I wanted to conduct the demo with Alice using a phone as her credential wallet.

The closest thing I found so far was the Agent Framework from Streetcred, but I couldn't get it to work to interact with the web agents from my initial testing, and I'm wondering if anyone has done any similar work for me to reference from, as I'm a little bit stuck right now...

<p><strong>nage</strong> (Fri, 26 Apr 2019 16:33:36 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB the rich schemas initiative over in #indy-semantics will allow schema.org data graphs to be used directly in credentials.  When you have selective disclosure many tokenized approaches and OCAP-like systems don't make much sense.  You are better off modeling the data directly against its use case and letting the credential holder to the mixing and matching.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=suaQaCA2gL7tHunk4) Thanks for pointing me to #indy-semantics, fascinating work. Although the credential holder would be at the center of the world in SSI, those credentials become valuable only in the degree of acceptance by verifiers in a particular use case. Verifiers may have requirements a. of the quality of the credential (issuer/issuers that are the source of the credentials) b. of the kinds of data points or derived data points they need, this might depend on the context KYC/AML for an individual versus for a corporation or a scoring app for a credit application. Are there any use case analysis through these lenses of satisfiability available. 
Dont get what OCAD or token based approaches mean in this context. Please clarify. 
ODCA writeup by @pknowles seems to be about the management of overlays laid on top of the regular schema, that could capture attestations of notions of quality among other things.

<p><strong>pknowles</strong> (Sat, 27 Apr 2019 15:30:42 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB - Thanks for the note re *ODCA*. The final representation of a regular schema should be exactly the same as a schema base and its associated overlays in compressed form. If you think about the embedded semantic tasks that a traditional schema offers: encoding, formats, labels, pre-defined entries, etc., each of those tasks has basically been given its own overlay type in ODCA. In other words, we're not adding anything new to a regular schema in terms of embedded tasks, we're just separating out those tasks into separate linked objects. We're looking at a schema as a multi-dimensional object rather than a single data object. The major benefits of representing a schema in that way are explained in the paper but I'm sure there will be other minor undiscovered benefits that we haven't come across yet. There are also other facets of the ODCA work that are not mentioned in the paper, including industry sector tagging for data object searchability and how consent is dealt with. We'll expand on those parts in future versions of the paper as the middleware tooling matures. Finally, don't confuse a regular "schema" with a "schema base". A "schema base" is only one part a regular "schema". You need linked overlays to complete the final representation of the schema. Hope this helps.

@VipinB - Thanks for the note re *ODCA*. The final representation of a regular schema should be exactly the same as a schema base and its associated linked overlays in compressed form. If you think about the embedded semantic tasks that a traditional schema offers: encoding, formats, labels, pre-defined entries, etc., each of those tasks has basically been given its own overlay type in ODCA. In other words, we're not adding anything new to a regular schema in terms of embedded tasks, we're just separating out those tasks into separate linked objects. We're looking at a schema as a multi-dimensional object rather than a single data object. The major benefits of representing a schema in that way are explained in the paper but I'm sure there will be other minor undiscovered benefits that we haven't come across yet.

Topics include: using the new auth_rules, improvements to the release process, and faster node catch-up.
@lynn.bendixsen we tailored this demo around questions we figured you would have on the release of Indy Node 1.7.0.

@pknowles when I say regular schema I mean that a schema base without its overlays, would that still make sense?  that is a multidimensional schema flattened to just the shema-base.  You seem to allude to this possibility  in your paper. Since the overlays can be added by different apps/views then those would be then "additive" or defining views. For example the type tagging from schema.org and the pii-attributes in your example could be in the schema-base and it would make sense as a schema in itself. With the addition of overlays for example at the Agent level I could add more BIT tags to attributes not in my original list (maybe there would be exceptions here, that is I can only add (not reduce my encryption level) to the pii-attributes for example). In other words the overlays are context sensitive specializations of the schema-base with some restrictions (as in the case of pii-attributes).  Then when the app that operates at a certain level or context looks at the schema, it sees the schema-base with all the overlays applied appropriate to its context. Do I have this right?

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sat, 27 Apr 2019 23:00:36 GMT):<br/>
In short schema-base is also a schema, albeit a less rich one.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=YK7ydjPi6T4YpfTFK) @VipinB A schema base provides a standard base from which to decentralize data and, as such, all PII attributes are flagged in that base object. If, for example, an issuer were to publish a schema base having failed to flag a PII attribute, a new version would have to be created in order to flag that attribute as sensitive and that new version would inevitably become the standard. In other words, that refinement would not be done via an overlay. Other than that, you're spot on. Attribute names and types from a referenced source such as schema.org can be embedded into a schema base. I'd love to see schema.org flagging PII attributes at their end but that might be a tough sell. In any case, the PII schema object would remain an integral part of schema base functionality. There are also some neat catches that we can provide to a schema issuer. For instance, you'll notice that "Free-Form Text Fields / Unstructured Data" is a BIT element. That allows us to apply some deep logic in the foundational code to warn the issuer of unstructured data prior to publishing. Here, if an attribute has a "Text" data type defined in the schema base and a linked entry overlay has not been used to add predefined field values to that attribute, it would be treated as a "Free-Form Text Field" and subsequently flagged as a PII attribute. If we were to let that slide, there would be a privacy risk as an end user would be able to potentially enter PII information into that text field (I reckon a "Ban all free-form text fields!" working group would be oversubscribed! :slight_smile:). Although there is nothing stoping a schema issuer from publishing a schema base as a stand alone object, I would strongly advocate that, at the very least, an entry overlay be constructed to accompany that object at the time of initial publish.

hello everyone ....
i have 2 question , hope to find the answers here : 
1- How to restore my wallet ?  , do we have nomemic word like ethereum wallet ?
2- Do we have browser wallet in Indy-sdk ?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 28 Apr 2019 15:13:49 GMT):<br/>
Hi @Koptan - there is no backup/restore implementation within the indy-sdk. That's functionality to be built at a higher level.

There has been some work done on a browser wallet but I think those efforts are still very early. I believe this part of the indy-agent reference repo might be a start at what you are looking for - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent/tree/master/browser-extension.  The WASM work in Hyperledger Ursa will be a driver for this.

@swcurran  thank you , what do you mean by "That's functionality to be built at a higher level." ?
</p>
<p><strong>Koptan</strong> (Sun, 28 Apr 2019 15:20:36 GMT):<br/>
another question in same context : if i have lost my phone or laptop , then how i can restore my identity ?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 28 Apr 2019 15:22:48 GMT):<br/>
Currently, full backup and restore functions are available in the indy-sdk. Using such capabilities to manage a proper backup/restore functionality useful to a person is not implemented - where does the backup go, how is it verified, how is it restored, etc. are all higher level functions.

I would also argue that we'll need incremental backup as well to make a robust solution.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 28 Apr 2019 15:26:31 GMT):<br/>
On your other question - that will depend on if you have a backup or not :-).  That's your first step. If not, you have to re-establish your digital identity in the same way you built it - start from a foundational ID - e.g. government driver license verifiable credential, and build it up from there.

It's not something anyone wants to do, hence the importance of a rock-solid backup restore.

Suggest that you take a look at Keybase and it's handling of backup/restore - at least from a UX perspective.  I haven't looked into the underlying tech but I thought the UX was pretty good.

@swcurran  :joy: , again thanks for your answers , one more question : if someone stole my phone then is there any way to disable my DIDs in that phone ?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 28 Apr 2019 15:47:09 GMT):<br/>
First line of defense is that your wallet should be locked using the capabilities of your phone - e.g. biometrically protected secure enclave (I think that's the term...). Possible to breach (although the FBI needs help to do that), but takes significant resources.

Next would/could be notifications to your contacts. This would be a UX feature, but easily done with existing functionality.

Last - there is a designed but not yet implemented feature by the Indy team that will enable an entity to disable a device from another, authorized device.  This would allow you to, for example, use a tablet or laptop to disable the lost device. With that, the data is still susceptible to access (see above), but the device would not be able to prove verifiable credentials. A Verifier would know that the proof came from an untrusted device.

@jljordan_bcgov correctly pointed out in the above that a driver's licence is not a foundational identity document.  What I should have said is just go back and get what a government offers as a foundational verifiable certificate that it issues based on its legislative authority.

@nage " tokenized approaches and OCAP-like system" - Just to clarify, does tokenized approaches refer to OAuth etc. what exactly does OCAP like system mean

<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Sun, 28 Apr 2019 18:54:22 GMT):<br/>
Object capabilities is what ocap refers to

I’m not aware of broadly adopted production systems that implement that approach. However it is something that this type of tech (Indy, other similar tech) could help us implement at scale

To add some color to this, we do intend to add some level of functionality into Aries that would support DKMS like functionality. As @swcurran pointed out though, it won't be practically usuable by a user as it will likely just be an API that will need additional UI/UX considerations.

You could have an attribute for expire then the proof could check whether the value is later than today, it is not then its expired

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 29 Apr 2019 14:33:10 GMT):<br/>
Sure, the attribute for the schema could be credential expiration date. The value could be measured as a 64 bit integer since 1970 (Unix timestamp). This could be now + 7 days in seconds that are put into the credential

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 13:18:01 GMT):<br/>
I assume this is a proof request/proof of the "govt id" for some one other than Alice (with whom, as I recall, it seems to work).  This is a known error in the implementation, that has not been resolve.  The other proofs - transcripts, etc. work as expected.

If you want to explore a later version of the same work, look at the nodejs folder in the https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent repo.  The edx repo has a snapshot of that code base, and that code base has subsequently evolved, particularly around that gov't credential.

Hi , today i had demo about indy in my company , and all of theme they ask one question : if i collected my data and i put it in my wallet and it took me like  3 months to gather all my identity like : ID , Driving licences , Work Experience ... etc , then for some reason i lost my wallet so how i can recover my wallet with my data if i don't have any backup ? 
</p>
<p><strong>Koptan</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 13:23:38 GMT):<br/>
because usually normal people they don't backup their phone or device :nerd:
</p>
<p><strong>Koptan</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 13:24:47 GMT):<br/>
So please tell me if there is any way to recover my wallet with data !
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 13:43:07 GMT):<br/>
The answer to that is that backup has to be baked into the agent app that you use.  It can't be an option that people setup, or part of their backing up of the phone.

One approach that we think will be common is that there will be a cloud component of the agent, and your encrypted backup bundle will be stored there.  That cloud portion will also serve as a persistent endpoint so that messages are stored and forwarded to your phone when you are offline.  The backup will be encrypted with keys that you control.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 13:45:34 GMT):<br/>
That said, the keys you use to backup your data need to be saved by you and *controlled* by you - the tricky part. There are a variety of ways to do that - different devices you have, paper, shared amongst friends. That will take some extra work/planning by a person.  There is work going on in this area - it will be a crucial part of the security/experience balance.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=cKvtiJpSfEAKNQxBb) @rfu2k Great questions. I realize this is in the Indy channel but I'll answer them for Sovrin specifically. I'll hit them 1 by 1.
1. That's right.
2. That's also right.
3. There is an _idea_ of costs. They will be low :) But you're right, that functionality isn't implemented yet.
4. You're right, the costs are pooled and used for running the network. The Sovrin Foundation Economic Advisory Council is the group responsible for deciding how that fee revenue is apportioned amongst the Foundation, stewards, etc. There are many different parties thinking hard about the long-term plan but in the very short-term, there is no policy for sharing this revenue with stewards. If you're interested in joining the conversation, the Governance Framework Working Group is always open. 
5. That's right - but you could imagine a scenario where institutions or service providers subsidize the cost on behalf of the holder/user.
6. There's no charge to be a steward, if that's what you mean when you say network member. The Foundation has the Sovrin Alliance which does have an annual membership fee, but it also has perks that go along with it. The primary purpose for the Alliance is to throttle Foundation staff's time. Everybody wants an hour with @nage of course, and same for many others on the team, but our general policy is that we spend time with those who are spending time/money on the open source. The Alliance lets us also spend time with commercial entities who want our time to help them with their business or commercial needs - or who just want to support the Foundation's mission by supporting it. Many stewards are Alliance members simply because they want to see the Foundation succeed. 
Hope that helps. You're definitely on the right track. Feel free to ping me if you have questions. :)

Hi All - pretty new to Indy, but not blockchain ;-).

In the basic use-cases for Indy, it doesn't seem to accommodate the following type of problem, just wondering if I'm missing something!

  - Alice wants to send $10 to Bob
  - The payment processor needs to know that both Alice and Bob are UK citizens
  - Alice can send, along with $10, an attestation from a sensible issuer (e.g. government) that the payment processor can validate on Indy using Alice's DID.
  - However the payment processor can't validate Bob's a UK citizen without some further interaction with Bob, so Alice can't complete the action unilaterally.

To solve this we'd need Bob to be happy publicly (or at least somewhere accessible to the payment processor) to make his UK citizenship attestation public. Is there any provision for on-chain claims to be stored on Indy as well as DIDs / schemas etc.? Of course this would be much less private as anyone with access to the ledger (presumably anyone? - is it possible to run sync’ing, non-validating nodes with Indy?) could tell that Bob’s DID (and Alice’s and anyone else) was associated with this un-encrypted attestation.

<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Wed, 01 May 2019 01:59:59 GMT):<br/>
@adamdossa couldn't the processor hold the amount in escrow until it could validate Bob's credentials if that's a necessity to operate in that regulatory env?
</p>
<p><strong>adamdossa</strong> (Wed, 01 May 2019 03:28:58 GMT):<br/>
It could do, but generally to send money to someone else, only the sender participates in the protocol - i.e. you can't stop me sending money to you by refusing to cooperate ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>adamdossa</strong> (Wed, 01 May 2019 03:29:27 GMT):<br/>
(i would need to know your "identifier" of course - in this case your bank details, but that's not really particuarly private information)
</p>
<p><strong>adamdossa</strong> (Wed, 01 May 2019 04:04:38 GMT):<br/>
The only sensible approach I guess is that the payment processor needs to hold both Alice & Bob (and anyone else who wants money to be able to be sent to them) KYC attestation (acting as an agent), and then it can validate whatever pair of users is necessary for a particular transaction.

Hey guys, I have become comfortable with Hyperledger Fabric... I am starting to look at other Hyperledger projects Like Indy... I was wonder id some one could explain to me how the information is stored and how it travels through the network. By information I mean an Identity? What is stored on the ledger a hash of my identity? 
</p>
<p><strong>Switch2Logic</strong> (Wed, 01 May 2019 07:36:17 GMT):<br/>
I am also wondering if their is any production level tutorials? Or like a bear minimum setup so that I can learn Indy from the ground up just like I did with Hyperledger Fabric? I know I can go take the tutorial apart and create my own docker images. This way just takes a lot of time :(.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 01 May 2019 14:32:55 GMT):<br/>
indy-sdk is the core functionality for handling transactions with the network, storage, wire messages, etc.  indy-agent use the indy-sdk to build higher level functionality like establishing connections, credentials exchange, etc.  Agents tend to be language specific, so as agents mature, they will be the basis for most development - for building app specific functionality.

What is i am trying to achieve here is : some time the job seeker will apply for job , then he will send his identity to the company , but after that he got rejected from the company and they haired someone else ,
so in this case the company will still have access to the job seeker identity , so in this case how solve this issue with Indy ?
</p>
<p><strong>Koptan</strong> (Wed, 01 May 2019 14:50:37 GMT):<br/>
i think the job seeker should revoke this identity ? or can we put expiry date on the proof ?

<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Wed, 01 May 2019 14:56:00 GMT):<br/>
@adamdossa it depends on the regulatory env.  I can certainly deposit $1 in your account with a lot of anonymity but if I walk into your bank and want to deposit $10k that will at least necessitate me sharing some form of credentials for KYC regulations in the Western World
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Wed, 01 May 2019 14:56:09 GMT):<br/>
at least if a payment processor is involved
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Wed, 01 May 2019 14:56:28 GMT):<br/>
we can however always meet on the street and hand each other cash but that seems like a different type of transaction than what you're describing

they do know when the expiration date is or how much time is left before its reached

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 01 May 2019 15:09:24 GMT):<br/>
@adamdossa - it's an interesting use case.  I'm guessing that the question is wrong, but here are a couple of issues with how you have it framed.  First, in Indy, no credentials go on to the blockchain.  They are issued to the Holder of the credential, and used by the the Holder to prove things.  Second, you would not be able to use another person's credential without their consent, so using a an issued identity credential to prove citizenship (or whatever) cannot/should not be done unilaterally. 
</p>
<p><strong>adamdossa</strong> (Wed, 01 May 2019 15:31:28 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran thanks - that makes sense. The way I am thinking about it now is that the payment processor is an agent that would hold the KYC credentials (not on-chain, but locally) of any users it wants to be able to transfer funds between. It would be up to Alice & Bob to provide their credentials to the payment processor if they want to be able to use it. The payment processor then just verifies the credentials it holds for Alice & Bob (using the Indy ledger for validation) - assuming everything is kosher, it allows the payment to proceed, if not then it would need to go back to Alice & Bob (e.g. if Alice's credentials had expired).

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=ZckKgBT4NPtqRDnp8) @swcurran Thank you for the clarification... So I basically understood correctly. Just another question: When a Institution Issues a DID/certificate it is sent to the ledger and also to lets say the users agent that also maintains a wallet. Is the actual certificate stored with the issuer and the certificate owner?  When an versifier wants to verify my credentials I send my DID they check the ledger and get my DDO. The DDO is sent to my agent/me it is signed with my private key and sent back to the versifier. Is the issuer ever contacted through the verification process?  Or is the trust mostly in the ledger. Is it possible to verified the certificate with the actual issuer?  I hope I am framing this correctly... Please do correct my errors of thought...
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 02 May 2019 19:53:11 GMT):<br/>
Question: Is the issuer ever contacted?  The issuer is not contacted in the context of the credential and holder - the Verifier doesn't contact the Issuer to get any more about the holder. However, the verifier has to decide if it trusts the Issuer. To decide that, it may have to contact the issuer ask the issuer who it is - perhaps by requesting a Verifiable Credential about it's authority to issue the credential.  For example, when receiving a transcripts credential from a student issued by a University, the verifier may ask the University - are you an accredited school.

<p><strong>pimotte</strong> (Fri, 03 May 2019 10:10:57 GMT):<br/>
Is there any documentation on (steward/trust_anchor/etc) roles and how indy functions as a ledger, sort of on the same level as the getting started guide of indy-sdk? A colleague of mine suggested that this was what was sort of missing for a newcomer and I couldn't really find it.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 03 May 2019 14:57:48 GMT):<br/>
@pimotte Newcomers generally shouldn't need to understand the details of the ledger, since it's abstracted by the SDK. But you can get more information here:

Hey people! I have a question regarding *Verifiable Credentials and Zero-Knowledge proofs*: let's say I wanna prove to my employer that I am an employee of the company without revealing who I am. I wanna do that because I can have a 10% discount. Is it possible for me to collude with another person, who is not an employee of the same company, to pass my credentials or my proof to that person so that he/she gets the same discount?
</p>
<p><strong>Diiaablo95</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 13:02:52 GMT):<br/>
In other words: is there a way to enforce something similar to Mandatory Access Control for credentials and derived proofs?
</p>

Hey people! A new question (I am working with Indy and underlying concepts in my M.Sc. thesis). *Is it possible to use ZKP with my identity provider, without revealing my identity?* I mean, can I prove that I am a member of that "club", for instance, without revealing what my identity is? So that I do not need to generate a new DID everytime I interact with my identity provider? Thanks! :)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=tay47zhbBzwxMJrbB) @Diiaablo95 Not without also providing them with your entire identity. You must share all of your credentials or none of yours which becomes a major deterrent because that would mean sharing your medical credentials, financial credentials, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>jaromil</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 16:21:32 GMT):<br/>
how comes a single credential is dependent from others? I'm not familiar with this implementation, working with one where credentials are independent from one another.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 16:25:36 GMT):<br/>
We bind credentials with a link secret rather than to a DID. This means that you need to use a common link secret for all of your credentials so that you can combine the individual credentials together during a proof offer.
</p>
<p><strong>jaromil</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 16:31:48 GMT):<br/>
ACK. ingenious! is there a paper that references this? I don't understand it fully yet, while it interests me to understand indy better. what prevents me from sharing a common link secret and a single credential? is it a new computation necessary every time there is a new credential?
</p>
<p><strong>jaromil</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 16:35:45 GMT):<br/>
is the link secret common to all DIDs? a crypto paper would help

Good day, I am having a little trouble understanding some concept about DID's. I understand each party has a public DID. and then they share a private relational DID. so they both can identify each other.  From the documentation it seems like the public DID's are stored on the public ledger. When party would like to connect to another they do so with their public did? I am confused with the initial interaction just before they exchange private DISs of ledger...  Could both parties not expose each others public DIDS? Does this matter?

There are a few docs that may help ... I think you are considering the initial invitation process, a good question and an interesting problem that is context dependent. Are the parties known to either other, in physical proximity, is it a well known digital service, and other such considerations.

Hello everyone. 
I have some problem with revocation. Use-case is: issuer issues 2 similar credentials (using the same schema, credDef and revocation registry) and verifier tries to verify both. Verification of the second credential fails if we don't revoke the first one before it. Do you have any test which cover this situation? Is it correct use-case at all (do Indy allows to perform such flow)? 
Thanks in advance.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 18:29:23 GMT):<br/>
You should be able to verify both credentials without revoking either of them. Are you writing the updated revocation registry to the ledger after each credential issuance?

Hi all,

<p><strong>jadhavajay</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 20:03:05 GMT):<br/>
This is probably a very basic question. Can two different Indy networks talk to each other? For ex. In a scenario, an Issuer issues a credential on Network A, to the holder on Network B?
</p>
<p><strong>jadhavajay</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 20:03:21 GMT):<br/>
Is it possible?
</p>
<p><strong>jadhavajay</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 20:05:09 GMT):<br/>
Assuming that the public DIDs of these two organizations are on different network.

Hey all, a quick question about creating schema definitions. Is this completely up to the discretion of whoever's making these right now, or are there a set of reference/recommended definitions for certain common types of credentials (e.g. driver's license, passport)?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 20:41:26 GMT):<br/>
This falls more into the territory of agents. Issuers don't need to have any knowledge of Network X to issue a credential with their public DID anchored to Network Z. Holders don't need strong ties to any given Network. The greatest burden is placed on the Verifier who would have to know how to resolve a DID on the Network from which the credential is issued. This applies to much more than just Indy.

The Hyperledger Aries project aims to bridge the gap between many networks by providing a generic "DID resolver" interface. Aries and Agents are under active development. A more in depth explanation of agents can be found here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0002-agents
</p>
<p><strong>jadhavajay</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 20:46:53 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @dbluhm for the explanation. I will check the details in Aries.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 20:56:13 GMT):<br/>
To this point (and others may need to correct me), I think schema definitions have organically been added according to the issuers' needs. Over time I think the vision is that, in similar fashion to establishing which DIDs are accepted issuers of credential X, trust frameworks will delineate what schema's ought to be used for a driver's license, passport, etc.

I also saw mention of some "Schema 2.0" work a little higher up in one of these channels. Would that also factor in to what we're trying to accomplish here? 

(.. and how would things like schema.org fit into all of this?)
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 14:44:53 GMT):<br/>
I'm probably not the best person to answer that question (@kenebert can give a better explanation) but Schema 2.0 is the effort for supporting more complex data structures in a way that still allows selective disclosure using zero knowledge proofs. Part of that is explicitly defining the data type of a schema attribute. I think schema overlays and schema 2.0 have a lot to say about the other but I haven't been involved in those conversations. I believe @kenebert, @pknowles and others meet regularly to discuss their work.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 14:46:30 GMT):<br/>
Schema 2.0 would allow usage of schema.org schemas? I'm really getting out of my area of expertise lol

Hi all, how can I get the schemas that are written on the ledger without having their id's? That is, if one entity writes a schema, how can another entity have access to it without knowing it's id?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:21:12 GMT):<br/>
@gsantos - discovery is not yet built into the ledger. Current solutions would be the following. For the Issuer to publish what credentials they are issuing (schema and credential defs) in some way (e.g. tell the other party).  Ledger browsers have been built that monitor the ledger, load the transactions into a database for discovery (this has been done a couple of times - this one https://indyscan.io/home/SOVRIN_MAINNET and this BC Gov one: https://sovrin-mainnet-browser.vonx.io/browse/domain). With these you can do searching.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:21:12 GMT):<br/>
@gsantos - discovery is not yet built into the ledger. Current solutions would be the following. For the Issuer to publish what credentials they are issuing (schema and credential defs) in some way (e.g. tell the other party).  Ledger browsers have been built that monitor the ledger, load the transactions into a database for discovery (this has been done a couple of times - this one https://indyscan.io/home/SOVRIN_MAINNET and this BC Gov one: https://sovrin-mainnet-browser.vonx.io/browse/domain). With these you can do searching.

In the future, I would expect there will be registries of schema and more ledger query tools for discovery.

Hi team, I would like to hear from your view about Microsoft's recently announced Identity Overlay Network (ION), which is using Sidetree protocol with bitcoin network as the trust anchor. Any comparison between Indy's approach and Sidetree's? Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:48:25 GMT):<br/>
yeah I saw that this morning, might be too early to have digested it though.  didn't it just drop today? https://news.slashdot.org/story/19/05/16/1926237/microsoft-launches-decentralized-identity-tool-on-bitcoin-blockchain
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:48:26 GMT):<br/>
One of the biggest difference to the two is that with ION you would have probablistic finality of the DID, where as with Indy you get deterministic finality. More realistically what this means is that if a DID gets updated during block X you should probably wait 6 blocks to make sure the changes don't get reorged out. There's only limited number of edge cases where this actually could be a concern. For the most part, you can trust it once it's hit the mempool. Another difference is that with a specific implementation of Indy (Sovrin) there's governance layers that exist on top that are more familiar to business organizations.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:50:26 GMT):<br/>
Some other difference is that Indy supports ZKPs out of the box, where as ION doesn't have support for this right now. I suspect someone will come around and build things like that in the future. The implications of this is that Indy can support issuing to holders that don't require an anchored DID.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:51:48 GMT):<br/>
Meaning if I want to get a credential as a holder, I would need to get a DID anchored to the ledger so that the issuer can issue to a specific credential. This is considered less private because it can become a globally correlatable identifier
</p>
<p><strong>kclinux</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:54:06 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @kdenhartog ! I don't mean to create big competition. But it's good if Hyperledger Indy (and Sovrin) can develop some material addressing this. It is some very important points that people should know.
</p>

That's an excellent concept but from my experience I see a number of deficiencies, especially in creating a schema that is extensible, discoverable and support multi-language.  Additionally, the conditional use statements as shown are very limiting.  I have a number of other concerns but suspect a lot of others really want to get down to the nitty-gritty of this.  I wonder what is the best avenue for a deeper & richer discussion?

@jwow Head over to #indy-semantics for a deeper discussion. All of the main ODCA contributors are members of that channel. There is also a fortnightly *Indy Semantics WG* call every other Tuesday for semantics development discussions.  The published *ODCA paper* only contains the basic elements of the architecture and the concept. There are a number of other parts that are already fairly strong conceptually that are not in the paper including Industry classification code tagging for data object searchability and personal data processing/consent association to published schema families. ODCA has been in constant development by members of the community for over a year now so the conceptual architecture is fairly mature now. ODCA really deserves a book rather than a simple paper! :slight_smile:

As a verifier I can create a predicate and the prover can prove they have a hiddden attribute that satisfies it. A predicate allows (>,<, >=, <=) operations. Can I (as verifier) create some kind of predicate, more an expression at this point, where a prover must prove the sum of two hidden fields satisfies a predicate? (Or multiplication, subtraction etc), whilst maintaining all the guarantees you would hope for? e.g. the input values are unchanged since issuance, no opportunity for the prover to fabricate the intermediate value without the corresponding (hidden) input values applied to the correct expression?

From what I can tell indy can't do this at the moment, My question is more how feasible is this? My thinking is it's incredibly hard as you're in the territory of secure multiparty computation. 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 16:13:57 GMT):<br/>
@EdCurran what is the semantic meaning of the two attributes being used? Is this in the context where two attributes represent monetary values and you want to prove the sum is greater than a threshold?

<p><strong>adamdossa</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 19:02:58 GMT):<br/>
I had a question about the Alice, Faber, Acme, Thift example. Faber & Acme need to have their DIDs / DID Documents recorded on the Indy ledger (since they are providing attestations about Alice which need to be verifiable) but do Alice and Thift bank need to have their DIDs stored on-chain? e.g. Alice needs to generate pairwise pseudononymous DIDs to establish secure connections with Faber & Acme, but I don't believe you need to store the DID on-chain to do this (Alice can contact Faber through their endpoint which is on-chain, and then establish a secure connection). However in the example it looks like Alice's DIDs are stored on the Indy ledger. Is anyone able to clarify this?
</p>
<p><strong>mgbailey</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 19:29:24 GMT):<br/>
You are correct. Pairwise DIDs do not need to be stored on the ledger. More current implementations only share the DIDs between the connecting parties, which are responsible for storing them.

Okay let's use subtraction. If I'm a lender that gives loans I want to perform an affordability calculation. I want to know income - expentiure is greater than the required monthly payments. In the spirit of selective disclosure can I do this without revealing exact income and expenditure (no i can't at the moment)

This type of proof would be possible with the changes we are proposing for 2.0. The feature would probably go in 2.1. Cryptographically this is possible and not too difficult

<p><strong>EdCurran</strong> (Sat, 25 May 2019 15:01:59 GMT):<br/>
I think it would be very useful.

What I think would be really cool is to create an evaluator for FEEL (see DMN: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_Model_and_Notation) that can be run against verifiable credentials. Including being run over hidden attributes on the provers end. From that you could execute DMN straight against credentials. You'd need some some kind of extra construct defining which issuers you accept credentials from within the DMN. Then bam easy repeatable decision making on trusted data. 

At the moment you could evaluate unary operators against hidden fields (which do make up a big chunk of use cases) but would have to run full expressions on the verifier side against fields revealed to you from the prover.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Sat, 25 May 2019 15:10:15 GMT):<br/>
Yes the trust framework would define the acceptable issuers. I’ve put this feature in for 2.1

<p><strong>Diiaablo95</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 06:20:29 GMT):<br/>
Hey people! A new question (I am working with Indy and underlying concepts in my M.Sc. thesis).* Is it possible to use ZKP with my identity provider, without revealing my identity?* I mean, can I prove that I am a member of that "club", for instance, without revealing what my identity is? So that I do not need to generate a new DID everytime I interact with my identity provider? Thanks! 🙂
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 06:36:35 GMT):<br/>
yes it is possible to prove possession of a credential without revealing it's data. Also, What do you mean by "do not need to generate a new DID everytime..."?
</p>
<p><strong>Diiaablo95</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 07:00:39 GMT):<br/>
I mean exactlty that. If somehow a ZKP presented to my issuer leaks identity information, because he is my issues, then I would need to generate a new identity everytime I interact with it and link the proof to that identity instead of the original one, otherwise the issuer, also a verifier in this case, would be able to understand who I am independently from the ZKP.

</p>
<p><strong>Diiaablo95</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 07:03:14 GMT):<br/>
I am just trying to solve this small bit, because when I told my advisor that a ZKP can be presented to the original issuer, it does not leak any information about the credential and the original DID it was issued to. But he said it was not true, and that for ZKPs to work you have to have of course the credential, but also to generate everytime a new DID so that you can present the ZKP with that DID and not the original one. And I started experiencing and existential crisis :sob: 
</p>
<p><strong>EdCurran</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 09:05:58 GMT):<br/>
Yes please that would be great, thank you.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 12:09:29 GMT):<br/>
First off, issuers know to whom the credential is issued. They are attesting to that fact by agreeing to sign some attributes about them. We use what’s called a link secret to bind the credentials together so the holder can prove all of them belong to the same identity. This is never revealed to anyone so even if an issuer is compromised then you don’t have to change it. The link secret is blinded before the issuer signs it. During a proof this value also stays hidden and to a verifier it looks like a different presentation every time because proofs have randomness to them. For example, if the verifier just asked to prove they are a member of the group and nothing else, then they don’t learn anything else. That’s what’s zero knowledge means. The verifier has a very low chance of correlating you. Now if you reveal your name then correlation risks rise a lot. The point is you don’t need to change information for a value that nobody knows if the issuer is compromised. Indy doesn’t typically issue credentials to a DID, it’s to a link secret. That way holders can use the credentials across DIDs.

Another piece of information that does leak during a proof presentation is who the issuers are because, the verifier needs to know which public keys to use for verification and which revocation registries to check.

<p><strong>Diiaablo95</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 20:06:20 GMT):<br/>
Yes of course the issuer must know who it is issuing a credential to. My question concerns the next steps. If I get credential A for my DID did:sovrin:abcd, can I then create zero-knowledge proofs regarding that credential and present them to the issuer, acting as verifier, without revealing what my DID is? Because my next question would then be how can I actually present a proof without leaking my DID in a DID-based communication system such as Indy? Should I use an external communication infrastructure that does not rely on DIDs? What about a Tor network then, since typical internet-based communication leaks other type of information such as IP addresses and MAC addresses? I might have come up with a way to use ZKPs without generating new DIDs, and it relies on being able to communicate with the verifier-issuer using HTTPS (only verifier authenticates itself) over Tor network, so that proof requests and proofs are part of the HTTP header or body payloads. Does it make sense? :D
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 20:38:38 GMT):<br/>
In Indy ecosystem, you have a pairwise DID to talk to each party. This makes them contextual. You do not have to use DIDs at all but they certainly help. You can do anonymous credentials without DIDs as I was saying. You can prove the link secret without revealing it each time to a verifier and to them it will look like a different person each interaction. To correlate you, they would have to use other means like behavior patterns or metadata.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 20:39:13 GMT):<br/>
If the verifier allows it, you could communicate with them over Tor and use another discovery mechanism than DIDs. Its up to you
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 20:53:29 GMT):<br/>
@Diiaablo95 - in Indy DIDs and credentials are (mostly) separate.  The only DID involved in a credential exchange is the DID of the issuer must be public and associated with an issued credential.  Other than that, DIDs are used strictly has (as Mike says, optional) communication channels, and in general are done with non-public (not on the ledger) pairwise DIDs. That is, for every relationship you have, you create a DID and give the associated DIDDoc directly to the other party and they do the same for you. The only purpose of that process is to give each other a secure, private channel to exchange messages.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 21:57:42 GMT):<br/>
The problem I believe @Diiaablo95 is highlighting is that if I get a credential issued to me using DID1 with Issuer1 and then I reuse the same DID so that Issuer1 can verify me at a later date, but rather than providing all attributes in the credential I only provide proof of possession. In this case when I provide proof later, If I use DID1 again, the issuer could correlate me by use of the DID.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 21:58:47 GMT):<br/>
However, if I create DID2 for the verification they wouldn't be able to. Furthermore, given that the DID2 has only been used for verification, it could be used again if you only wanted to provide proof of possession at a later verification time.
</p>

I don't think its a common use case. In today's world it's called having two logins to one service. You can do that with Indy as well.  Don't know why you would but have at it.  I think the only important thing out of this is the separation of DIDs and Credentials - the comms channel is not tied to the credential.

I agree it's not common at this point. Given we trust the issuer to issue a credential, I'm not sure how valuable reducing the correlation would be for something like that. However, it's possible to resolve by creating only 1 new DID for verification.

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 22:08:50 GMT):<br/>
First of all, you’re forgetting that the DIDs can be blinded before being signed therefore no correlation from that will happen. Correlation will happen via other methods
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 28 May 2019 22:57:39 GMT):<br/>
Can you explain what you mean? What I mean is if I setup a channel for communication to receive a credential and then reuse that channel to verify the credential the DID is a point of correlation as I understand it.

Hey! 
I have one doubt take a scenario in which: 
Alice has the credentials from Faber college(which is digitally signed by Faber college to proof their Identity) according to the transcript schema, let say college provide the required 5 values, and after getting credential it stored in the wallet, some times later Alice is applying for a new job and have to provide her educational proof, so Can she use same credentials provided by Faber college earlier? If yes, let say she wants to provide only 3 values (in her credentials there are 5 values currently) so how can she hide 2 values? If she tries to hide the data, the total hash value will change, which shows tamper with data.
Please provide some light in this area.

Hello guys ! 
I have a question on indy basically indy-cli.  Is it possible to send transaction on ledger for example if I have scenario of Alice and School so is it possible to send a transaction on Alice ledger that alice has been student of school since 7years through School ?

There is no hash. We signatures that support hiding attributes and selective disclosure. CL sigs is what is currently in Indy but we plan to add BBS+ and/or Pointcheval-Saunders.

Hey guys! Thanks all, these are all valuable and interesting inputs. My main point, as keen… was pointing out, is that DIDs in Indy are mainly used as communication channels, and hence are susceptible to the same information leak that takes place if you use the same IP address over time. No matter what info you are sending, if you use the same IP address all the different requests are linked to you as, for instance, 10.20.30.40. Now, I do not fully understand the question of a second DID for verification, especially who should create it and who should interact with it. The main reason why I am asking this question is that we have a pilot project in which we have a fleet manager and a series of electric vehicles. Upon registration, electric vehicles need to get a credential for the fleet manager saying that they are indeed customers of that fleet manager. At a later stage, whenever an electric vehicle goes to a charging station to charge, they would like to get an authorization token from the fleet manager service, and in order to do so they have to prove they are customers. Revealing the DID or somehow correlating that would make it possible for the fleet manager to (approximately) know the location of the electric vehicles, that is why de-correlation is possible. Always using new DIDs means that a new connection with the fleet manager must be established every time, and this can be time consuming. So what I would like to do is to get the initial credential from the fleet manager (the DID is not even relevant, but I honestly didn’t know it could be blinded), and after that be able, every time I need to charge my car at a charging station, proving to the fleet manager my membership in order to get the authorization token to charge my car. So how could it be prevented to correlate and de-anonymize the driver?

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 13:56:27 GMT):<br/>
So I believe there is a disconnect between what you understand of Indy and anonymous credentials.I’ll attempt help with that. DIDs can’t be correlated directly because the idea is they are pairwise. Establishing new connections is cheap. I just create a new DID and send it to another party. New connection done secure channel setup. Now comes the issue of trust. DIDs don’t establish that, they just make sure the channel is secure. What is nice about pairwise DIDs is that Bob knows Alice as DID "abc" and Charlie knows Alice as DID "def". Unless Charlie tells Bob that Alice is also known as "def", Bob would not be able to correlate Alice by DID alone. This makes DIDs contextual. This mimics the real world in the sense that you are known by different things in different contexts like with family you are a sibling, son, grandson and work you are an employee, boss, owner. Anonymous credentials help establish trust in those contexts. This is similar to meeting someone new in person. That's the easy part. But trusting that person doesn't come until you get to know more about them. To get to know someone digitally requires trustable credentials. The two parties can share as much information as they want and they both can verify it using Indy which until now could not be done outside of special deployments. Anonymous credentials are not issued to DIDs. They are issued to an identity that lives behind multiple DIDs. Alice can use her credentials to make proofs to multiple DID channels. When a holder wants to begin receiving credentials, the holder creates a link secret that is a random number always kept private. The link secret is blinded before the issuer signs it, so the issuer never knows the true value. Even if the holder goes to the same issuer, this number appears unique every time due to how the blinding is done. The issuer signs the value without knowing its true value, called a blinded signature. The remaining attributes are known to the issuer and signed as well. To make a proof, the holder must know every attribute value and the signature. The dislcosure proof, allows Alice to choose to reveal attributes while the remaining are kept hidden. The verifier receives a proof that hidden attributes exist and Alice knows what the signed values are. So for your example of a fleet, an electric vehicle could establish a new DID with each charging station. The credential could prove its a member of the fleet without revealing which member. The only thing the charging station learns is DID B arrived at HH:mm:SS on YYYY-MM-DD and proved to be a valid fleet member and stayed for 45 minutes to charge. That's it unless the proof description requires the vehicle to reveal more information like a fleet number or vehicle number. ZKPs are not perfect in that they eliminate correlation entirely but they enhance privacy where before they had to reveal everything or implement complex methods to perform selective disclosure.

Alice will be able to us the ZKP crypto that Indy credentials use to share only the values that any particular verifier needs to know. And Alice does not need to "hide any data" to do that. Selective disclosure is the primary reason that Indy (and now Aries) is using the ZKP format for verifiable credentials.

The *Blinding Identity Taxonomy* (BIT) aims to provide a needed common standards to help protect the privacy of _personally identifiable information_ (PII) about people, organizations, or things. Note that the current version of the BIT does not identify correlation patterns. That may be considered in future versions as correlation patterns emerge. 

The latest version of the BIT resides with Kantara Initiative’s _Consent & Information Sharing WG_. Here is a link to the latest version of the BIT ... https://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/infosharing/Blinding+Identity+Taxonomy

During this week’s *Hyperledger Indy Semantics WG* call, I put the spotlight on two contained elements that are integral to SSI that had been included in the taxonomy at the time of conception. Namely, …

- _Self-sovereign Key Identifiers_
- _Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs)_

Now that SSI technology is more mature, I believe that those elements can be removed and replaced by the following two elements …

- _Private keys / master keys_
- _Public keys / symmetric keys_

I had mentioned various DID types and DID Docs as potential BIT elements during the call but, on closer revision, I would suggest that only the above keys would actually constitute PII. 

I'm keen to hear people's thoughts of this.

</p>
<p><strong>Diiaablo95</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 08:21:29 GMT):<br/>
Hey @MALodder ! Thanks, this clarifies a bit more. The only fix is that every time the user does not talk to the charging station, which are not Indy-enabled, but to the same fleet manager that issued the initial DID and the relative credential stating that the user is a customer of that fleet manager. The charging station are only able to read and validate authorization tokens, which are obtained by the user on a per-charge basis, upon verification from its fleet manager that he/she is indeed a customer.
But anyways, you are saying that generating new DIDs is not time-consuming (this would happen on a recent mobile device). So how would the new connection be established in this way? Is there need for a dynamic QRCode (for instance) generated by the charging station that would allow the user to create the connection with the fleet manager? Otherwise, again, downloading a connection request from the fleet manager website, for instance, would allow the fleet manager to track which user DID created which connection with which fleet manager DID, bringing some correlation attacks, isn’t that correct? And after connection establishment, basically the fleet manager would publish a proof request and then the usual flow takes place, right?

Connections can be created however you want but they don’t require the fleet managers knowledge. QR codes are just one method. Basically the car creates connections with whoever it’s owner wants it can do any proofs it wants without any involvement from the fleet manager. Once the fleet manager issues the credential, there is no need to talk to him any more

I am trying to build VCX on macOS  using manual steps mentioned in Url :
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/vcx

Referring to Section:  OSX
To build libvcx for OSX and iOS using scripts do the following steps --

I am able to execute steps from 1 to 8. 
For step 9. ./mac.06.libvcx.build.sh > mac.06.libvcx.build.sh.out 2>&1
After executing above command and checking mac.06.libvcx.build.sh.out

I get error :
 ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
          clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
          
error: aborting due to previous error
error: Could not compile `libvcx`.

So I ran mac.build.and.install.rust.tools.sh  script and executed all steps again But still I see the same error. 

Also In step 11.	 mentions a file “./mac.07.libvcx.prepare.ios.deps.sh” which doesn’t exist in macOS GitHub. 

Has anyone able to build VCX for macOSX and iOS ?

Hello, I've only recently been looking in to Indy the last few months. I am currently prototyping a multi-tenant agent. Are there any resources around proper wallet management ? Specifically, when is it appropriate to use the non_secrets portion of the wallet ? I've been looking at the example here -> https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent/blob/master/python/indy_sdk_utils.py and it seems to store a reverse index from the ver-key to the did in the non_secrets portion. When is it appropriate to do that vs storing metadata for each key ? Also are there conventions around metadata for public-did's, credentials, pairwise dids ? 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:01:14 GMT):<br/>
Good questions.  I believe the teams working on agents (e.g. indy-agent, indy-catalyst and I believe agent-framework) are all using non-secrets for storing relationship metadata and protocol state information in a similar way, but there has not been formal discussions on exactly what to store.  This will be necessary for portability (being able to pick up your data from one agent to another), so these discussions need to happen relatively soon.  @andrew.whitehead might want to weigh in here and add/correct anything here.

Yep, makes sense. I definitely want to make sure that the wallets we manage are portable. Also want to make sure we arent defeating the purpose of certain aspects of DKMS by storing information in 'non_secrets'
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:59:24 GMT):<br/>
Just as an aside, everything stored in the `non-secrets` is still encrypted, including the tags and types used to retrieve the data (with one exception of tags explicitly marked as not encrypted).

</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 17:02:21 GMT):<br/>
This might be a fairly silly question, but what is exactly the string called 'did' 
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 17:02:51 GMT):<br/>
My understanding is that the ver key is what is used to verify the possession of the corresponding private key
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 17:03:12 GMT):<br/>
Is the did purely just a random string that's used as an address, and the private key never really leaves the wallet ? 
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 17:03:34 GMT):<br/>
* or i should say it never is accessible outside the indy-sdk 
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 17:16:06 GMT):<br/>
You can read up on Decentralized Identifiers in the DID spec. The abstract gives a pretty good, short description of what a DID is and why it's needed: https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 17:19:12 GMT):<br/>
A simple/incomplete answer would be that a DID allows someone to maintain a digital identity through key rotations and such while also providing a spec and a method for resolving DIDs on a ledger
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 17:20:44 GMT):<br/>
Yep, i think i understand that portion
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 17:20:58 GMT):<br/>
So basically a did - allows you to query the blockchain for a ver key 
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 17:21:19 GMT):<br/>
and verify when things are signed by the corresponding private key 
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 17:21:44 GMT):<br/>
but when i do a list_my_dids_with_meta
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 17:21:49 GMT):<br/>
and see something like ```        {
            "metadata": null,
            "tempVerkey": null,
            "verkey": "HZEhH8inNyY25EwqHEDfKqoY5BeSL7mP4QzqgAQcRnPf",
            "did": "XNntkYo6mtciW2ZsgRrJ37"```
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 17:22:02 GMT):<br/>
is that string "did" a private key ? 
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 17:24:34 GMT):<br/>
No, it is essentially just a random string that identifies the verkey, as you already seem to have figured out :slight_smile: 

On create_and_store_my_did, the DID is usually just the first 16 bytes (might need to verify that though it's not a super important detail) of the generated verkey
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 17:24:55 GMT):<br/>
But after key rotations and such, that can change
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 17:25:14 GMT):<br/>
(Sorry, may have misunderstood your first question)

That is correct, the indy-sdk never exposes the private key

I was discussing with @lynn.bendixsen the new auth_rules functionality. If we haven't defined any custom auth_rules, and run a get_auth_rules, it doesn't return anything. Does that mean that the default auth_rules aren't treated the same as custom auth_rules? cc @ashcherbakov @Toktar @Artemkaaas

<p><strong>iamShashvat</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 18:52:22 GMT):<br/>
With Indy infrastructure, the service endpoint for a DID will point to an agent. what if someone get the link/IP of agent, Can he eavesdrop? Is there any precautions for that?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 18:53:00 GMT):<br/>
The messages are encrypted.
</p>
<p><strong>iamShashvat</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 19:05:59 GMT):<br/>
Apart from this is there any more way to secure services endpoints? 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 19:11:04 GMT):<br/>
That's a pretty deep question. Agents are just services (code), so all approaches to securing services apply. Messages are encrypted at the message protocol level, and so are not dependent on underlying transport. So basically, you have all of the existing mechanisms, plus encryption where the communicating parties have exchanged keys. 
</p>
<p><strong>iamShashvat</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 19:34:53 GMT):<br/>
Thank you! But still I have some doubt. Correct me if I am wrong, I'll elaborate: let say Alice and  Faber College establish the connecting using DID and Keys. Agents of Alice and Faber college makes a connection using keys.
Now by some source, I got the DID Document or we can say Indy ledger's data where I found Service endpoints: https://exp/api/123231/etcetc basically it is pointing to an Alice's Agent.
Dont you think If I have the link, I can access to the dycrypted data of their conversation?
------X-------X------
Possible answer-- The communication between the agents only decrypt by the private key, which Alice have in her Wallet, Is it correct?

P.S. I am not the cryptography expert, it might possible I am missing out some point, Please do correct me If I am wrong.
------X------X------

Also please tell me, Can anybody be access to my DID Document?
By any source, if somebody gets my DID Document, is there any problem ?

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 20:47:50 GMT):<br/>
You should be able to build an iOS app independent of using libVCX. You would have to make direct calls to the indySDK rather than using libVCX. If you want something quick to experiment with take a look at https://github.com/mattrglobal/osma which doesn't use VCX or https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/connector-app/ which does. Some other options may be listed here https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent

Each agent independently controls their own key. These keys are used to encrypt messages for specific agents.   If the message that is encrypted for Alice's agent possesses one of the keys then she can decrypt the message sent to her endpoint. Let's say Bob messes up and sends a message to Alice's endpoint but doesn't include her key. Then in that case Alice cannot decrypt the message just like everyone inbetween Alice and Bob (think network providers like ISPs) cannot decrypt the message.

These gets more into Agents and how they managed, but the "endpoint" in the DID is not going to be directly to Alice, but rather to an Agency operated by someone ("Agents-R-Us") that do that on behalf of many Alices.  Using the "DIDComm" protocols, the Agency will know how to route the message to Alice. It works a lot like the post office - put the letter in a postbox and through a series of steps it gets to Alice's front door. Those in between can't see what's in the envelope (or even the final destination). They can just see enough to pass it along the next step.

Yes, the core message is encrypted based on a private key held by Alice.

Anyone can see a public DIDDocument (e.g. one on a ledger), so no problem with that. There are also private DIDs shared between two parts (Alice and Faber) and while unlikely anyone could get to those DIDDocs. Worst case would be them taking over someone's wallet and pretending to be them, but there are ways to protect against that. Again - lots of details once you get into it. Too much for rocketchat.

I work on mac normally, so I'm not always as familiar with the Windows based approaches. I can tell you with certainty though that it has something to do with how the IndySDK is finding the nodes and what IP the nodes are running on.

@kdenhartog , Why do I need agent framework for building iOS/ android mobile app? If required which agent framework can be used for iOS and android ?  
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 06:24:19 GMT):<br/>
you don't consuming IndySDK directly works just as well. In terms of why you might want to consider something like it though would be to get quick support of protocols that other agents are supporting. However, if you want to write your own protocol stuff over time using the SDK that works just as well. Are you looking to build a native iOS app or use something like react native?

built react native app for iOS and android. thanks for clearing the doubt. Not finding  a good documentation to use libindy methods directly . DO you have a good read?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 06:31:36 GMT):<br/>
The how-to guides help somewhat although they are somewhat outdated. E.g. they don't show how to use pack/unpack rather than authcrypt/anoncrypt. My suggestion would be if you go that route to try and build a library independent of the app itself that handles the API calls. Then consume the library in the app. That was the thinking behind AgentFramework and libVCX because the IndySDK calls are fairly primitive compared to what makes sense in an agent. I assume you would get a few people willing to help on the library/framework if you went that route given the plethora of people who work with js.
</p>
<p><strong>ptab-pawan</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 06:44:20 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog : So you mean I cant write a JS bridging class that exposes indy calls to react native ? was referring to :https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/IS-975 
</p>
<p><strong>ptab-pawan</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 06:47:13 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog : I am not very clear on  how I can consume  libIndy directly. Can you please connect me to few people who can help here ? We have built a webDapp  for SSI with Indy Node.JS . So the next step  is to develop a mobile app which will communicate with webDapp. 
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 07:36:43 GMT):<br/>
Essentially what you would do is write a JS library that consumes the JS wrapper of IndySDK. Then you would consume that library in your react native app and your webDapp. 
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 07:46:11 GMT):<br/>
So for example one of the API calls in the JS library would be create connection. In the AgentFramework this is how they do it: https://github.com/streetcred-id/agent-framework/blob/2ad84bca8877d00d23356f970891178220446533/src/AgentFramework.Core/Contracts/IConnectionService.cs#L41

@kdenhartog : As a first approach I had tried installing the npm module for Node SDK. But faced a lot of  issues  with bindings > binding.js library integrating  with react native. Couldnt get it working. So took second approach to try native iOS wrappers .
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 09:08:44 GMT):<br/>
In that case you could do everything natively in the App. You'll end up rewriting a lot of code in the two of them. 
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 09:09:13 GMT):<br/>
If this is just PoC, then that won't be too big of a deal. If you're working on a production codebase, I'd suggest finding out how to get the JS stuff working.
</p>
<p><strong>ptab-pawan</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 09:18:20 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog : It would be more than a POC so need it to be flexible and easily maintainable with Indy new features. Will analyse how can I get VCX or NodeJS working. As implementing  agent framework would be writing all code as you explained.

hi everyone, sorry if this isn't a good place to ask, there was a Sovrin meet-up in London 10 days ago (https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/sovrin-london-meetup-3-tickets-60808777691) I was wondering if anyone went and what came out of it
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>pknowles</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 13:27:21 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Diiaablo95</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 13:27:33 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder I agree with you there's no need to, but the use case requires the user to ask for a token to its fleet manager every time he needs to charge. And in order to get the token, he needs to prove to the manager that he is a customer. Hence, everytime the user needs to create a connection witht the fleet manager and then send to proof over such connection?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 13:55:06 GMT):<br/>
To clear up a confusion with terminology, creating a connection in this space means to establish a new relationship with another party. When you say create a connection I believe you are meaning the user communicates with the fleet manager to get the token.

So with that in mind, the user does not need to create a new connection but communicates with the fleet manager when he needs a token. Indeed he'll just send a proof that he's a customer and that's it. Now, if you don't want the fleet manager to have any correlation whatsoever, you do not have to this over a DID connection and can be completely anonymous. However, there is nothing that guarantees no one has tampered with the messages. Say Alice is a customer and Bob is the fleet manager. Alice can send a valid proof to Bob but without a DID connection, Mallory can change the proof to another valid one without Alice or Bob knowing. Alice's proof could be valid but Mallory sends another proof for a revoked customer. Bob won't be able to tell the difference. With a DID, Bob only knows that DID 'abc' sent a proof and needs a token. Small price to pay for security.
</p>
<p><strong>Diiaablo95</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:23:27 GMT):<br/>
Yes! That is exactly what I mean. Without the establishment of a new connection between a new, ephimeral DID from user's side and the fleet manager, there is no possiblity to reliably send a proof. Exactly. That is why I was thinking to use HTTPS over Tor to achieve such functionality. In this way there is no need to create a new connection each time, but still all the guarantees offered by both Tor and HTTPS are available. Now my work could also be a performance comparison between the two options, but I think I should choose only one otherwise it would take too much resources.
</p>

<p><strong>Diiaablo95</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:28:31 GMT):<br/>
I also think HTTP would be too much overhead and the entire thing could be implemented at a lower level in the stack, like a secure TCP connection or using zeromq, but I do not anything about those.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:29:29 GMT):<br/>
Ephemeral connections are not hard to create and can be done without DIDs. HTTPS isn't usually too heavy but would require each hop to have a Certificate and be protected by TLS
</p>
<p><strong>axel</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:31:00 GMT):<br/>
thanks a lot!
</p>
<p><strong>Diiaablo95</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:31:59 GMT):<br/>
Could you point me to some resources showing the creation of ephimeral, privacy-preserving connections? I guess they would be using the _endpoint_ part of the verinym fleet manager DDO, right?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:34:00 GMT):<br/>
DDO is an old term and is now called a DID Doc. If you want ephemeral connections, don't bother with DIDs. You would basically do a key exchange and have authentication from the fleet manager end then send the proof
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:36:28 GMT):<br/>
There is an indy-hipe about ephemeral connections that Mattr has done and it has the concepts you are talking about.  Might help you - I'll find the link

<p><strong>Diiaablo95</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:41:44 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder that is actually a good point. My use case indeed would mostly require anoncreds and ZKPs rather than the whole Indy protocol. Surely Indy makes the entire thing easy, but there surely are libraries for just anoncreds and ZKPs. @swcurran thanks for the heads up! This means that I am not the only poor soul thinking about use cases like this :joy: 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:42:40 GMT):<br/>
Sure you can use indy-sdk to do anoncreds and ZKPs. 
</p>
<p><strong>Diiaablo95</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 14:43:29 GMT):<br/>

Are there open source connectors to Active directory/ LDAP/ Open ID Connect-Oauth from Indy? Do you have any github references to these?
I know that "Legacy systems" are anathema and DID based solutions are the new way, we do need an adoption ramp as we bring these solutions to the Enterprise.
Any response on this would be appreciated.

<p><strong>Diiaablo95</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 16:46:22 GMT):<br/>
So, technically there is no need to create new connections each time, if users need to interact with the public identity of the fleet manager, right? I mean, users can just create a new DID every time, without creating any pairwise, and authcrypt with their single-use DID and the fleet manager public DID. What would be the the security implications of that? If we assume the fleet manager rotates the keys associated with its verinym on a regular basis?

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 16:49:05 GMT):<br/>
What you want is anoncrypt. Yes you can anoncrypt to the fleet managers public DID. The implication is controlling spam to the fleet manager as he cannot tell you is sending the message. This is usually managed by some proof of work like a captcha. Otherwise you establish a connection so the fleet manager knows who sent the message like from DID "abc".

I am trying to validate a person's DID is on the ledger before storing into a wallet, however, it seems when calling `did.key_for_did` the DID gets stored because when I call `did.store_their_did` I get Wallet item already exist error. Is validating a DID before storing the wrong way to go about it?

I did: docker network create --subnet 10.0.0.0/8 indy_pool_network
docker build --build-arg pool_ip=10.0.0.2 -f ci/indy-pool.dockerfile -t indy_pool .
docker run -d --ip="10.0.0.2" --net=indy_pool_network indy_pool

This might help but also it might be that individual creation doesn't include those IPs so it errors and uses the default

thanks I'll try it out

</p>
<p><strong>wang305305</strong> (Mon, 03 Jun 2019 20:45:09 GMT):<br/>
I did this:

<p><strong>wang305305</strong> (Mon, 03 Jun 2019 20:45:10 GMT):<br/>
RUN generate_indy_pool_transactions --nodes 4 --clients 5 --nodeNum 1 --ips="$pool_ip,$pool_ip,$pool_ip,$pool_ip"

RUN generate_indy_pool_transactions --nodes 4 --clients 5 --nodeNum 3 --ips="$pool_ip,$pool_ip,$pool_ip,$pool_ip"
RUN generate_indy_pool_transactions --nodes 4 --clients 5 --nodeNum 4 --ips="$pool_ip,$pool_ip,$pool_ip,$pool_ip"
</p>
<p><strong>wang305305</strong> (Mon, 03 Jun 2019 20:45:20 GMT):<br/>
still no luck
</p>
<p><strong>wang305305</strong> (Mon, 03 Jun 2019 20:45:44 GMT):<br/>
pool.txn still has the wrong IP 
</p>
<p><strong>wang305305</strong> (Mon, 03 Jun 2019 20:46:16 GMT):<br/>

What is currently seen as the standard for onboarding new users ? The method described in the HIPE here -> https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/master/text/0031-connection-protocol/README.md, looks similar to what is implemented in the indy-agent. However the getting started guide (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/samples/python/src/getting_started.py) show's a much less sophisticated method of creating pairwise did's. It involves writing the pairwise did's to the ledger, and much smaller messages. 
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Tue, 04 Jun 2019 02:51:26 GMT):<br/>
Hi @luckycharms810,

The getting started guide as it currently stands is outdated. We are working to update it to the most current connection protocol as defined in the HIPE that you linked. We no longer write pairwise DID's to the ledger, which minimizes our write transactions and preserves confidentiality for peer to peer communication. 

There is more explanation on this communication protocol in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0028-wire-message-format as well. Does that answer your question? 


</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Tue, 04 Jun 2019 03:03:40 GMT):<br/>
Yep, that is quite helpful! Is there anything preventing users from using the old style of pairwise did's on the chain apart from cost ? 
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Tue, 04 Jun 2019 03:05:05 GMT):<br/>
My understanding is that the changes are only in the protocol, but there arent any changes in indy-node that would prevent the additional nym transactions ?

Hello, does anyone know how to go about linking HL Fabric with HL Indy? I found this project https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Extending+HL+Fabric+for+connecting+with+HL+Indy and it states that writing your own custom MSP is the solution, but I have no idea how to write my own MSP. Can anybody help point me in the right direction? Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 04 Jun 2019 14:08:22 GMT):<br/>
Nothing to prevent that, but is discouraged.  Either you are using the DID pairwise only but sharing it with the world, or you are using the same DID for many users - which you don't want to do for connections. So you are paying for the DIDs to be public and not getting any benefit.

Hello, does anyone know when I call DidSigner(seed=b'000000000000000000000000Trustee1') and create_and_store_my_did(seed="the hex seed from DidSigner"), I got the same "did" but different verkey?
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 19:11:30 GMT):<br/>
Ah okay, so I guess this is using some sort of multiplicative homomorphic property ? 
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 19:12:40 GMT):<br/>
I guess the part of implementation that has been more relevant to my question is a more general question about the SDK
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 19:12:54 GMT):<br/>
In the python version of the SDK, there seems to be a lot of parameters that are JSON dumped strings
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 19:13:11 GMT):<br/>
Generally these seem to contain path's to files. 
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 19:14:13 GMT):<br/>
I find that this style has kind of narrowed down ways in which to implement a wrapper, especially because I cant just pass the SDK some file handles instead. 
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 19:14:35 GMT):<br/>
Is there some sort of work around for this ?

Sorry - been offline for a bit.  Stephen Klump is the best person to ask about that - he's done the best implementation. With anoncreds 2.0, the revo. method will change, and that might change this.

Does anyone know where Indy's most current thinking on an open credential's exchange protocol is located? Are we pretty much following the book of the [W3C  verifiable credentials data model](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#use-cases-and-requirements), or are there significant differences?

@TelegramSam thank you!
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Sun, 09 Jun 2019 19:37:47 GMT):<br/>
FYI, there is no W3C verifiable credential exchange protocol. It's explicitly out-of-scope for the  W3C Verifiable Claims Working Group. So different developer communities are creating defacto protocols. In this community it's the Aries RFCs that @TelegramSam pointed you to.
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Sun, 09 Jun 2019 19:47:26 GMT):<br/>
That makes sense. I suppose my second question should have been: Has the Indy community decided to format our credentials with the W3C data model, or is that out of the scope of the Indy project to specify?
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Sun, 09 Jun 2019 19:49:28 GMT):<br/>
So first let me clarify that the portion of the "Indy community" working on credentials is now the "Aries community". Secondly, I believe the answer to conference with the W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model is yes, but specifically with the ZKP format. @brentzundel is the expert on the details.
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Sun, 09 Jun 2019 19:52:53 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, @drummondreed. I'll suppose I'll go pick on other channels for a bit :) 
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Sun, 09 Jun 2019 19:55:07 GMT):<br/>
I haven't attended a WG call in a bit. From what I understand, Indy is now focused primarily on the distributed ledger portion (plenum, node, etc) and the "client" side work (sdk, agent, etc) is now part of Aries? 
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Sun, 09 Jun 2019 19:56:31 GMT):<br/>
Yes. An easy way to put it is the in the four-layer SSI architecture diagram (Appendix D of the Sovrin Glossary), Indy now covers layer 1 and Aries layers 2 and 3. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gfIz5TT0cNp2kxGMLFXr19x1uoZsruUe_0glHst2fZ8/edit?pli=1#heading=h.n5k2u6fkhf74

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 09 Jun 2019 21:54:58 GMT):<br/>
@mboyd - there is a mix of contexts in that question.  W3C doesn't talk about exchange protocols, just about the data model, so there is no "following the book" wrt to W3C credentials.

Currently, there is some hope that the W3C data model will include elements to support ZKPs and the Indy approach to revocation, but it's not clear that will happen. Time is getting very short in the current cycle and I'm not feeling particuarly optimistic that there will be time to get those into the this pass of the W3C credentials data model.

Currently, there is some hope that the W3C data model will include elements to support ZKPs and the Indy approach to revocation, but it's not clear that will happen. However, time is getting very short in the current cycle and I'm not feeling particuarly optimistic that there will be time to get those into the this pass of the W3C credentials data model.

Hello. Where can I find technical paper on Hyperledger Indy?
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 07:05:59 GMT):<br/>
Welcome. I'd read the [Indy Walkthrough](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/docs/getting-started/indy-walkthrough.md) first. It describes a potential use case that Indy can accomplish. Then I would peruse the documents in these two repositories to get a better understanding of our underlying concepts:
http://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/
https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/
</p>
<p><strong>Zohaib_Sohail</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 11:31:55 GMT):<br/>
can someone please tell me the difference between cred_schema and cred_definition and what's the need of both like can't we use just one of them by merging?
</p>
<p><strong>mboyd</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 13:15:14 GMT):<br/>
The short answer is that splitting up schema and credential_defs allow for better interoperable exchange and flexibility of credentials. A single schema can be used across multiple different organization's cred_defs to maximize reuse of the same data types. Multiple schemas could also be combined in one cred_def as well. 

You can learn more by reading [What goes on the ledger? (From Evernym, Sovrin Foundation)](https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/What-Goes-On-The-Ledger.pdf) for recent thinking on this.

During the creation of a new did, is there a way for me change the DID string ? I'd love to be able to specify the string itself, so that I can create DID's that can partially identify the Trust Anchors. ( For e.g. I've seen an example did that starts with -> sov:did:123456.... ) 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 15:03:16 GMT):<br/>
In theory, I believe that can be done - at least for pariwise-DIDs (not sure what indy-node enforces).  However, it is not considered as secure an approach.  You should check the did:peer method spec: https://dhh1128.github.io/peer-did-method-spec/index.html
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 15:41:04 GMT):<br/>
Ah, i guess I'm more interested in the Public did string. So this would be more specifically for a Trust Anchor's did. If i understand correctly, trust anchors that issue credentials will have a public did. They then introduce the credential transaction using that did, and folks can be assured when verifying the credentials that they were in-fact issued by the Trust Anchor.
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 15:41:23 GMT):<br/>
Does that make sense @swcurran  ? 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 15:46:04 GMT):<br/>
For folks to be assured about (aka trust) the issuer, they need to investigate the authority of the issuer to issue credentials. They don't care that the DID is called "Harvard University" - they find out from an authoratative source that Harvard is an Accredited University and Colleges as deemed by the US Government. They request verifiable credentials to find ones that assert who the is issuer. This can happen in various ways - here is a paper we wrote a long time ago about that: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nYq0iakgtyC21oUGWa5hLuJUoKeJFpURtGz6HcLIltY/edit
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 15:48:33 GMT):<br/>
Got it, yeah i think this would be more for the sake of convenience / for folks to gain some simple metadata by looking at the did. SInce the did string itself doesnt have any ties to the key I thought it might be a nice to have. 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 15:49:19 GMT):<br/>
That said - I believe in indy-sdk/indy-node, the DID must be derived from the initial verkey (public key) of the keypair. 
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 15:50:14 GMT):<br/>
Got it, makes sense. Thanks for a link to the paper!

Are there any thoughts around maintaining an 'issuance' registry rather than a revocation registry ? I'm only curious because if your wallet is compromised and someone issues creds on your behalf, there would be no way to know that it's happening. 
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 23:42:21 GMT):<br/>
I understand an issuance registry would need much more frequent updates, but if you are willing to accept a delay it could be done once a day or so.

@luckycharms810 On the issue of human-friendly names for DIDs, that subject has been discussed at great length at the Rebooting the Web of Trust conferences for the past four years. It's also mentioned directly in section 9.9 of the current W3C DID spec:

9.9 The Role of Human-Friendly Identifiers
DIDs achieve global uniqueness without the need for a central registration authority. This comes, however, at the cost of human memorability. The algorithms capable of generating globally unique identifiers automatically produce random strings of characters that have no human meaning. This demonstrates the axiom about identifiers known as Zooko's Triangle: "human-meaningful, decentralized, secure—pick any two".

There are of course many use cases where it is desirable to discover a DID when starting from a human-friendly identifier—a natural language name, a domain name, or a conventional address for a DID controller such as a mobile telephone number, email address, Twitter handle, or blog URL. However, the problem of mapping human-friendly identifiers to DIDs (and doing so in a way that can be verified and trusted) is out-of-scope for this specification.

Solutions to this problem (and there are many) should be defined in separate specifications that reference this specification. It is strongly recommended that such specifications carefully consider: (a) the numerous security attacks based on deceiving users about the true human-friendly identifier for a target entity, and (b) the privacy consequences of using human-friendly identifiers that are inherently correlatable, especially if they are globally unique.

</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 02:07:47 GMT):<br/>
There are specs under development to create cryptographically verifiable links from human-friendly names (e.g., DNS records, web pages) to DIDs and vice versa. Also, we anticipate that verifiable credentials will be used to verifiably assert the human-friendly name for a public DID. GLEIF, for example, is already working on this for businesses. https://www.gleif.org/
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 02:08:28 GMT):<br/>
And BC Gov's Orgbook project is setting up searchable, human-readable credential registries for finding businesses by any attribute in verifiable credentials for their business registration. https://vonx.io/ 
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 02:10:44 GMT):<br/>
Ah, that makes complete sense. Could definitely see how using a human friendly convention can lead to typo-squatting. 
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 02:15:41 GMT):<br/>
So basically there is a need for a sort of "yellow pages".
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 02:16:26 GMT):<br/>
Yes, a "yellow pages" is certainly one type of solution. To be clear, we (the DID community) are NOT trying to avoid the very challenging problem of mapping human-friendly names to DIDs. We are just trying to maintain the correct architectural layering of the solution, so that we can keep those hard issues of human-friendly naming at a separate layer from DID architecture. Credit goes to Christopher Allen (founder of Rebooting the Web of Trust) for that insight—and for sticking to it over the past four years. It has provided to be very wise.
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 02:20:26 GMT):<br/>
Understood, i guess having a verified credential of identity could be one method. Although that still requires some trusted party / quorum of parties to independently offer you identifying credentials. Very helpful nonetheless

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 14:01:35 GMT):<br/>
In Indy, the Holder/Prover provides the issuer with a blinded link secret that is embedded in the credential, and that enables the proof that the credential was issued to the holder.  That data is provided in the request_credential message/process.  As I understand it, the link secret in Indy uses a scheme based on a Pederson Commitment.  A Holder uses the same link secret for all the credentials that it holds, to show that when the claims from different credentials are proven together, they were all issued to the same entity.

please help me to get more knowledge on this
</p>
<p><strong>SethiSaab</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 06:40:02 GMT):<br/>

Suppose a DID document of a device is there

and this device also have verifiable credentials 


Now questions is ---->

What kind of service does a service end point of that device offers

and if a verifier has to check the authneticity of the device using service endpoint 

how will he because the verifiable credentials are already available and it can easily verify those by comparing signatures
</p>
<p><strong>SethiSaab</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 06:40:50 GMT):<br/>
what additional information we can get from service end point about authenticity of anything  even when we have verifiable credentials available for that

<p><strong>SethiSaab</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 06:42:41 GMT):<br/>
as of now there is no global schema  available ... suppose 2 devices are providing data to server  and they are using their own key words to define data like t for temprature
</p>
<p><strong>SethiSaab</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 06:43:10 GMT):<br/>
is it a good practice to put these kinds of details to the metadata associated with dids or endpoints
</p>
<p><strong>gnom1gnom</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 08:22:04 GMT):<br/>
Perhaps I haven't made myself clear. I want to understand how should I implement following two use cases:
1. An issuer gets 5$ for every credential issued. To get this 5$ he/she needs to prove to the payer that the credential was accepted by the holder.
2. Suppose the certificate issued to a holder is a proof that the issuer and the holder signed a contract with each other. Could it be that the acceptance of the certificate by the holder is a form of digital signature? Can the issuer request that the holder digitally signs a hash of the received certificate and sends it back to the issuer? Could it be a part of the certificate issuing protocol? And finally, is there any chance that the holder could revoke this certificate without the issuer acting on his behalf?

<p><strong>SeanBohan</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:35:05 GMT):<br/>
@AbhishekAadi  - Identity management can be done a lot of ways, with or without Hyperledger projects. Fabric has Fabric CA (https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/) or you could build something from scratch with Sawtooth or Iroha. Of the Hyperledger Frameworks, INDY was purpose-built for identity - not supply chain, remittances, track trace or other use cases. 
</p>
<p><strong>SeanBohan</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:46:24 GMT):<br/>
INDY does one thing savagely well: IDENTITY. It was purpose-built for identity use cases and designed with emerging open standards like DIDs, Verifiable Credentials, DKMS, etc. to make sure INDY can be interoperable with other decentralized identity systems regardless of what blockchain they are built on (Fabric, Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.). An INDY implementation could be public, permissioned or public/permissioned like the Sovrin DLT and provide identities for people, organizations and things. 

There are a number of integrations out there that use INDY as an identity layer integrated into a larger implementation: CORDA+INDY (Tieto & Luxsoft), FETCH+INDY (Anvil), even Fabric+INDY (Chris Ferriss @ IBM mentioned opportunities for INDY as a membership plugin at the Hyperledger Hackfest AMS last year. 

I am not an engineer, but if I was interviewing, I would ask the following questions:
Why is correlation-resistance important?
How is INDY Interoperable with other Decentralized Identity efforts?
How does revocation work within INDY?
Where are the open standards communities where INDY is engaged? (Decentralized Identity Foundation, W3C, Rebooting Web of Trust, Oasis)

<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Fri, 14 Jun 2019 12:47:33 GMT):<br/>
The DID DOC is not supported in Indy yet in the form described in https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/blob/master/spec/did-method-spec-template.html.
But this is on the Roadmap (this year).
However, as of now one can achieve DID DOC behavior when saving a DID with a public key (verkey) by NYM txn, and other metadata (like `endpoints`) by ATTRIB txn (using the `raw` version).

Hi everyOne,
I am new to the Indy. I have three queries while going through the indy walkthrough doc
1. At the beginning, while faber communicates with steward, why faber needs a different DID for verinym, it can use the same DID which faber used for connection request?. Any way faber doesn't share any private Keys to the steward right?. Generating new DID and keypair, increase the wallet memory , if we going for mobile app isn't it?. 
2. While sharing the proof, it is mentioned like acme raise the proof request and alice would share the credential for the proof. How this flow happening?. How alice knows that, she get the proof request?. Is the request directly comes to her wallet or is there any database is to store and process the request? 
3. Upon receiving the proof, what acme will do after verification?. Is acme store the alice credential in their wallet. If yes, can Alice able to restrict the access to her credential after it was shared?. 
</p>

Hi everyone, 
I want to add a new indy node to an existing network. I am using "bcgovimages/von-image:py35-1.6-8" this bcgov image. 
I added the pool_genesis and domain_genesis file to the new node. I generated keys for new node using init_indy_keys. But I am unable to join the new node to the network. I followed this documentation: https://indy-node.readthedocs.io/en/latest/add-node.html

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 15:06:00 GMT):<br/>
@BreizhIndy Indy's performance will depend hugely on how big the pool of validators is, how much RAM and compute power they have, and how fast their network connections are. Thus, there isn't a general "Indy performance" study. However, I know that the team that builds Indy does evaluate Indy in a specific configuration to guarantee acceptable performance before each release. They are trying to prove sustained reads of thousands of reads per second and >10 writes per second, with a validator pool of 25-ish, and they have consistently achieved those metrics. Less validators would increase write performance significantly. (10 writes per second sounds slow to me, although it is twice as fast as the global bitcoin network. However, Indy has a number of performance optimizations that are still teed up, that should easily allow this number to be 1-3 orders of magnitude faster when we need it. It just hasn't been a focus for now, partly because of how skewed traffic is toward reading.) The bottom line is that Indy's performance is predictable, and fast enough, for the use cases we have today. And it can be increased substantially when we need to.

@danielhardman Do you know from where i can get seed of steward DID to recover signing key ?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 15:18:19 GMT):<br/>
Seeds are never recorded by anybody but the steward themselves. So if you are talking about a steward DID that you created a long time ago, only you would have that seed. If you have lost a steward key, the steward identity will probably have to be abandoned and replaced with a new one. On the production network, this will be a bother; on the test networks, it will be easier.

If you are talking about where you can get a new seed for a new steward DID, I would use a secure random number generator (e.g., on java, java.security.SecureRandom) or similar.

</p>
<p><strong>BreizhIndy</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 15:44:32 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @danielhardman, I have to set up an experiment with 1000 wallet and different number of node. How can I evaluate red and write ? Do I have to send a big amount of transaction read/write and wait to see when it finish ?  
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 15:57:20 GMT):<br/>
Yes, you would have to simply time the transactions. However, i don't understand what you mean about 1000 wallets. Did you mean 1000 writes?

You could try contacting @ashcherbakov to see what script is being used by testers on his team.
</p>
<p><strong>BreizhIndy</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 16:10:00 GMT):<br/>
I mean simulate 1000 independent users exchanging credential, of course IRL they would not do the transactions at the exact same time, but I still need to check if it's possible
</p>
<p><strong>BreizhIndy</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 16:14:22 GMT):<br/>
There is multiple read and write per credentials exchange 
</p>
<p><strong>BreizhIndy</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 16:15:35 GMT):<br/>
to simplify my experiment I can maybe do for example: 1 university send 1000 "degree" credentials to the students who graduated from the university
</p>
<p><strong>BreizhIndy</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 16:15:43 GMT):<br/>
then try with 100 and 10000
</p>
<p><strong>BreizhIndy</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 16:16:00 GMT):<br/>
and with different number of nodes
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 16:42:10 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that should easily work well.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 16:45:40 GMT):<br/>
Exchanging credentials does not involve the ledger very much, though. Issuance doesn't require any write with each credential--only a write of the schema, cred def, and revocation registry that they all use. So you could issue 1000 or 10M credentials, and you still only have 3 ledger writes and no ledger reads (except maybe to populate a cache). When the credential is used to present proof, the verifier and the holder/prover each do a ledger read to check an accumulator value. These reads are likely to be cached for the holder, if they are proving regularly; in real usage, only the verifier's reads will probably have a linear correlation to ledger traffic.

No, the verifier can only show that someone proved something to him, no impersonation unlike full disclosure proofs which reveal even the signature then the verifier can impersonate. But not with indy

Aries will include the DID communication and wallet stuff from indy-sdk, plus additional functionality to support other blockchains. It will not include anything to run blockchains--only to use them. So indy-node will never move into Aries. If you are using indy-sdk today, keep using it, and in a few months it might be suitable to use aries-sdk instead. If you are trying to run an indy-blockchain, keep using indy-node; Aries will never replace that.

Farhan: If you added a steward to your network, you can do it one of two ways: with a seed or without a seed. If you did it with a seed, then the seed will appear on the commandline where you added that NYM, as a named arg, like so: "seed=xyz". If you did it without a seed, then there is no way to look it up.

That's related to a recent change that was made in Indy to handle multi-signature stuff. You may need to sign the transaction or you may need to reconfigure the network not to use multisig. This is a problem outside my current knowledge. I suggest that you contact @ashcherbakov  with your question.

Last question, do each DID have it's own signing key and saved in wallet to perform transaction? because i shouldn't be able use any DID to perform transaction on owner behave unless i have authentication keys to perform transaction.

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 19 Jun 2019 06:49:45 GMT):<br/>
I think this is a question to ask your local sysadmins or network admins. I believe that what's happening is that the code is attempting to verify the signature on some software, but your network may have access to keyserver.ubuntu.com blocked. There probably is a workaround, but I don't know it.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 19 Jun 2019 06:51:29 GMT):<br/>
Every DID has its own private+public keypair (also called the "signing key" and "verkey", respectively). All keypairs are stored in a wallet. In some of the getting started workflows, there is more than one actor (e.g., Faber, Thrift, Alice); each one will have its own wallet.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 19 Jun 2019 06:52:33 GMT):<br/>
Using a seed allows you to force a wallet on device 1 and a wallet on device 2 to contain the same keypair; if a command to create a DID and/or keypair uses the same seed, it ends up with the same keypair values.

I'm sorry I'm not more help. It's 1 am for me and this is a workflow I haven't done for a long time, so I think you'll be better off talking to someone who's more current and more on what it's doing.

@FarhanShafiq I don't see that anyone's answered this, so in brief: the Trust Anchor role was designed before there was a clear separation of Steward and Endorser. The goal is that Steward is defined as a specific role for operating an Indy validator node, and Endorser is a specific role for approving transactions on on the ledger. I believe (but do not know for sure) that the code is evolving to separate these roles.

Hi for Indy it seems that nothing much goes on the chain only (cred def, schema & revocation registry) and there is no chaincode hence what is the consensus mechanism for/doing? AFAIK consensus in other chains i.e. fabric is to make sure nothing is double spent after running the chaincode before sending to the orderer. Is Indy's consensus mechanism just ordering the blocks?

Can a user be issued with a credential of “You are 6ft tall and weigh 80kg”, and then create a proof (or rather verified presentation) from this that they weigh over 30kg and are over 4ft tall, with the specific number being kept confidential?

If this is currently working, is it restricted to range proofs, or can it do more sophisticated assertions?

Hi Daniel, Actually a verifier can only check globally the presentation proof of a prover. Actually a verifier can only state "this credential is not valid" without know "is invalid because revoked" or "is invalid because you have tampered it".  This info is very important in a business scenario.

Hello everyone! My question is about indy-agent. I wondering if there single protocol for indy-agent, or there are many different implementations of it (described https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent#known-agent-implementations). For instance https://github.com/evernym/connectathon-agent/ has different message format then indy-agent. So is there some standard way to communicate between indy actors which is supported by majority? Or indy-agent implementation is just an example how it can be done? Is indy-agent a production solution? And is it still under development/supported?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 28 Jun 2019 14:12:18 GMT):<br/>
We are getting to a single set of protocols - the ones in that table marked "Passed" work together.  Evernym was a pioneer in agents and have to do some retrofitting to get them aligned with the current protocols.  The discussions on the protocols are happening on the Wed. Aries calls and are documented in the aries-rfcs repo at Hyperledger.

A new agent that evolved from the `indy-catalyst` agent will be transferred to Hyperledger this coming Monday (or so) - `aries-cloudagent-python` - that implements many of the known protocols.  It is currently at `bcgov` with the same name.  More docs today and over the weekend.  It exposes a REST interface and uses webhooks to allow you to write a controller web app in whatever language you want to use to inject the business rules for an instance of the agent.

Hi community, i am learning about self soverign identity, decentralized idenfiers and hyperledger indy. First i started to learn specifications about these concepts. Now i have some question to ask. This platform has good community to find answers for my questions. But i like stackoverflow way to ask a question. I searched some questions about these subjects, i found a few questions. So i asked a question about DIDs and i need help. Could you answer my question. Here is link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56834159/does-decentralized-identifiers-cover-decentralized-pki

As some of you may know, indy packages have been having troubles installing and publishing this weekend. We found out this was an expired gpg key that prevented debian packages from being signed. We have now rotated the keys successfully, but there is an issue with ubuntu's keyserver not resolving the abbreviated key properly. To work around that issue, anyone wishing to install any indy packages on debian-based systems (including ubuntu) needs to run:
```
apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys CE7709D068DB5E88

```
We're sorry for any inconvenience and confusion this caused.
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Mon, 01 Jul 2019 23:28:37 GMT):<br/>
@Rick The short answer is yes. Also, the validator nodes ensure that any DID (NYM transaction) can only be entered once.
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Mon, 01 Jul 2019 23:32:24 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder or the other crypto gurus can answer this. Currently I believe it is restricted to range proofs, but the Hyperledger Ursa team is working on the second generation that will be more sophisticated.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 01 Jul 2019 23:33:53 GMT):<br/>
@drummondreed is correct. For it’s just range proofs but next iteration you can do range proofs and set membership tests. What other proofs would you do with height and weight?
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Mon, 01 Jul 2019 23:36:58 GMT):<br/>
So you are correct that Faber College will likely still keep a local database of the attributes it used to issue credentials. However Faber College does not have (and will never have) the private key used to *produce a proof* of those credentials after they are issued. Only the holder has that private key. Since with ZKP credentials, verifiers only ask for proofs, the value of the raw identity attributes is literally *drained away* by SSI architecture. The value is now in being able to produce the proofs...which requires the private keys...which is decentralized. And which should finally solve the honey pot issue for identity data.

Hi everyone. I'm trying to deploy the indy nodes in K8s. I'm using nodePort to forward the requests to the container nodes via the `32xxx` ports. I'm using minikube to run it locally. How do we customize the pool_genesis_transaction config so that we can use the nodePort, 32701-32708, instead of the default ports, 7901-7908, and send the transactions?  
</p>
<p><strong>n0rbs</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 07:38:20 GMT):<br/>
We've provisioned pods for each nodes (node1, node2, node3, node4) but after inspecting the pods, they seem can't to find the other nodes. Connection seems to be refused from the other nodes
</p>
<p><strong>Thomas_the_Consultant</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 09:24:08 GMT):<br/>
Interesting. I've been told by commercial organisation that this isn't yet implemented.

For now, we should be fine with range proofs for our purposes.
</p>
<p><strong>Thomas_the_Consultant</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 09:26:20 GMT):<br/>
If range-proofs are in the current implementation, then that's a big plus for our super secret business plans :)

<p><strong>ShrinivasDeshmukh</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 09:32:17 GMT):<br/>
Hi everyone, I have a question

The edge agent(mobile) will hold the wallet and all the data in it, and cloud agent will hold proofs, creds, etc data in it. As soon as any activity like cred issuance, etc happen on edge agent, this data should be pushed to the cloud agent (all sharable data). Is this the right approach? Can someone please suggest me the correct way of achieving it? 
</p>
<p><strong>Thomas_the_Consultant</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 10:01:13 GMT):<br/>
If we could work across matrixes of values, that would be great too...
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 10:18:44 GMT):<br/>
For now it's suggested that all proofs, credential data, and private keys are kept in edge wallets. Otherwise you're trusting that a cloud agent won't impersonate you and generate proofs or sign without your consent.
</p>
<p><strong>ShrinivasDeshmukh</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 10:46:57 GMT):<br/>
Ok! Thank you for the help! 
</p>
<p><strong>Thomas_the_Consultant</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 11:56:42 GMT):<br/>
Or summations, ex. normalised SAT score plus FICO score is greater than 0.9. That sort of thing...
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 12:32:09 GMT):<br/>
ZKPs aren’t meant to handle complex equations unless you’re willing to wait minutes to compute them in zero knowledge. Simple equations like the sum of two attributes is less than a threshold or the difference between two attributes are just fine

<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 16:25:57 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure which "commercial organization" you are referring to, but having a capability in Ursa or Indy SDK doesn't mean that it is exposed through all the layers in the application stack.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 16:26:02 GMT):<br/>
So you will want to confirm.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 16:27:10 GMT):<br/>
The range proof '>=' has always been supported. Ursa supports '<','<=','>' but I'm not sure if indy-sdk supports those three yet

<p><strong>Thomas_the_Consultant</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 18:16:45 GMT):<br/>
Ideally we'd like to be able to have a proof that the user's credential point is within a defined area in an arbitrarily dimensioned space. (It's a financial application.)

But '>=' gets us a long way already.

is hyperledger indy the same as Soverin Network, I am assuming they are related like Ethereum protocol is related to main net and ropsten, i.e. Soverin is an instantiation of the indy codebase / protocol ?
</p>
<p><strong>ramxis</strong> (Mon, 08 Jul 2019 10:12:09 GMT):<br/>
My second question is how does the Evernym product suite relates to the Soverin network, I am researching idenity solutions for a pilot project. So far I find the requirement of onboarding government agencies such as trust anchors or issuers as hugely problematic and a barrier for any project in the near future. My question is how can evernym product suite e.g. Verity, Verity:auth, Verity:Onboarding, and connect.me can help an organization wishing to use Soverin.

<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Mon, 08 Jul 2019 13:23:41 GMT):<br/>
Yes that is correct. Sovrin is one instance of an Indy distributed ledger and is governed by the Sovrin governance framework. 
</p>
<p><strong>Thomas_the_Consultant</strong> (Mon, 08 Jul 2019 14:00:52 GMT):<br/>
Sovrin is mainnet. Indy is the EVM. Evernym is the Redhat of Indy.

Verity and connect.me are commercial components built on Indy.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 08 Jul 2019 14:03:43 GMT):<br/>

Hey guys, I have recently started learning indy, and I have successfully recreated use case shared with link https://github.com/swcurran/education/tree/master/LFS171x/indy-material/nodejs 
I am now trying to replicate the above use case with 3 node agents from my use case. For this I need to change make changes in docker-compose.yaml with my server IP and Ports as I want to host these agents on my server and access these agents using those IP.
If I change the IP and ports and now and deploy the application stops working.
Could someone please guide here as to how to I can achieve this?
Thanks :)

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 11:09:25 GMT):<br/>
Hi @AmanAgrawal - I'm not able to help for a bit as I'm teaching an Indy course for the next couple of days.  I'm not quite clear what you are trying to do - just change the config so that the UI is visible on other machines?

 I would not recommend investing much time in that, if you are trying to do "real things" with Indy/Aries.  If you are just make a minor extension to it, that's fine, but if you want to go even deeper, you might look at the latest work being done in Aries.  There is a new guide that gets you coding in Aries that has just become available (link below).  It starts with the same content you have just looked at and goes from there.

</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 21:05:01 GMT):<br/>
Kinda, but the reaction has been a bit hyperbolic. In order for it to work, the app needs to open, so it's not really like the User is unaware of it. Plus the mac camera light still turns on.

Yes, there are various ways to approach including images and links in credentials. Probably best to ask that question in the #aries channel as that's now where agent/wallet work is happening.
</p>
<p><strong>drummondreed</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 06:57:20 GMT):<br/>
The easy answer is to include an expiration date as a claim in the credential, which would simply tell verifiers that it is no longer valid after that timestamp. By "not working", do you mean that the holder would no longer be able to even create a proof for it?

I'm trying to enable logging output from libindy like this `RUST_LOG=trace RUST_BACKTRACE=1 node src/myscript.js` but I'm not getting the hale of logging messages I'd expect 🤨 Am I missing something?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 12:21:55 GMT):<br/>
@Zohaib_Sohail - What was previously indy-catalyst agent is now aries-cloudagent-python and part of Hyperledger. https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python

Is that what you are looking for?  There is a Getting Started Guide in the readme, and there are some good labs/demos for learning in the `demo` folder.
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 12:41:47 GMT):<br/>
Ah no, I guess more that a holder would be able to create a proof that would stop working for the verifier after a certain amount of time. A sort of TTL for the created proof. 
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 12:42:30 GMT):<br/>
It would not so much have an impact on the credential itself, but the verifier's ability to check it.

@jljordan_bcgov  is there any node js based demo available? 
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 13:44:05 GMT):<br/>
Not a recent one 
</p>
<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 13:44:44 GMT):<br/>
There is one in the education course above ... however it is quite dated and likely to cause some confusion around the concepts of Peer DIDs and agent to agent messaging

Which are core to Aries / Indy based systems

The aries-cloudagent-python model is that you build a controller (your app) as a pair with an agent. The controller is like a webapp, can be in any language you want.  The agent sends HTTP events to the controller, and exposes an HTTP JSON API that the controller can call to control the agent. You put your business rules, UI, etc. into the controller.

 tried building indy-sdx on macOS

one of the rust dependencies would not build.  All the other rust dependencies built fine.
The error is in the issue. but reproduced here

I created a jira issuer for indy-sdk

@malodder.  I am on macOS   What version of SQLite should I be using or what are you using?
</p>

<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 21:23:27 GMT):<br/>
The default sqlite3 for macOS mojave is 3.24.  The latest homebrew install is 3.28. It installs keg only because of the conflict with the macos version. However I overrode the symlinks. as follows: 
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 21:24:48 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 21:26:09 GMT):<br/>
@malodder What version of sqlite3 are you using?
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 21:26:25 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder 
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 21:27:40 GMT):<br/>
Not sure if the others besides SQLITE3_LIB_DIR matter for rust build
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 22:03:10 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder I tried rustc 1.34 and it built without the error.  So how would you like it documented. I assume there is some compatiblity issue with rusqlite and the version of sqilite and rustc. Based on the error its an illegal trait definition that has crept in someplace.

Hi, I am trying to run the TheOrgBook using Docker compose, I followed the steps documented in https://github.com/bcgov/TheOrgBook/blob/master/docker/README.md.

<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Sat, 13 Jul 2019 16:14:53 GMT):<br/>
@andrew.whitehead   it is a problem with rusqlite 0.13.0 but I am using rustc 1.36.0 so the problem if it is the same one that was fixed before is not reocurring.
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Sat, 13 Jul 2019 16:19:05 GMT):<br/>
The error is a trait definition error conflict. I don't know rust so I don't know where to look to fix it.  I suspect that the error has nothing to do with the sqlite3 library version 1.34 etc but is a problem with rusqlite code itself and it is conflicting with something in the rustc library that rustc 1.36 introduced. Maybe tighter enforcement of the trait conflicts.
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Sat, 13 Jul 2019 16:24:39 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder I just tried building with rustc 1.35 and it built fine. So could you confirm by building with rustc 1.36 on your machine to see if you get the error?
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Sat, 13 Jul 2019 16:27:38 GMT):<br/>
It appears to be a new bug with rusqlite 0.13.0 and rustc stable 1.36
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Sat, 13 Jul 2019 16:28:06 GMT):<br/>
Sure I’ll try now

</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Sat, 13 Jul 2019 16:30:41 GMT):<br/>
so its a rust 1.36 incompatibility with rusqlite
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Sat, 13 Jul 2019 16:30:45 GMT):<br/>
What to do now with it?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Sat, 13 Jul 2019 16:30:57 GMT):<br/>
I would use rust 1.35
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Sat, 13 Jul 2019 16:31:28 GMT):<br/>
Should report it to rust?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Sat, 13 Jul 2019 16:31:29 GMT):<br/>
unless there is a rust 1.36 specific feature you are needing
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Sat, 13 Jul 2019 16:31:41 GMT):<br/>
no report it to the rusqlite crate owner
</p>
<p><strong>smithsamuelm</strong> (Sat, 13 Jul 2019 16:31:46 GMT):<br/>
No nothing that I know of.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Sat, 13 Jul 2019 16:32:04 GMT):<br/>

@mkdogan  downgrading rustc to 1.35 or 1.34 works. @malodder confirmed bug with 1.36. So its problem between  rustc 1.36 and rusqlite 0.13

Not sure if this is the right channel for this, but I found a really weird bug in the Indy python SDK when I used it w/ python3.6
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 20:05:28 GMT):<br/>
Basically I found that calling ```wallet.close_wallet(handle) ```, did not close any of the open file handles to the sqlite.db file, and furthermore they did not collapse the changes from the WAL file back in to the main file. 
</p>
<p><strong>luckycharms810</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 20:05:40 GMT):<br/>
I also noticed the -shm file also hangs around too.

Hello all, looking for an advice about which wrapper to choose. I know how to code in Java, Rust and Python (I don't mind learning a new) so I am wondering which one of Indy SDK's wrapper is the most "complete" and maintained (up to date with latest dev). Thanks!

Hi All, i am having problem in setting up the "python ref agent" in my AWS instance. I am running python 3.6. The docker build fails because of this: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'python_agent_utils'. I cannot find this missing module anywhere..Someone can help?

<p><strong>Thomas_the_Consultant</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 11:46:19 GMT):<br/>
Am I right in thinking that the way did:peer generally works is...
1. User Agent resolves DID of a credential issuer on Sovrin chain to an HTTPS end-point.
2. Introduces itself to the HTTPS end-point of the issuer, passing over a pair-wise DID whom's own end-point is the User Agent's Cloud Agent.
3. The response from the credential issuer is passed to the User's Cloud Agent using the A2A protocol (I presume that's what Zero MQ libs are there for). This response will be encrypted with Authcrypt and not readable to the Cloud Agent.
4. Cloud Agent will send a mobile push to the User Agent, or alternatively the User Agent will just poll to collect the response.
?

Sorry if this is basic, I'm just find that there's a wall of docs out there when I Google. Everything seems possible, somewhat less seems documented :)

The bigger question is why start with the indy-sdk. Depending on what you are doing, a more productive route is to build an agent based on Agent code - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python

Check out the Getting Started Guide link in that repo.

If anyone has any deployments either launched or ready to launch that have any sort of public-facing side, consider submitting them for an ID2020 Certification Mark - it's something I advised them on, and they're collecting an initial set of certified deployments to demonstrate its value.

Let's say, there is an application that uses decentralized identity mechanism to recognize the participants and it is a requirement that user wallet needs to be portable, then where does the cloud wallet (cloud agent) live in this case? 
I mean who hosts the individual user's cloud wallets?

Aries is an agent that runs on top of indy-sdk and can be used to implement applications.  Here is a "0 to coding" guide for Indy/Aries.

Do pairwise DIDs have DID documents in any meaningful way? And, if so, what should be in them?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 16:05:52 GMT):<br/>
Yes.  You can look at the did:peer spec (https://openssi.github.io/peer-did-method-spec/index.html) and specifically for DIDcomm, take a look at the RFC - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0067-didcomm-diddoc-conventions

Supposing I have a wallet (Streetcred/Connect.me) installed on a smart phone alongside the Faber University app...

I want the user to click a button on the Faber app, and then be switched into wallet to receive a Credential. The Faber App (which doesn't know the user's DID/public key etc) authenticates with a backend using a shared secret, the Faber Agent [having a DIDComm end-point and the ability to issue credentials] will need this shared secret to authenticate on the user's behalf and find out the grades for the credential.

What's the sensible way to do this? How do we generally pass cookies around to re-identify users between the HTTPS/REST and DIDComm/Indy world?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 23:31:23 GMT):<br/>
This has been discussed in a previous Aries (or Indy Agent call) that I missed.  If the user is on a desktop, a QR code can be used.  Doesn't work well on a phone :-).  As I recall, there are two options - a registered file type (or protocol??) handler that is associated with the Wallet app, or a deeplink to a specific app.  As I understand it, the problem with the deeplink is that it doesn't work across mobile eco-systems, or across apps - it is to a specific app.  So it seems like the "registered file type" seems to be the best approach, but I think there are problems with that as well.

Note that this isn't a DIDComm specific issue - it's any link in a mobile browser/mobile app that is expected to open a class of apps.  Further, you really want it to work such if you don't have any app of that class installed, the link triggers a way for you to install an app...

I think what you’re suggesting might be covered by the credential proposals covered here? https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0036-issue-credential/README.md
As to the QR code, in that case I think it would contain a presentation request? Although I’m not totally clear on the use case

> 2. Why is it writing to my log file ~8 times per minute (removing the same items over and over)?
This warning indicates that a Node can not send a Reply to a Remote with the given ID. There can be different reasons why Remote is removed: a Node has been demoted, Node's IP/port/keys have been changed, etc.
As for why it repeatedly logs this, it needs to be investigated. Can you please create a ticket and put a full log there with a description of the use case where it's reproduced? Additional information about changing the pool state will be very useful as well (for example whether some nodes have been demoted, etc.)
</p>
<p><strong>Thomas_the_Consultant</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 08:05:32 GMT):<br/>
Hmm, thinking about it, the ideal would be if I could pass an additional parameter to the Issuing Agent in the connection request.

So...

```
{
    "@type": "did:sov:BzCbsNYhMrjHiqZDTUASHg;spec/didexchange/1.0/invitation",
    "@id": "12345678900987654321",
    "label": "Alice",
    "recipientKeys": ["8HH5gYEeNc3z7PYXmd54d4x6qAfCNrqQqEB3nS7Zfu7K"],
    "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.com/endpoint",
    "routingKeys": ["8HH5gYEeNc3z7PYXmd54d4x6qAfCNrqQqEB3nS7Zfu7K"],
"some_bearer_token_I_hope_wont_break_the_validation": "133t_t0k3n"
}
```

And then `133t_t0k3n` can get pulled out by the issuing agent to work out who is making the request.

</p>
<p><strong>Thomas_the_Consultant</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 08:06:32 GMT):<br/>
Before I was allowed to talk to outside ppl, I was sent an email with 24-point red text telling me not to be clear about the use-case :) So apologise for the vagueness.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 08:07:16 GMT):<br/>
That's usually covered by the recipient key in a connection request, which can be tied to a specific connection invitation (which might have special privileges)
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 08:09:00 GMT):<br/>
I didn't know there was a welcome email with big red text now :)
</p>
<p><strong>Thomas_the_Consultant</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 08:13:52 GMT):<br/>
Doesn't the request key need to be the agent's public key? How do I add information to that?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 08:27:46 GMT):<br/>
That’s the sender key in this case 
</p>
<p><strong>Thomas_the_Consultant</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 10:57:47 GMT):<br/>
So where would I include `133t_t0k3n` in the connection request to ensure it's picked up and included in the exchange request?

In the service end-point URL?

Or is this completely the wrong way to think about it, and what I want to do is pass the `133t_t0k3n` to the Issuer out of band, who will then pass back a  private DID specifically for this client?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 18:22:47 GMT):<br/>
You don't need to include the extra token because you (the issuer) created the receipientKey and can use that to get back to the context of to whom you sent that invitation.  An example is the email verification service we (BC Gov) built. At the service, you put in your email, we send you an email with a link to an invitation. When you use that invitation to connect, we can associate that back to the email address you entered.  https://email-verification.vonx.io/
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 18:24:20 GMT):<br/>
It usually contains the invitation itself. It might be wrapped in a way to trigger your User Agent to process it in a certain way - e.g. to have it open a certain app to process the request.  For example, the invitation might be embedded in a URL.

Hi @mattatkiva, I don't know of any better documentation that what Kyle shared, but I can help with some samples as I have been doing quite a bit of auth_rules setting and testing on the Sovrin Foundation's BuilderNet. For example the auth_rule that I set for a privileged network was ```ledger auth-rule action=ADD field=role txn_type=NYM old_value=* constraint="{"constraint_id":"OR","auth_constraints":[{"sig_count":1,"role":"0","constraint_id":"ROLE","need_to_be_owner":false},{"sig_count":1,"role":"2","constraint_id":"ROLE","need_to_be_owner":false},{"sig_count":1,"role":"101","constraint_id":"ROLE","need_to_be_owner":false}]}"```  That command sets it up so that one signature that has role Trustee(0), Steward(2), OR Endorser(101) can add an unprivileged nym to the ledger(no role).  I can send a sample of what I used for a privileged ledger also (fees enabled) if that helps, or I can answer more questions that you might have.

I can send a sample of what I used for a privileged ledger also (fees enabled) if that helps, or I can answer more questions that you might have.

The implementation work for identity inside of Hyperledger has gotten to a point where there is a significant amount of cross-project collaboration.  In particular we have a lot of Indy+Aries+Ursa discussions about API surfaces, release planning and use cases that has always been going on in the Thursday Indy WG call.  Since the nature of that collaboration now spans multiple projects with the three we mentioned, we are moving that call underneath the Identity WG's management and officially opening it up to all Identity Implementation work (we didn't want it to distract from the higher-level whitepaper or use case work already going on in the bi-weekly call we have now).   So if you're writing identity code for a Hyperledger project, or anything that intends to be interoperable with a Hyperledger project, please join us for the first Identity Implementers call next Thursday at 9 AM mountain time.  We will be discussing whether to have the call every week or every other week, and looking for any other working groups from the projects that would like to report status or discuss progress.
</p>

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 18:49:10 GMT):<br/>
An observation:

While it definitely makes sense for combining the three projects into a single call, focusing the name on identity vs. the broader verifiable credentials/trusted data use cases is a bit limiting.  We spend a lot of energy pushing on the possibilities beyond identity.

Hi All, is there a way to continue with this Agent demo sending credentials? https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent/blob/master/python/README.md
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 11:48:17 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=z8mN7fzQoxpToQx2f) @lucafra I highly recommend you check out the aries-cloudagent-python repository and use that agent over the Python Indy reference agent. We haven't officially added notices to the indy-agent repo yet (we need to) but it has been superseded by the Aries project and most components in there have corresponding (and much improved) code in the Aries project.
</p>
<p><strong>ShrinivasDeshmukh</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 14:12:02 GMT):<br/>
Hi everyone, 
I am not getting exactly how will the edge agent and cloud agent will bind (or tunnel). What I am trying to implement is that the cloud agent will receive the message, check the format (protocol) and forward it to the edge agent. Edge agent will decrypt the message using his private key stored in his wallet. Is my understanding correct? Please  can someone help me with this?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 14:37:08 GMT):<br/>
In most cases, an edge agent will not have a persistent endpoint that the cloud agent can connect to at will; for example, a mobile phone does not have a consistent IP Address and a web server running, accepting POST requests. The edge agent must initiate the connection to the cloud agent in order for the cloud agent to deliver messages to the edge that it received on it's behalf. The edge agent alone holds the keys to decrypt the message, as you correctly pointed out. These are the kinds of discussions that are being held in the #aries channel which is the cross-ledger interoperable agents project Hyperledger Aries :slight_smile: 
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 14:38:22 GMT):<br/>
I also highly recommend you look into the aries-rfcs repository for more reading on agents and how they communicate: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs
</p>
<p><strong>ShrinivasDeshmukh</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 14:43:23 GMT):<br/>
Thank you @dbluhm. So the cloud agent will hold the messages until the edge initiates the connection. And once edge agent initiates the connection, all the queued message will be delivered to the edge agent at once right? And the connection has to be initiated by the edge agent only, since there cannot be persistent binding because of no static IP of the edge agent. Is this correct?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 14:58:14 GMT):<br/>
We've discussed a few ways this could be done. One way is the edge agent initiates the connection and the cloud agent bundles all queued messages into a single response, as you've described. Another way that could be beneficial for very simple agents (static agents, for instance, perhaps running on an IoT device) is the cloud agent responds with a single message each time but indicates that more messages are pending so the edge agent continues to post a message that triggers the sending of another message in the pending queue until the pending count reaches 0. This is described in detail in the [transport return route Aries RFC](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0092-transport-return-route). Another option is that the edge agent opens a WebSocket or other bidirectional transport to the cloud agent and all the messages could be transferred over the socket individually.
</p>
<p><strong>ShrinivasDeshmukh</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 15:06:41 GMT):<br/>
Thanks a lot! We'll proceed with the websockets implementation for now.!

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 15:28:31 GMT):<br/>
@ShrinivasDeshmukh - if you want to see an example of this, there is a demo "performance.py" in the aries-cloudagent-python `demo` folder.  See the docs for how to run it - you have to pass into the startup a third parameter set to True.  When you do that, the demo spins up three agents - Alice, Alice's routing agent and Faber.  Faber then issues and Alice receives 300 verifiable credentials and timing information is generated.  In the code you can see how Alice and her routing agent collaborate.

The demo readme shows only how to run the demo in default (Alice - Faber directly), but you can tweak the startup to add the third parameter.  Let me know if you have trouble with that and we can help.  The easiest way to just run it is to use the "In Your Browser" method in the readme.  As you get deeper into the code, you can use the "Running in Docker" approach, or if you really want - running locally.

FYI - the BC Gov team has initiated an open source project (via an open source "Code With Us" bounty) to implement a OpenIDConnect Identity Provider that works using Verifiable Credentials.  Mattr Global is doing the work with BC Gov.  The initial repo for the effort has been created and a first draft of a document that outlines many of the details of how it is going to work is in the repo.

Check it out here - https://github.com/bcgov/vc-authn-oidc. 

Please feel free to help with this effort - add issues, ask questions and add pull requests.  We're hoping to have something that can be easily used with any IAM in any deployment.

From what I understand, when the wallet is created there is a key for a wallet right. So what i want to know is where does this key is being stored ? is it inside the wallet DB or it is else where ? And another thing that I am confusing, does the credential has a key like a wallet ?

One more thing, when there is new credential issued by an issuer, then how does the credential is being recorded into the wallet ? like.. how the key-value pair is being recorded into each tables inside the wallet DB ?

There has been talk of integrating Indy and Fabric, but AFAIK there is not an implementation.  I'm curious as to whether you have an use cases in mind for integrating the two?  Is there a specific goal for having DIDs on the Fabric ledger?  I don't know that much about Fabric - just the main concepts at a high level.

Hi. Is only PostgreSQL is supported with Indy or Aries? If yes, why?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 17:56:31 GMT):<br/>
SQLite is also supported (it was the original) and Postgres added.  The database is pluggable so others can be added. Postgres was added because we (BC Gov) needed it.
</p>
<p><strong>RaviJha</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 18:01:49 GMT):<br/>
Only RDBMS type DB is supported, is it so?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 18:03:55 GMT):<br/>
You would have to look at the API to determine if other models could be used. I would not be surprised, but don't know.

The data model is very simple - key-value pairs for the most part. The only "tricky" part is the encryption and tagging.
</p>
<p><strong>RaviJha</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 18:10:15 GMT):<br/>
can we save multiple credentials on file system without any db?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 18:12:09 GMT):<br/>
If you want to do that, I would use the SQLite implementation. You need to have a database for querying and so on.

Not sure if this is the right place for this or if I should make an issue on the Jira board - I'm currently trying to create a revocation registry for a credential definition and I am getting a "CommonInvalidStructure" error. I am passing in the issuer's wallet handle and verinym, a null value for the revocDefType, a tag, an object with max_cred_num: 1 for the config, and a blobStorageHandle. Any advice?
</p>
<p><strong>StephenJackson</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 20:35:11 GMT):<br/>
Further context - I'm running the Indy SDK in an Express app inside of a Docker container, and something about this structure is making it so that the openBlobStorageWriter function isn't creating a tails folder and blob storage file when called. Trying to track down why, but I presume the issue is related to that.
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 23:05:22 GMT):<br/>
The error you are seeing is sometimes returned when one of your parameters is invalid, and it looks to me like revocDefType isn't supposed to be null. (I am not an expert, just googled around a bit and have seen that error for other calls...) ```revocDefType (enum string): Revocation Registry type (only CL_ACCUM is supported for now).```

As Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu, the packages built for Ubuntu may work but you will likely have to manually download them and install with `deb`. If that doesn't work, you will have to build from source for now.

Hi Fellow Community Members!

We, the folks from the BC gov VON (https://vonx.io) team, would like to share an opportunity with members of open communities to work with us to do some focused collaboration around mobile agent, Aries agents and aries-cloudagent-python interoperability. We have a pilot production service planned for a significant professional accreditation organization within our province coming up in the fall. This pilot has a requirement for mobile agents to be able to hold and offer verifiable credentials issued and verified by services operating instances of aries-cloudagent-python. Details are in this Open Collaboration MOU: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GPZ4p4zM36AN3DcHJ13s_IisSrT4F3S0 

More details around the use case and how we intend to work with the community are in the document.

Our offer is to work closely, in the open, with groups that we believe are close to having a releasable mobile agent such that their agent could be one of the listed compatible agents when this new service goes live. Our expectation is for the production pilot to occur this fall.

If you are interested and think you have a mobile agent that is close to release, please review this Open Collaboration MOU, and contact us via Hyperledger Rocket.Chat or via my email available in the MOU.

We would expect to have all participates identified with signed MOUs by Aug 6th 2019.

Hi all,
</p>
<p><strong>samurai</strong> (Wed, 24 Jul 2019 20:04:47 GMT):<br/>
I would please want to know, how i could use Hyperledger Indy to build a blockchain, that would be able to host user data.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 24 Jul 2019 20:15:42 GMT):<br/>
Hyperledger Indy is not a blockchain for storing user data but rather a blockchain designed to allow users to hold their own data and selectively disclose as much or as little information as they desire with those that ask for it. This might be a good article to read as a primer on self-sovereign identity: https://medium.com/@AlexPreukschat/self-sovereign-identity-a-guide-to-privacy-for-your-digital-identity-5b9e95677778

Hello, I have a couple of questions about the revocation flow that I'd love if anyone could help me with. 

The process of issuing a credential creates 3 artifacts: 
    - cred_json - This one is somewhat self explanatory and is securely sent to the credential holder.
    - cred_revoc_id - The docstring for this var says -> `local id for revocation info (Can be used for revocation of this cred)`
    - revoc_reg_delta_json - This seems to be the only artifact necessary to create the revocation registry entry request

My understanding is that given the `cred_revoc_id`, I can run `anoncreds.issuer_revoke_credential` to re-create my `revoc_reg_delta_json`. 

* So out of curiosity, is there currently a standard way of storing the `cred_revoc_id`s in a manner that is correlated to the credential as well as the holder within the wallet ?
* Is there a difference between the `revoc_reg_delta_json` that is created at the point of credential issuance, and the `revoc_reg_delta_json` created later ?

Does anyone have pointers to the code that show some key parts of the demo? (Say, where the proof requests and send credential offer are in the code ) Links to a repo will help, or even function fragments.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 14:48:34 GMT):<br/>
That was a plan for that code base, but it is now rather dated. As your next steps in exploring, you might want to look at aries-cloudagent-python, which has similar demos, and some additional resources to learn the code.  The best place to get started is here - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/tree/master/docs/GettingStartedAriesDev

It's first step takes you to what you probably have looked at the - Indy chapter from the edX.

We recently did an Architectural Deep Dive into that code and the associated recording and slide presentation is available.  I'll add that to the aries-cloudagent-python in the next couple of days.

I think the code in the walkthrough is taken from the `getting-started.py` in this directory: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/samples/python

Some very basic instructions for running those components are in the README in that directory but if that's not working for you, please reach out.

I also highly recommend looking into the Aries Cloud Agent python getting started guide linked above by @swcurran

Problem: PoolLedgerTimeout error when calling createPoolLedgerConfig 

Initial diagnosis: I read somewhere that the cause might be that the IP addresses in the pool configuration and genesis file might not match. 

Environment: 
I have an agent (a nodejs web app) running in localhost and I have a pool of four indy validator nodes running in a docker container. I am using Mac OS. The docker containers have IP address ranging from 173.17.0.101 to 173.17.0.104 and the ports ranging from 9701 to 9708 and there is port forwarding to host enabled. The ledger browser is at 173.17.0.101:9000 and I can access the same using localhost:9000. In the genesis file that I supply to agent, I change the 173.17 ip addresses to 127.0.0.1.

What I did to connect:
I made the genesis file (that was created during the start of the pool) available to the agent by passing the path of the file to createPoolLedgerConfig method as an argument. 

Can anyone please point out if I am missing something?
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 16:49:52 GMT):<br/>
does the genesis file have the correct client and node ips?
</p>
<p><strong>AlexITC</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 16:50:21 GMT):<br/>
while trying to run the python samples, I get `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'indy'`, I believe it needs to be installed manually

<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 16:54:14 GMT):<br/>
Try creating a virtual environment (`python3 -m venv env`), activating it (`source env/bin/activate`), and installing indy with `pip install python3-indy` then give running the sample another shot
</p>
<p><strong>AlexITC</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 16:55:13 GMT):<br/>
I'll try that, thanks
</p>
<p><strong>AlexITC</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 16:55:48 GMT):<br/>
then, I get `ImportError: cannot import name 'anoncreds'`
</p>
<p><strong>AlexITC</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 16:56:01 GMT):<br/>
isn't there a `requirements` file to install everything at once?
</p>
<p><strong>AlexITC</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 16:56:09 GMT):<br/>
or are these dependencies listed anywhere?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 16:57:28 GMT):<br/>
Typically there is. Off the top of my head, I'm not sure the samples directory does this. Try `pip install -e .`
</p>
<p><strong>AlexITC</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 16:58:06 GMT):<br/>
I guess that's likely on the actual python wrapper
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:00:36 GMT):<br/>
I just did a quick sanity check on my machine and was able to run the getting started guide with these steps:

```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -e .
python src/getting-started.py
```

So installing python3-indy may not be necessary
</p>
<p><strong>AlexITC</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:01:19 GMT):<br/>
hmm, I was trying to run just python by using pyenv

I am using nodejs agent
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:24:35 GMT):<br/>
From https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-agent ?
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:25:49 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm is the right person to answer you. I have not used that code. But I have used through aries cloud agent and agent-framework and I did not have issues
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:27:41 GMT):<br/>
btw
</p>
<p><strong>ravip</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:28:00 GMT):<br/>
@dbluhm : From this link : https://github.com/hyperledger/education.git
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:28:05 GMT):<br/>
I think you need to pass the file name with the path not only the [ath "/Users/me/blockchain_project/dir/test/gtf"
</p>
<p><strong>ravip</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:28:32 GMT):<br/>
I guess both the links have the same nodejs agent?
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:28:51 GMT):<br/>
try passing the file name too
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:31:39 GMT):<br/>
@sukalpomitra 's suggestion may work but I very highly recommend you instead look into the Aries Cloud Agent - Python project for an up to date introduction into the Indy/Aries communities. The Node.js agent contains a lot of early thinking that has been greatly improved on since. A good getting started guide for the Aries Cloud Agent (ACA) can be found here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/tree/master/docs/GettingStartedAriesDev
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:33:01 GMT):<br/>
The node.js agent is essentially deprecated and unmaintained
</p>
<p><strong>ravip</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:43:04 GMT):<br/>
So I tried @sukalpomitra  's suggestion. but no luck trying to connect.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:50:44 GMT):<br/>
Again, I encourage you to look into ACA-Py. I believe your time will be far better spent there. As for the issues you're experiencing, @swcurran may be the best person to answer your questions as he's the original author of that particular demo, borrowing code from the Node.js agent.
</p>
<p><strong>ravip</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 18:42:21 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for pointing that out @dbluhm 
</p>
<p><strong>ravip</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 18:59:50 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran  Whenever you are free, can you share your insight on what might be the cause of this.
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 19:47:08 GMT):<br/>
"In the genesis file that I supply to agent, I change the 173.17 ip addresses to 127.0.0.1." - this will not work.  You need to have matching IP's in the node and client.  You need to either run your app in a docker container (that recognizes the nodes' IP's) or else run a set of nodes that are listening on 127.0.0.1
</p>
<p><strong>ravip</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 20:13:13 GMT):<br/>
@ianco : thanks for the response, so you are saying the genesis file at both locations (pool and agent) should have the same IPs?
What if the indy nodes are run in a docker container? Isnt is possible that they have IPs which are not recognizable by an agent running elsewhere?
Unless yes they are resolved to same host address.

But again in this case genesis file at both the locations could have different IPs?
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 20:17:16 GMT):<br/>
As far as I know the IP's have to match, so the nodes need to be running on publicly accessible IP's, or else the agent (or other client app) needs to be running on the same docker network.
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 20:18:13 GMT):<br/>
There is a script in the indy-sdk that will start up a set of nodes on 127.0.0.1 https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk#1-starting-the-test-pool-on-localhost
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 20:18:42 GMT):<br/>
Or else von-network will run a set of nodes that are accessible inside  a docker network  https://github.com/bcgov/von-network

... or else you need publicly accessible IP's.  The BC Gov runs a test network (BCovrin) - you can see the ledger browser here:  http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io/  (I think this is the one referenced in some of our tutorials)

<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 20:21:04 GMT):<br/>
You can connect to the Sovrin Staging Network, but you need to get someone at Sovrin to create your DID's for you

I found this while following the walkthrough, does anyone knows the algorithm name?
```
Faber authenticates and encrypts the message by calling crypto.auth_crypt function, which is an implementation of the authenticated-encryption schema. Authenticated encryption is designed for sending of a confidential message specifically for the Recipient. The Sender can compute a shared secret key using the Recipient's public key (verkey) and his secret (signing) key. The Recipient can compute exactly the same shared secret key using the Sender's public key (verkey) and his secret (signing) key. That shared secret key can be used to verify that the encrypted message was not tampered with, before eventually decrypting it.

<p><strong>mattatkiva</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 17:12:05 GMT):<br/>
is there a way to recover a credential definition if the wallet is deleted (accidentally)?   

its easy to create a new wallet, recreate the DID using the same seed.....I am not able to create the same credential definition as the public part is on the ledger.

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 17:17:58 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 17:29:36 GMT):<br/>
but if I am not wrong you can again create the cred def schema using the schema id, a ltransaction is written in the ledger, but the cred def id remains the same

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:03:16 GMT):<br/>
Yes, you can create it again. But you can't reuse the old one - I believe you have to bump the verison.  Unlike with DIDs, you can't pass in a seed for a Cred Def, so you can't recreate an identical one. It would make development a lot easier if that was possible, but alas, no.  :-(
</p>
<p><strong>mattatkiva</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:09:58 GMT):<br/>
what happens if a cred def is created, credentials are made against the def, the wallet creating the cred def is deleted.....

are the existing credentials now invalid?  
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:16:10 GMT):<br/>
No - the existing credentials will still work. No new credentials can be issued, but existing ones will continue to be provable.
</p>
<p><strong>mattatkiva</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:16:38 GMT):<br/>
can they be revoked (assuming the revocation entries existed)?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:16:58 GMT):<br/>
But, like with losing your wallet containing credentials and keys - don't do it. Backups, restoration are crucial in any key-based systems.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:18:25 GMT):<br/>
It depends exactly what you lost.  I believe if you ONLY lost the cred def, you could revoke them (it makes sense...), but if you also lost your private key for writing to the ledger, you would be stuck.  If you lost all the information about the credentials you have issued, you would be lost.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:19:06 GMT):<br/>
Not 100% sure on the revocation, but my guess is because of the rest of that, it's likely moot.
</p>
<p><strong>mattatkiva</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:21:45 GMT):<br/>
yes, that makes sense.  I wanted to confirm.   we will need to use the wallet backup functionality.   We discovered this problem while building out an environment.  So I thought I would ask, just in case we were missing something in our thinking

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:24:11 GMT):<br/>
We also found it early in our development and led to us largely using per developer ledger instances for testing. Shared testing ledgers are harder.  We're now shifting to random DIDs vs. set DID seeds, which actually makes it easier - share a schema, but make new DIDs and Cred Defs on every run. Our devs at BC Gov might have a better view.
</p>
<p><strong>mattatkiva</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:57:25 GMT):<br/>
related to that:  if we rotate a key used to create a cred def, will the previously issued credentials still work?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 01 Aug 2019 18:59:41 GMT):<br/>
There is no way to rotate the cred def keys (there is one key per claim). To "rotate" the keys, you would version the cred def - create a new one.  The existing credentials would still work and use the old version, new credentials would use the new version.

The issuer can rotate the key of their DID, but not of a cred def.

I wonder about this config entry for the pool, which is a hardcoded path to something that doesn't exists on my system, I was thinking that it is possibly related to the docker pool but I haven't been able to find if that's true, `"genesis_txn":  "/home/vagrant/code/evernym/indy-sdk/cli/docker_pool_transactions_genesis"`
</p>
<p><strong>AlexITC</strong> (Sun, 04 Aug 2019 05:19:35 GMT):<br/>
I was able to update the path to the correct one but I get a timeout after the next step, running the same how-to with python leads to a timeout too, `Error occurred: (<ErrorCode.PoolLedgerTimeout: 307>, {'backtrace': '', 'message': 'Error: Pool timeout\n  Caused by: Pool timeout\n'})`, the pool is supposed to be running properly because the libindy rust tests are passing and they use the pool
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Sun, 04 Aug 2019 11:31:34 GMT):<br/>
generally in my experience I have seen the pool timeout comes when the clientip/nodeip are not resolvable/reachable

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=3zJzqkz6ALgTBWXJA) @AlexITC In the how tos file, there is a utils.py, wherein Genesis transaction is written hard coded. Here is the link: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/docs/how-tos/write-did-and-query-verkey/python/utils.py

In the file itself, there is an env variable TEST_POOL_IP, you can try setting the variable to your node's IP

I have saw that, I was following the Java example, sadly, neither the python one works, I wonder how can I know which IP is the pool running in
</p>
<p><strong>ShrinivasDeshmukh</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 15:03:21 GMT):<br/>
Its your machine's IP (192.168 or 10.20.x.x). if your machine is behind firewall, your local IP might not be resolvable. You can try docker inspect and get ip of the containers and give them in the pool config.

Hi everyone, I am getting following error while submitting cred def to the ledger:
`Transaction has been rejected: validation error [ClientClaimDefSubmitOperation]: cannot be smaller than 1 (ref=0)`
the `buildCredDefRequest` method returns json, with ref=0.  Any solutions?
</p>
<p><strong>ShrinivasDeshmukh</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 09:29:11 GMT):<br/>
Also, I am getting `commonInvalidStructure` error while using `issuerCreateAndStoreRevocReg`. I've passed parameters as per npm's indy-sdk document. I think the error might be with tailsWriterHandle, what is this param, and what should I pass into it?

Hi can anyone help me with understanding credential schema and credential definition. the difference between them and the relationship between them
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:00:38 GMT):<br/>
As far I understand them, a schema can be issued by any issuer but makes more sense when a standardising body creates it. All issuers then follow this schema to create their credential def schema. A schema can have n attributes while a cred def schema will have the same n attributes and may have some more. A credential definition schema is tagged to an issuer and can only be used by the issuer who has created it. So to my understanding a schema is more for standardising attributes that should be used if an issuer wants to issue a credential. A credential definition schema on the other hand gives the credential to add more info on top of it and for a verifier to say that he only trusts Issuer A and will only verify credentials issued by Issuer A or credential definition schema A.
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:16:06 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for your quick response
as I understood your explaination, you are saying that goverment should create all schemas and organizations eg. Faber, Acme should create a mashup of theses schemas to generate a desired credential definition. if that is the case then can credential definition be created by a normal user(who is not a trust anchor)?
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:17:21 GMT):<br/>
no afaik to create a credential definition schema or a schema definition you need to have a role of TRUST ANCHOR. 
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:18:05 GMT):<br/>
ok, then why do we need credentail definition why cant we upgrade the existin schema or create a new schema?
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:18:55 GMT):<br/>
well as ai said schema is for all to use , while a credential definition schema is tagged to a definite issuer(TRUST ANCHOR)
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:20:20 GMT):<br/>
if i understand correctly then you mean that if faber has created a credential def then acme cannot use the  same def even if it is requred to g?enerate a def with the same attributes
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:20:39 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:21:24 GMT):<br/>
and then a verifier using that cred def can say a holder that i only accept Faber or Acme's credentials or both
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:21:25 GMT):<br/>
 but the cred def is written to the ledger that mean its public data
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:22:05 GMT):<br/>
then how are we restricting the sharing usage of the cred def?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:23:20 GMT):<br/>
FYI - a Cred Def does not have other attributes. It references a schema previously written to the ledger. Those are the only attributes in credentials issued related to that Cred Def.
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:24:39 GMT):<br/>
is it possible to refer to multiple schemas and restrict some attributes?
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:25:48 GMT):<br/>
oh I always thought a cred def should always have all the attributes in the schema plus it can add its own
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:27:28 GMT):<br/>
the cred def when you write to the ledger is alsio written to the wallet. You cannot issue a credential with a cred def that is not present in your wallet
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:28:36 GMT):<br/>
then what can we do with the cred def if we are reading it from the ledger?
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:29:35 GMT):<br/>
I guess you can query the ledger and get the attributes it supports and write a proof request using them
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:29:35 GMT):<br/>
I guess as a verifier you can query the ledger and get the attributes it supports and write a proof request using them
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:30:48 GMT):<br/>
but as far as I know the proof request has a whole new structure which comprises of self attested, verifyable and zkp values?
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:32:06 GMT):<br/>
A proof request consists of requested"_attributes, requested_predicates and self_attested_attributes. These are all objects that has a name property that requires the attribute name
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:32:43 GMT):<br/>
didnt understand
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:32:47 GMT):<br/>
:(
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:34:10 GMT):<br/>
A proof request json has property names such as requested_attributes , the value for which is a list of object. the object then has a property called name, whose value are the attribute names
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:36:20 GMT):<br/>
umm ok but where is the cred def in this picture?
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:36:48 GMT):<br/>
that same object also has one more property called restrictions which ios a list of creed def id
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:36:48 GMT):<br/>
that same object also has one more property called restrictions which is a list of cred def id
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:38:58 GMT):<br/>
but isnt it a use of cred def? my question was around what is cred def and how is it different from cred schema
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:41:52 GMT):<br/>
maybe go here and see how a cred def looks like in ledger. And then change the type to schema and query to see how it looks like. http://138.197.138.255/browse/domain?page=1&query=lrole&txn_type=102
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:43:49 GMT):<br/>
Also when the verifier sets restrictions with a list of cred def, it actually says i need proof only from issuers who have written these cred def. The cred def id also has the public DID for the issuer
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:46:48 GMT):<br/>
Yes. And a public key per attribute used for signing the claim in the credential.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:47:04 GMT):<br/>
A schema is just a list of attributes.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:48:05 GMT):<br/>
Cred Def also links to the optional revocation registry for the credentials issued against the Cred Def.
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:52:44 GMT):<br/>
thanks for this clarification. If i understand correctly then it means that a cred def is a usable instance of a schema that consists of the schema itself plus revocation registry details and a public key (of the issuer). if this is true then why do we need schemas and not just use cred def instead?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:54:42 GMT):<br/>
So that we get common use of schema.  We don't want every issuer to make up there own schema.  They can, but that does not lead to interoperability.  For example, we'd like every university to use the same format for credentials, so verifiers would know how to handle the credential regardless of the source.  Not likely - so we can't force it - but an ideal to aim for and make possible.
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:56:28 GMT):<br/>
got it...that means the a credential def is the draft of a credential where as schemas are guidelines..correct?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 17:58:12 GMT):<br/>
Not really. The attributes listed in the schema are the attributes in the credentials that are issued.  The cred def uses the list of attributes to know what key pairs to make - one for each attribute.  So they are all tied together.
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 18:02:08 GMT):<br/>
ok...so i can say that a cred def is the structural base of a cred that is refering to one or more schemas plus other usable information such as revocation and keys?
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 18:02:51 GMT):<br/>
which will be useful to validate the proof attributes
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 18:04:37 GMT):<br/>
just more one quick question, what is signifance of the class atrribute in the cred def? as I could see only "CL" as a value being supplied to that attribute
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 18:05:30 GMT):<br/>
One schema right now. Next version of schema has another layer of indirection, but current has only one schema per Cred Def.
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 06 Aug 2019 18:06:09 GMT):<br/>
ok

I thought I heard recommendations in the past to avoid that practice. I wanted to confirm if that is the best practice.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 20:37:08 GMT):<br/>
Not certain, but I'm guessing it is the signature being used.  "CL" is the cryptographic scheme - CL Signature - used by HL Indy.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 20:37:31 GMT):<br/>
I'm guessing they've added an attribute so that they can change in the scheme in the future.
</p>
<p><strong>AlexITC</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 23:04:10 GMT):<br/>
turns out that the logs are exposed to the wrappers, in which case, the java wrapper already logs them
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 23:05:03 GMT):<br/>
There is a limit to how big a message can be before timeouts are exceeded. This prevents messages from containing large images.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 23:05:47 GMT):<br/>
We have put small images in credentials, but the correct solution is to follow the emerging W3C standard for Verifiable Credentials which Brent and Ken have been working to bring to Indy.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 23:40:35 GMT):<br/>
@sklump is working on that use case and has been successful at putting in an image into a credential.  Definitely works!

The other consideration is semantics: is the image a PNG, BMP, JPEG, etc? The issuer needs to know what he's been proposed to issue, and the holder agent has to know how to render it. So there is metadata per credential and attribute to store in the holder wallet.

Also, a cleverer cryptographer than I may find a way to attack naïve image attribute propagation with steganography. What if the error-check bits all resolve to some obscene image? 

Does it matter? When I was at Entrust there was a hue and cry when our random one-time-registration-password generator threw up a code with very bad embedded word in an early version for a high-visibility customer. There was trouble, and the next version added some checks.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 16:07:51 GMT):<br/>
Yes and Yes. The Credential is created and delivered from the Issuer to the Holder/Prover and the Credential and claims are signed - cannot be changed. If you want to change the data in the credential, you have to create and provide a new one - and you will probably revoke the old one.

Hello,
I'm trying to compare different SSI solutions. We've built something based on uport's libs, but we wanted to go the *source* with indy to check how it compares. I've already read a lot of documentation, but I was wondering how to obtain a DID document? I've only seen the examples to get basic DID infos or specific attributes, but I was wondering if there's an easy method to get a complete JSON-LD DID document, such as with uport's DID resolver: https://github.com/uport-project/did-resolver
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Mon, 12 Aug 2019 11:06:02 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/pull/130 replaces and supersedes PR#60. It includes support for Aries#0037. I can demo some good bits any time.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Mon, 12 Aug 2019 13:12:25 GMT):<br/>
The Indy ledger actually predates DID Documents; as you've pointed it out, it uses "attributes" instead right now but I believe full DID Doc support is a high priority, especially with the migration of the Indy Agent work to  Hyperledger Aries.
</p>
<p><strong>TimBenke</strong> (Mon, 12 Aug 2019 13:17:13 GMT):<br/>
yes, we're considering Indy because it seems very central in the SSI community. We've also discovered that e.g. uport seems to be missing important parts like revocation lists/registries that Indy already has.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Mon, 12 Aug 2019 13:42:04 GMT):<br/>
VON anchor includes DID doc support for parsing and serialization: https://github.com/PSPC-SPAC-buyandsell/von_anchor/blob/master/von_anchor/a2a/diddoc.py, https://github.com/PSPC-SPAC-buyandsell/von_anchor/blob/master/test/test_a2a.py

I wonder if any of you have used indy to work without ZK-proofs, the idea is that the complete credentials are  shared and the issuers have revocation lists
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 12 Aug 2019 16:50:26 GMT):<br/>
I don't think anyone has done that.  Pretty much everything that the community has done has used core indy-sdk capabilities of which both of those are a part.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Mon, 12 Aug 2019 16:55:11 GMT):<br/>
As a reminder, even when using Indy Credentials using ZKP, it is possible to simply reveal the attributes certified in a credential.
</p>
<p><strong>AlexITC</strong> (Mon, 12 Aug 2019 16:56:17 GMT):<br/>

Use of Alice and Faber in demos is so common now that you'll have to give a little more info about which demo you're referring to :slight_smile: There is a mobile app that could be a good starting point: https://github.com/mattrglobal/osma

It is based on the dotnet Agent framework which should be compatible with the Aries Cloud Agent and other dotnet agent framework based apps

If I want to use the *indy_register_wallet_storage* to register a  custom wallet storage implementation, is it possible to access the function through NodeJS. 

It doesn't appear accessible through the provided SDK.
</p>
<p><strong>mattatkiva</strong> (Tue, 13 Aug 2019 16:16:47 GMT):<br/>
the method you mentioned is designed to be called by a "plugin" (I use the word loosely) that handles custom wallet storage.   Consumers of a plugin will call the plugin initialization method (and the plugin itself calls indy_register_wallet_storage).   Check out the postgres plugin.

If you're feeling thats backwards, I join you. :D That's how it works.

I was running the Alice <-> ACME <-> Faber  demo. ACME sends a proof of request for transcript data to Alice and she accepts it. Where exactly is the transcript data living and in which message does it flow from Alice to ACME?

</p>
<p><strong>gcsfred</strong> (Tue, 13 Aug 2019 19:22:24 GMT):<br/>
Another question: do credentials hold the very data?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 13 Aug 2019 19:39:21 GMT):<br/>
The transcript data was given by Faber to Alice when it issued the credential in the Faber-Alice part of the demo. It is stored by Alice in the credential from Faber in her wallet. The claims from that credential flows from Alice to ACME in the proof that is sent in the "Credential-Presentation" message.
</p>
<p><strong>gcsfred</strong> (Tue, 13 Aug 2019 19:42:32 GMT):<br/>
Is the data encrypted in the credential message? Is the encrypted data stored in the blockchain? 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 13 Aug 2019 19:46:53 GMT):<br/>
In Aries, the message itself is encrypted from the sender (Alice) to the receiver (ACME).  Once the message is decrypted, the presentation JSON with the claims is in plaintext.

No data is sent to the Blockchain. Ever.  It is only used for DIDs, schema/credential metadata and revocation information.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 13 Aug 2019 19:47:16 GMT):<br/>
The things you need to verify the proof.
</p>
<p><strong>gcsfred</strong> (Tue, 13 Aug 2019 19:49:18 GMT):<br/>
Ok. Can a credential be revoked? 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 13 Aug 2019 21:46:00 GMT):<br/>
Yes-ish. Indy supports revocation. I'm not sure that any of the Aries implementations support revocation. ACA-Py does not, but it's predecessor, von_agent does.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 13 Aug 2019 21:47:38 GMT):<br/>
Issuer can revoke at anytime.  The Prover does a zero-knowledger "prove of non-revocation" to show that at some point in time, the credential was not revoked.  The verifier defines to the prover an acceptable period for the proof.

I found this presentation and I wonder if this means that indy is going to be rewritten, or abandoned for a new project: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQetphlWf2TEb-zarMnJFbvkK4r2USIgAYOyeKAMzCL5EU1nUMdZB4q8BSY6bJGpYi8D5TIB2ezEOHo/pub#slide=id.g4245334205_0_1344
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 14:53:40 GMT):<br/>
Indy will not be abandoned. The Consensus algorithm noted as having need for improvement and potentially replacement is truthfully a very small part of Indy. I believe those conversations eventually resolved to, rather than replace Plenum, improve it's view change strategy to that used by PBFT I think. The Indy team may be able to add more info there.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 14:55:03 GMT):<br/>
It's also worth mentioning that what Indy is responsible for is evolving with the split off of the Indy Agent community into the Hyperledger Aries project.

For performance reasons we are considering cacheing (holding in memory) schema and credential definitions.  is there any reason we should never cache a credential definition (thats the result of parseGetCredDefResponse)?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 16:11:05 GMT):<br/>
I believe caching was recently added as a feature of the Indy SDK but I'm not sure on the details. Just making sure you're aware.

<p><strong>ShrinivasDeshmukh</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 16:11:57 GMT):<br/>
Hi @swcurran, while going through aries code for revocation, I found revocation is not supported. Here is the link:  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/02050bd1d32f84807d8bc270318aee55949e8390/aries_cloudagent/holder/indy.py#L86 . Just curious to know if there is any specific reason for this?
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 17:55:21 GMT):<br/>
We (bc gov) cache credential definitions, I'm not sure offhand about the specifics
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 18:01:25 GMT):<br/>
Yes - time :-).  We're starting to talk about adding support for revocation now.  We had hoped that the AnonCreds 2.0 work with the re-vamped revocation mechanism be in place before we needed it, but we suspect that we'll go with the existing mechanism.  We're thinking that from the agent side, the 1.0 to 2.0 change will not be that significant vs. the overall effort to support revocation.

The plan is to use as much of what we can from https://von-anchor.readthedocs.io, and in particular it's Tails server implementation - https://readthedocs.org/projects/von-tails/ 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 18:02:26 GMT):<br/>
Tails files are a big part of what makes the AnonCreds 1.0 implementation hard, and if we can just spin up a single tails server and use it, the 1.0 to 2.0 delta will be simpler.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 02:50:54 GMT):<br/>
Aries is the protocol for agent to agent communication. It is becoming widely adopted and is not going away any time soon. Indy is one method of storing the schemas and public keys necessary for a third party to verify Aries credentials. We don't expect it to go away any time soon.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 02:51:26 GMT):<br/>
But as @dbluhm explained, the consensus algorithm will need to evolve in order to support the scale we expect to need with the Sovrin network.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 02:52:18 GMT):<br/>
Our work to replace PBFT view change will address the biggest current problem, but there are many more problems that will need to be addressed over time. That presentation is to raise awareness, so that others will help in finding solutions.

Hi all, 
I'm conducting a survey for a research project examining the acceptance of self-sovereign identity (SSI) and the influence of digital privacy. I would be very grateful if you could take a few minutes to answer the questionnaire. The survey should take about 8 minutes to complete.

I highly appreciate your support! Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

I wonder if I is possible to issue a credential without requiring the credential subject to accept it, for example, suppose that the subject is offline when the credential is issued and the subject doesn't have any agent that's online
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Sun, 18 Aug 2019 05:52:08 GMT):<br/>
The acceptance comes at the offer state. Once the holder accepts, then credential is issued straight. For the point you mentioned, that is why a cloud agent should be used. So that when the edge agent comes online it can get the messages from the cloud agent.

From what I understand, the credential holder generates proof and the verifier perform proof validation without interacting with the Indy network. in the Verifiable Credentials ecosystem (https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-toronto/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/verifiable-credentials-primer.md) it is mentioned that `Verifier verifies identifier ownership against identifier registry`. Can anybody clarify this step?

In Indy, the credential offer is required.  You can read more about the process in the RFC on issuing a credential, with a link to the code in Indy.

https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0036-issue-credential#offer-credential
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 14:50:19 GMT):<br/>
There are lots of confused statements in what you've written here - suggest that you keep reading.  Perhaps this document might give you the background - it used to be a chapter in the edX Blockchain for Business course - https://github.com/swcurran/education/blob/master/LFS171x/docs/introduction-to-hyperledger-indy.md

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 14:53:01 GMT):<br/>
A quick try at your comments:

- Your cred def contains your DID and goes to the ledger - that's right.

- a DID is resolved to a DID Doc.  The DID Doc contains the public key, and you hold the private key

- a Cred Def also contains a set of public keys that are used to sign the claims within the credentials that will be issued against the cred def.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 14:54:52 GMT):<br/>
Depends on your goal. A good way to get started is to use the `aries-cloudagent-python` to get started.  This guide gives you a starting point.  If you know enough about Indy, you can skip the first (although it's good if you are just getting started).  The rest summarize getting going in development:

https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/tree/master/docs/GettingStartedAriesDev  
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 14:57:22 GMT):<br/>
Both the holder and the verifier interact with the Indy network to do the proof and verification, respectively. 

In Indy, that statement from the RWoT paper is not correct. Indy uses a different approach to prove that the holder owns the credential - a ZKP that does not disclose correlating data about the holder.
</p>
<p><strong>kingpinXD</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 20:04:27 GMT):<br/>
okay the last point is what made it all clear
</p>
<p><strong>kingpinXD</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 20:08:21 GMT):<br/>
Hey Guys , I was wondering, what's your opinion about using indy for enterprise blockchain. Where the members of the system are different applications, which are onboarded on the platform by a master application. These applications are then given a role of trust anchors, they can then issue credentials to their users. The users can then use the credentials to when they want to use the the rest apis exposed by these applications. Effectively removing the need for the user to login, they sort of just send the zkp in the header.  
Is anybody working on a project like this? does an agent like this exist which enables an application ( Basically a webserver with certain routes to be onboarded ?

when issuing a credential, first a credential offer is sent which requires access to the issuer wallet, I wonder if creating this offer requires the private key that will be used for actually issuing the credential
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 16:43:59 GMT):<br/>
You need to look through the SDK for that. Based on the wording in the RFC for issuing a credential, yes - the issuer is making a cryptographic commitment. There is a link later in the section to the IndySDK code.

https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0036-issue-credential#offer-credential
</p>
<p><strong>AlexITC</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 16:45:54 GMT):<br/>
that's my understanding, is there a way to use diffferent keys? like issuing a key that issues certificates, an another key that only signs credential offers
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 16:54:24 GMT):<br/>
Sorry - don't know it that level of detail.  I think that's getting into Ursa territory.

Perhaps @MALodder might be able to answer that.

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 17:19:43 GMT):<br/>
The key used for signing credentials can't be used for signing anything else. I'm not clear on what you mean by signing certificates
</p>
<p><strong>AlexITC</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 17:21:28 GMT):<br/>
there are two phases for issuing a credential, a credential offer is send, and when the subject replies with the credential request, the issuer issues the credential
</p>
<p><strong>AlexITC</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 17:22:20 GMT):<br/>
My problem is that I want to issue a bunch of credentials and the subject may not be available to reply to the credential offer, which would lead me to keep the issuer key hot for a good amount of time instead of just issuing the batch and move the key to cold storage
</p>
<p><strong>AlexITC</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 17:37:51 GMT):<br/>
I see two potential solutions to that problem, the one stated above, or, a cloud agent acting on the subject behalf that accepts credential offers and replies with credential request, but I would only consider that if the agent can't do more actions than that, which I don't know if is possible
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 17:39:02 GMT):<br/>
agents can do just that phase
</p>
<p><strong>AlexITC</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 18:56:00 GMT):<br/>
that may work, I will research if they can just do that and nothing else, thanks!

npm ERR! errno ECONNRESET . If someone could shred some light it would be helpful. I configured npm proxy already in this format --->  npm config set https-proxy http://<username>:<password>@<proxy>:<port>

Hi, I see there is a method `buildGetRevocRegDeltaRequest` in the npm indy-sdk, but we are not writing the revocRegDelta to the ledger. I cannot find a method in the npm indy-sdk to write the `revocRegDelta` to the ledger.

As per my understanding, `issuerCreateCredential` returns revocRegDelta as well. Once the credential is saved to wallet, how should we fetch the revocRegDelta? I need the `revocRegDelta` for creating revocation state.

Hi Folks.... While i tries to start up TheOrgBook instance i've been getting the below listed errror for the past 2 days....any idea why this happens?

Recreating 774248dac3ef_tob_tob-api_1 ... error

ERROR: for tob-api  Cannot start service tob-api: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint tob_tob-api_1 (c866bc0703b7c134551a7ffa0630cc86a052c599bb9041b929aa9129821c7c3b): Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:3000: bind: address already in use

i don't use proxy for this one...as i was trying it out from my home network.

It looks like something else is using port 3000. ‘docker ps’ might provide more info 
</p>
<p><strong>esune</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 16:57:36 GMT):<br/>
What @andrew.whitehead said seems correct. I have also seen this issue (on Windows) when the Docker daemon got itself in trouble for some reason. Restarting Docker fixed it for me - assuming the port is really not in use already.

For this error `Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:3000: bind: address already in use` the offending port is `3000`, and I'm not sure what's running on this port.  If you comment out the port mapping in the docker-compose.yml file `#- 3000:3000` everything seems to still work.  @andrew.whitehead  any thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 23:53:02 GMT):<br/>
That port is only used by the ptvsd debugger, so likely fine to disable the mapping

That port is only used by the ptvsd debugger, so likely fine to disable the mapping. Not sure what else uses that port, could be a virus scanner or something 
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Fri, 23 Aug 2019 02:41:51 GMT):<br/>
@ianco you can use netstat to find what is running on 3000 and then use the pid to kill the process 
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 23 Aug 2019 04:26:19 GMT):<br/>
It would be something running inside the docker container though ...
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Fri, 23 Aug 2019 04:59:27 GMT):<br/>
I doubt it as your docker-compose is failing while starting the container.. so I think something is already running and if you get the pid you can kill it

There is no error message, just the verification method returns False. Here are the steps I am doing:
1. Create schema and write to ledger
2. create cred def and write to ledger
3. create revoc reg and write the delta and revoc reg to ledger
4. create cred offer
5. issuer cred
5. Save cred to wallet
6. generate proof_request
7. Fetch revocRegDelta and revocRegDef from ledger
8. generate proof
9. Fetch revocRegDelta and revocRegDef from ledger
10. Verify proof

from my understanding, issuing credentials doesn't need to store a proof in the ledger, is there a simple way to get a proof on the ledger? or is it designed this way?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 16:43:25 GMT):<br/>
Can you clarify what your intent is for having a proof on the ledger?

A really short answer would be yes it is designed this way
</p>
<p><strong>AlexITC</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 20:44:38 GMT):<br/>
the reason is to be able to detect fake credentials in case of the key getting compromised, without they being in the ledger, there is no way to detect them
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 20:50:16 GMT):<br/>
Calling in @MALodder to check my answer but (assuming the key you're talking about is the issuer's key being compromised) when the issuer discovers that it's issuing key has been compromised, the issuer rotates the key. Since issued credentials are tied to the DID and not the key of the issuer in order to verify it, rotating and updating the DIDDoc with the new key would effectively invalidate all credentials issued with the previous key.
</p>
<p><strong>AlexITC</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 20:50:51 GMT):<br/>
so, rotating the key means that you need to reissue everything
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 20:52:43 GMT):<br/>
I believe so but I'm not an expert on this
</p>
<p><strong>AlexITC</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 20:53:18 GMT):<br/>
in fact, it makes sense, I think I remember I saw something like that in the source code
</p>
<p><strong>AlexITC</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 20:53:20 GMT):<br/>
thanks

<p><strong>brentzundel</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 22:06:09 GMT):<br/>
to clarify: the public keys for an issuer's credential signature are in the cred def. The cred def is linked to the issuer's DID, but the DID keys are not otherwise related to the keys used to issue a credential, i.e., they aren't stored in the DIDDoc.
Rotation of the keys in a cred def would make all previously issued credentials unverifiable, essentially revoking them all and requiring a re-issuance of credentials using the new keys.
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 22:25:00 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the clarification!

Performed the below steps on ubuntu VM : 
docker build --build-arg pool_ip=192.168.179.90 -f ci/indy-pool.dockerfile -t indy_pool .
docker run -itd -p 192.168.179.90:9701-9708:9701-9708 indy_pool

Gave the Ubuntu VM IP address in the  docker_pool_transaction_genesis file. I created a pool on ubuntu VM : default-pool
Took  the config.json file of the  default-pool : {"genesis_txn":"/root/indy_sdk_1.11.0/indy-sdk/cli/docker_pool_transactions_genesis"}


Used  Java sample from below location in react native android app  : 
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/samples/java/src/main/java

 I am using libIndy 1.11.0 and able to load libIndy successfully in android app.  : Used PoolUtils example  from 
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/wrappers/java/src/test/java/org/hyperledger/indy/sdk/utils/PoolUtils.java

 String poolConfig = "{\"genesis_txn\": \"/root/indy_sdk_1.11.0/indy-sdk/cli/docker_pool_transactions_genesis\"}";
     Pool.setProtocolVersion(2).get();
      
        String poolName = PoolUtils.createPoolLedgerConfig();
        Log.i("indy_sdk", poolName);
        System.out.println("\n2. Open pool ledger and get the pool handle from libindy.\n");
        Pool pool = Pool.openPoolLedger(poolName, poolConfig).get();

        System.out.println("\n2. Open pool ledger.\n");




Error :  indy_sdk: org.hyperledger.indy.sdk.InvalidStateException: The SDK library experienced an unexpected internal error.

If a pool is already created on ubuntu VM how can I connect to the existing pool by giving VM ipadress?  As  using another example I tried creating pool from mobile app  and that throws error pool Error: org.hyperledger.indy.sdk.pool.PoolConfigNotCreatedException: The requested pool cannot be opened because it does not have an existing configuration.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=Rm3PutHe3xeNngs43) @ptab-pawan You need to copy the pool.txn as well. It's better if you create a pool config on mobile side, using the pool.txn as gen txn file.

Hi, I have been through the demo at https://github.com/hyperledger/education/tree/master/LFS171x/indy-material/nodejs. I was able to successfully launch the demo, but this installs 4 nodes on the fly along with 5 agents. I need the following:
1. Launch nodes on the server
2. Add agents as and when required based on sign up functionality.
3. Able to add new nodes on another server which can sync with the current existing nodes.

Can someone help me with these please?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 02 Sep 2019 17:38:50 GMT):<br/>
@nitika-goel - that demo is pretty old and I would not recommend using that for anything more than understanding the concepts in self-sovereign identity. If you are just getting started in the space, you should be looking at Aries code, such as aries-cloudagent-python.  This getting started guide in that repo extends the edX blockchain course that (likely) led you to that demo - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/tree/master/docs/GettingStartedAriesDev

There is guidance in the von-network repo to help you run the nodes on a server.  https://github.com/bcgov/von-network

Hi, from what I understand from your query, the example which you are running is on Docker instances which doesn't give us control on the code. What you can do is , seperate the NodeJS code and try to run as independent service rather that in the Docker instance. This will give you more control over the code. We have done the same and it works.

From this url of hyperledger-indy demo, https://github.com/hyperledger/education/tree/master/LFS171x/indy-material/nodejs
all the nodes and agents (which are static) are running in the docker container automatically when runs the docker-compose.yml file.
Username and Password are defined in the docker-compose.yml file in the demo which is static process
How to do the sign up functionality dynamically ?

When i am trying to  call the method  :Pool.createPoolLedgerConfig(DEFAULT_POOL_NAME, createPoolLedgerConfigJSONParameter.toJson()).get();.

I have a ubuntu VM on the same N/W and i have done indy installation and setup a local pool there. Now from my macbook -> React native android I am trying to connect to  Ubuntu VM pool. I have given the Ubuntu IP in the  client_ip and node_ip. 


Now I changed the code to  write genesis content to  the pool.txn file  and pass the GenesisTxnFile.getAbsolutePath() to PoolJSONParameters.CreatePoolLedgerConfigJSONParameter. Output is 

 indy_sdk_genesisTxnFilePath: /data/user/0/com.indyssid/cache/indy/pool12.txn
 indy_sdk_createPoolLedgerConfigJSONParameter: {"genesis_txn":"/data/user/0/com.indyssid/cache/indy/pool12.txn"}  

indy_sdk: ================== Some Functionality Failed ==================
  indy_sdk: org.hyperledger.indy.sdk.pool.PoolLedgerConfigExistsException: A pool ledger configuration already exists with the specified name.
What I am doing wrong ?

In the current indy implementation it's possible to implement the storage of the wallet - will there be a similar "plugability" for signing? Right now the private keys are all within the software, if you wanted to move them into a HSM will that be made available and if so what are the timelines?

Hey guys, I'm trying to run the sample Hyperledger-indy on my Mac. I had success with it on Windows (I know lol). I am having the issue where it keep throwing:

java.lang.NullPointerException: null
	at org.hyperledger.indy.sdk.pool.Pool.setProtocolVersion(Pool.java:246) ~[indy-1.8.1-dev-1039.jar:na]

and it throws it on the line: Pool.setProtocolVersion(PROTOCOL_VERSION).get();


Does this mean my libindy is set-up incorrectly on the Mac?

[Update: Technically, I'm really asking about *Trust in a Digital Identity defined by it's associated DID and the Credential (set of Claims) associated with the DID*.  I'm clarifying this because when your start to research trust, trustworthiness, trust levels, etc., you end up coming across a lot of different articles about the trustworthiness of the content in Wikipedia, for example.]

<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 13:58:06 GMT):<br/>
Indy can be used to make a distributed immutable ledger of hash-linked data which by some definitions is a blockchain. It really depends on what definition you're going by since "blockchain" often implies a lot more within some communities.

for nodejs setLogger command:  is there some documentation on the level parameter:  4 means?  5 means what?  

```setLogger ( logFn )
Set a function to be called every time a log is emitted from libindy.

logFn: Function(Int level, String target, String message, String module_path, String file, Int line)
Example:

indy.setLogger(function (level, target, message, modulePath, file, line) {
    console.log('libindy said:', level, target, message, modulePath, file, line)

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 23:00:09 GMT):<br/>
@echoharker - yes.  The best description of the process (apart from digging into the code and academic papers) is here https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0011-cred-revocation
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 03:34:38 GMT):<br/>
A ZKP provides a pedersen commitment to the provers value in the accumulator, and a pedersen commitment to the witness accumulator that is the accumulator with every value minus the prover's value. These commitments are sent to the verifier who can check the actual accumulator value from the ledger matches. The commitment to the prover's value is also an attribute in his credential. 

Effectively, the holder is proving that the issuer signed the attribute in the primary credential, it hasn't changed, and is in the non-revocation registry

It's not Postgres specific - will be the same for any wallet.  We've done some assessment on our use case, but we'd be interested in what you see.

Every time you create a credential, the credential is stored in the `item` table and 2*# of claims in credential+6 encrypted `tags` are automatically created.  The six extra is an approximation right now based on our calculations - not looking at code.

The claim tags are needed if you want to use search queries to find credentials in your wallet with specific claim names and specific claim values.  If you know you don't need to search for credentials, you can set a credential tag policy in Indy that allows you to NOT create some or all of the claim tags. We'll have numbers soon, but we think we'll reduce tag storage by about 75-80%.

We found that the tags for the credentials we are using are about 0.5kb each, so depending on the credentials, it can take a lot of storage.

We also found that by default, our Aries agent is storing an item for each protocol state record.  So, for each issuing of a credential, the credential exchange record is stored completely for the full sequence of calls (offer, request, issue), which is quite a lot of data.  We are trying a few things to deal with that:

- deleting the protocol records after the protocol completes, where it makes sense for our use case
- reducing the data that we are collecting in the protocol record as the state of the protocol instance moves forward.  For example, after the Offer-Credential message is processed and the Request-Credential message is sent, the data about the Offer can be reduced/eliminated as we no longer need it.

Both of those somewhat depend on the use case (e.g. the need for auditing) so we are looking at ways to make that configurable if it makes sense.  Our use case we don't need that, so we are just using methods to minimize storage.

@cam-parra - this note might be of interest to you.

@kdenhartog and co. Hi, I've got a bit of a time-limited "emergency" where I need to get `git clone https://github.com/kdenhartog/indy-dev.git` to build ...and I'm running into an `E: There were unauthenticated packages and -y was used without --allow-unauthenticated` issue when `indy_pool` is being built...

hey guys 
i dont understand the documentation for

                            options_json: str) -> str:```

```
    Get an wallet record by id

    :param wallet_handle: wallet handler (created by open_wallet).
    :param type_: allows to separate different record types collections
    :param id: the id of record
    :param options_json: //TODO: FIXME: Think about replacing by bitmask

```
</p>
<p><strong>VithushanJegatheeswaran</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 09:40:48 GMT):<br/>
what is `type_` and `id`
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 09:41:40 GMT):<br/>
I guess type is ConnectionRecord or CredentialRecord etc
</p>
<p><strong>VithushanJegatheeswaran</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 09:41:44 GMT):<br/>
where do i get these information ?
I already have `wallet_handle`
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 09:41:49 GMT):<br/>
id is the primary key
</p>
<p><strong>VithushanJegatheeswaran</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 09:42:25 GMT):<br/>
primary key  of what ? :D sorry I'm new to all of this 
</p>
<p><strong>VithushanJegatheeswaran</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 09:43:05 GMT):<br/>
... and there is no example code for this function :D
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 09:45:33 GMT):<br/>
for the wallet record..
</p>
<p><strong>VithushanJegatheeswaran</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 09:47:27 GMT):<br/>
hmm ok .. 
is there a function which list all the data/content of a wallet ?
</p>
<p><strong>VithushanJegatheeswaran</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 09:49:22 GMT):<br/>
I just want to check if i recieved a `verifiable claim` or not

These are non-secret records - neither credentials nor cred defs nor schemas, etc. You can search non-secret records with empty filters to get all non-secret records (e.g., https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/aa6da11c5385a79e038cec4942b37b25883da914/wrappers/python/tests/non_secrets/test_wallet_search.py#L46). But this search won't find credentials, only non-secret records.

Hi, we are working on a Hyperledger Indy project. Have followed the demo on https://github.com/hyperledger/education/tree/master/LFS171x/indy-material/nodejs. The demo works perfectly but runs the application on different ports for different users. Is it possible that the agents run on different ports but the application can run one a single port. On login, it can connect to the agent port required.

This error code means WalletItemNotFound. If I understand the Rust code  in `create_pairwise`, the wallet tries to find dids and that's what probably throws an error. Have you created theses dids by `createAndStoreMyDid` or similar before calling createPairwise?

What version of libindy are you using? Can you enable logs and share the output?

You should be able to enable logs by adding the following to your python script:
```
import logging
logging.getLogger('indy').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 15:12:03 GMT):<br/>
Did you write the schema to the ledger, then read it back to get the sequence number before creating the cred def? If not, the cred def id will be in long format (`issuer-did:3:origin-did:schema-name:schema-version:cred-def-tag`) rather than in short format (`issuer-did:3:schema-seq-no:cred-def-tag`). Perhaps some processing further down the line assumes the more typical short format, but I the long format is also licit, accommodated here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/da4da126c5fb81fa2bb2d6b8215374a8e53ce73a/libindy/src/commands/anoncreds/issuer.rs#L353.

To get back the cred def id short format on cred def write, be sure to request and parse the schema from the ledger before creating a cred def on its transaction number.

To get back the cred def id short format on cred def write, be sure to request and parse the schema from the ledger before creating a cred def on its transaction number.

I recently worked through some similar issues to what you are mentioning @sklump. What you are saying is a bit confusing to me, so maybe its not related, but I thought I would mention my experience since it is at least close.
More details available if needed, but we had to make sure that "protocol_version" was set to 2 to get the "long version" of the cred_def_id, otherwise we would get the short version.  I am pretty sure the long version should be used for all recent versions of Indy (since moving to protocol_version 2 over a year ago). The problem we had was that "protocol_version" is not automatically set. To set it we had to either call ~"set_protocol_version" or connecting to a pool that had "protocol_version=2" would somehow set the version globally for us for future sdk calls. https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/libindy/src/domain/anoncreds/credential_definition.rs#L123
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Wed, 25 Sep 2019 16:24:43 GMT):<br/>
The protocol version refers to the ledger protocol. The code doesn't lie: the indy `IssuerCommandExecutor._prepare_create_and_store_credential_definition()` call tries to parse the schema seq number, and if it can't, substitutes the schema id.

`Did you read the schema from the ledger, then parse it get the sequence number before creating the cred def?`

This was the cause of my error. THANK YOU SO MUCH 

I created a Schema like this and got `license_schema_id  and license_schema`
```
(Company['license_schema_id'], Company['license_schema']) = \
    await anoncreds.issuer_create_schema(Company['did'], license['name'], license['version'],
                                         json.dumps(license['attributes']))
```
Then sent the Schema to Ledger

```
await send_schema(Company['pool'], Company['wallet'], Company['did'], Company['license_schema'])
time.sleep(1) 
```

My mistake was that I skipped the next step where I got the `license_schema_id  and license_schema` from the ledger.
I thought that I don't need to get these information from the ledger, since I already have them.


Here is the difference:


```
Before:
{"ver":"1.0","id":"DNRackiEMapJPxTvzGPWLW:2:License:1.2","name":"License","version":"1.2","attrNames":["ssn","status","degree","last_name","first_name","average","year"],"seqNo":null}
```

```
After:
{"ver":"1.0","id":"DNRackiEMapJPxTvzGPWLW:2:License:1.2","name":"License","version":"1.2","attrNames":["year","first_name","ssn","degree","average","status","last_name"],"seqNo":19}
```

The `seqNo` was set to `null` and caused the problem :D

This one Method solved the problem:
```
(Company['license_schema_id'], Company['license_schema']) = \
        await get_schema(Company['pool'], Company['did'], Company['license_schema_id'])
```

I overwrote/updated `license_schema` and got the missing `seqNo`

P.S. English is not my mother tongue; please excuse any errors on my part.

The schema can't have a sequence number until it is written to the ledger, which is obvious when you think about it - but only stepping into the trap makes one think about it.

Your English is fine, carry on and good luck.

The referent is just a handle in the wallet uniquely identifying the credential.

<p><strong>Henrycoffin</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 14:49:22 GMT):<br/>
Hi everyone. I have a very general question surrounding the initial connection between an identity holder and an Issuer. Is there anything within Indy to help prove that the person trying to connect is in fact who they say they are? Interested to hear how others are dealing with this issue. 
</p>
<p><strong>VithushanJegatheeswaran</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 14:51:58 GMT):<br/>
I think ...
the holder encrypts the message with his private key and with the issuers public key 
</p>
<p><strong>VithushanJegatheeswaran</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 14:53:27 GMT):<br/>
then the issuer can decrypt the message using the holders public key --> that proves that the message is really coming from the holder 
</p>
<p><strong>Henrycoffin</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 15:02:41 GMT):<br/>
Does that not just prove that the message is coming form the person claiming to be the holder? I understand how everything works once that pairwise connection has been established. It's just the implementation of that initial connection that I need to get my head around. (mainly so I can explain it to business people). If the answer is that we would have to follow any existing KYC process then that is obviously fine. I was just wondering if Indy provided anything that would prevent a bad actor from being able to create a connection and be issued with a credential? I appreciate this is probably a real edge case and I struggle to think of scenarios where this might happen but, I need to provide assurances to the business.
</p>
<p><strong>sklump</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 15:03:27 GMT):<br/>
But the (putative) holder's private key (and DID) are not public, and can be anything. So can the (putative) issuer's. Only when the holder verifies the credential offer does the holder have any confidence that the issuer controls the private key as anchored on the ledger. At least this is as far as I understand at this time.

As far as the issuer knowing the holder's identity, off-line processes have to vet. E.g., present proof of foundational identity.

Hi @bansatya, There are a few reasons why the pool might not connect. The first thing I would look at is your genesis file.  Check to make sure that the ip addresses and ports listed in there are correct and that your firewall is configured correctly.

hello, I am studying indy for hours but I ended up being totally lost :( All I am trying to do is a simple website in php/html that will utilize indy to provide identities (DIDs)...

<p><strong>DibbsZA</strong> (Wed, 09 Oct 2019 12:29:52 GMT):<br/>
As I understand the question, the answer is NO to both.
Once data is shared, it is shared and I don't see a way for data to magically dissapear on expiry. 
Whether the data is legally *CONSIDERED VALID* & *CONSENTED* is a different matter, and one that can only be resolved in the offline world (courts)
</p>
<p><strong>DibbsZA</strong> (Wed, 09 Oct 2019 12:33:02 GMT):<br/>
Also I think there would be legal rights of the doctor to retain that information if they had rendered any medical advice or services based on the information.

You are getting in pretty deep now :) I would need to have several more details to be able to make suggestions.  To begin with: Where are your nodes hosted? (locally?, multiple remote machines?, Docker?) Are the nodes in your genesis file able to communicate with each other (run `sudo validator-info` from each nodes command prompt) ? If you can ping (or netcat) all of your nodes IP addresses/ports from the client using the values in the genesis file, then post your genesis file here and I can have a look to see if I see any obvious problems.

No, creating a "Sovrin Steward" DID (user) is not required to be able to use a Sovrin network.  Creating a Sovrin Steward user is only required for Sovrin Stewards.  This is because each Steward is required to host a validator node in one of the Sovrin Networks.  In the past, the steward role could do more than just host a node, but with recent changes, the steward role does not have any other privileges on a Sovrin network.

Generically, each node in a default indy network must be added by a different steward DID so you will need at least one per node.

</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 08:03:20 GMT):<br/>
well if u use the same identifier everywhere, u can get data from diff sites and co-relate this data to create a persona. For example u interact with Bank B with identifier 1 and Bank B also with identifier 1. Then someone can co-relate and find out you have loan from Bank A and indurance from Bank B. Hope I am making sense

<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 16:07:28 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the details.  The files look like they are correct.  A couple of possible issues I see are
1. The validator-info outputs show that all nodes are stopped. Were they running when you saw the error? 
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 16:09:26 GMT):<br/>
2. One thing you said made me wonder if the files you sent match the similar files on your nodes.  I am pretty sure that the nodes pool_transaction_genesis file needs to match what you are using in the client for it to work 
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 16:25:37 GMT):<br/>
3. Another issue you might be having is that the <IP ADDRESS>es that are in your pool file need to be the Public addresses (I have seen people mistakenly use private IP's here)

Hi, I have a general question about management of Wallets. Currently they are only accessible via an Agent (Cloud or Edge). They are possibly encrypted through the owner's key-phrase. What if the Agent becomes unavailable? Is there a way to regenerate a Wallet from nothing? Is there a built in way to share/copy/move a Wallet from one Agent to another?
</p>
<p><strong>dbluhm</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 23:38:50 GMT):<br/>
You bring up several related but distinct topics: identity recovery, wallet backup, synchronizing wallets across multiple agents, and wallet portability. Each topic is fairly deep and the solutions for them are in varying stages of implementation. Plans and designs for identity recovery can be found in the [DKMS RFC](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0051-dkms/README.md). [A fairly detailed discussion on wallet backup and portability](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/aries?msg=8Lno4JQa2MQKNALCt) recently occurred in the #aries channel. Wallet synchronization is something we know we want but specific implementations have not yet been made. We anticipate potentially relying on the services something like a DIF Identity Hub. For more conceptual details on how we think that could happen, you might find this [article on the similarities and differences of DIF Identity Hubs and Agents](https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/rhythm-and-melody-how-hubs-and-agents-rock-together-ac2dd6bf8cf4) interesting.

The nodes are running on a separate remote machine at the time of error.
The pool genesis file is same at node and client i have checked that too earlier only 
And the IP address which i am using is not private as well  
</p>
<p><strong>manavgupta</strong> (Fri, 11 Oct 2019 03:41:52 GMT):<br/>
When i start the nodes by default process of indy node on that machine and tries to connect client from different machine then the client gets connected but in the case of custom genesis it doses not 
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Fri, 11 Oct 2019 03:44:19 GMT):<br/>
Looks like you have covered all of the common cases...  Maybe send a copy of the pool genesis file that works for comparison? Sorry, but i am running out of suggestions.
</p>
<p><strong>manavgupta</strong> (Fri, 11 Oct 2019 03:44:31 GMT):<br/>
And one thing in the second point you said the file should match with the client, which means the genesis transaction we give in pool config ledger? 
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Fri, 11 Oct 2019 03:48:04 GMT):<br/>
The pool genesis file you use for client connection, should match the one you had on the nodes when you started the network pool. (/var/lib/indy/<networkname>/pool_transactions_genesis)
</p>

At a quick glance, that looks like it matches the pool genesis you sent earlier. I will look at it a little bit more. Can you send a copy of the pool file that worked? (the one that was used when you started the pool "by a default process" as you mentioned earlier)

Is my understanding of the public ledger correct?
- Does not store any private data
- Is decentralized and therefore many instances
- Must be able to sync with other Trusted instances
- Issuers are the only ones who write to the public ledger

- Does not store any private data

- Must be able to sync with other Trusted instances
- Issuers are the only ones who write to the public ledger
- Agents read from the public ledger to update their own information which allows them to verify Credentials

Hi everyone! I am starting to work on an SSI project to obtain my university degree

So, knowing about Sovrin, I would like to confirm if I need to develop the blockchain under Indy architecture  or just integrate to Sovrin and develop the agents/wallets

logger.info("\"Alice\" -> Send authcrypted \"Job-Certificate\" Credential Request to Acme")
    alice['job_certificate_cred_values'] = json.dumps({

</p>
<p><strong>liormargalit</strong> (Sun, 13 Oct 2019 19:15:38 GMT):<br/>
It does not make sense, why would alice provide the values to acme?

I've read this docs but I'm not clear about in which scenario is better for build my own ledger or if a better solution goes to Sovrin ledger

<p><strong>DibbsZA</strong> (Mon, 14 Oct 2019 11:05:16 GMT):<br/>
Well I don't know. To me, building another blockchain before you can build solutions that people will use seems like extra work. :grin: 
Then again, if your university studies is all about the details of blockchain, crypto and distributed systems, then it may not be extra effort.

Hi, 
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Mon, 14 Oct 2019 15:11:42 GMT):<br/>
I would highly advise to only maintain your own network if you have expertise with Indy. It's not your average blockchain and it can be quite hard to wrestle with when things go wrong (not often but nothing is perfect).  @lynn.bendixsen is the Sovrin Networks maintainer and has a deeper knowledge than I do about maintaining a production network. I am sure if you ask nicely he can give you some pointers

Hi, any good source material around credential schemas and schema definitions?
</p>
<p><strong>Fosol</strong> (Tue, 15 Oct 2019 15:58:04 GMT):<br/>
Where can I read up on how the ledger is distributed and remains in sync between instances?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 15 Oct 2019 16:11:35 GMT):<br/>
That is the indy-node repo, and the #indy-node channel in rocketchat.

I suggest to gather logs from libindy and then we can analyze it
</p>
<p><strong>manavgupta</strong> (Wed, 16 Oct 2019 05:39:48 GMT):<br/>
which logs are you talking about?

I'm running 4 nodes inside of a docker container and exposing the ports (9701-9708)
Now I tried to replace the IP addresses in the genesis file to my local IP address.
some how I can't connect to the nodes ... did anyone faced the same issue ?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 17:00:40 GMT):<br/>
Use the libindy code as a model and write your own?

You can reference the `transactions.md` file in Indy Node which can be found here https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/transactions.md.

 Additionally, there's a node-js implementation that can be found here. https://github.com/Picolab/node-indy-request

Hello everyone. I was able to successfully get an Indy Pool up and running in my IBM cloud Virtual machine using this article: https://medium.com/@smaldeniya/setup-hyperledger-indy-pool-in-local-linux-environment-using-docker-304d13eb86dc.

I now want to communicate to the indy pool using a Java API agent using the IndySDK: Java.

My question is there a resource or How To for connecting to a remote pool? As a best practice I also set up nginx https and certbot. Does anyone know how to route Nginx to the internal docker hosted ports?

I understand Indy has moved to Ursa so is indy-crypto still used at all?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 14:01:49 GMT):<br/>
the repo points to the wiki for info on the relationship between the different repos but unfortunately it seems a bit out of date and doesn't even reference indy-crypto

</p>
<p><strong>donqui</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 14:45:05 GMT):<br/>
`indy-crypto` is still used in `indy-plenum`. `indy-sdk` has migrated to Ursa completely, and we have a PR open for moving `indy-plenum` to it as well, so `indy-crypto` will not be used anymore after that.
</p>

Hello, I am new to this channel and need some help.
I wrote a Backend with VCX (Java-Wrapper). It runs on my server with the Dummy Cloud Agent which listens to port 8070 and 8071.
The connection between Backend and Cloud Agent works fine.
I am using the open source connector-app to scan the generated QR-code to get a connection with the Cloud Agent.
The problem is that, after scanning the code, it runs into a timeout (Failed to connect). I configured the agency-did, -verkey, -endpoint and poolconfig in the developer mode of the app.
The Dummy Cloud Agent runs on localhost:8070. I have an nginx configuration that maps requests from <mydomain>.com/agency/ to localhost:8070.
When I browse for "<mydomain>.com/agency/" in my browser it shows did and verkey from the Cloud Agent. That means that I can reach it but the app somehow can't.
Does anyone know that problem?
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Thu, 24 Oct 2019 12:48:57 GMT):<br/>
@Philippede 2 two things come in my mind:
1. Are you running agency on HTTPS? Try without, don't, dummy cloud agent doesn't support that (I am not sure if that can be issue in case there's only 1 agency)
2. Have you set up `forward_agent.endpoint` in agency config file? It should have value of `http://<mydomain>.com`, where the agency resides. Check the content of the QR code to see what address is the connection invitation pointing to

I've been following some getting started guides for indy-sdk, but I've run into an issue with pool timeouts.

I set up my pool using this guide:
https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/sdk/en/latest/docs/getting-started/run-getting-started.html

And have run various examples in:
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/samples

As far as I can tell the indy_pool docker container is running and the ports are open. It seems that I can't access them with localhost (or 0.0.0.0), but I've set the TEST_POOL_ID environment variable to the correct ip address, and it's being pulled in the various apps correctly. I clear the ~/.indy_client/ before runs. I can't think of what else might be the cause. I've been having trouble debugging due to the async calls being made as it gets down into the libindy code.

Any thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>Philippede 2</strong> (Fri, 25 Oct 2019 07:56:51 GMT):<br/>
The agency was running on HTTPS but with HTTP I get the same error. The endpoint is set correctly.
In the react-native debugger I found out that the app cannot initialize VCX for some reason (VCX_INIT_FAIL: CS-002 Failed to init vcx: VCX Exception).

<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Fri, 25 Oct 2019 17:10:31 GMT):<br/>
Sorry, that was meant to be a separate issue question to the general group here.  What I meant was that the indy-node tried to start and failed and then tried a few more times but did not stay running.  The issue turned out to be that the node had a year+ old genesis file that was in an old format.  When we replaced it with the current genesis files, it worked fine.
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Fri, 25 Oct 2019 17:17:12 GMT):<br/>
Hi @chuda It looks like the best place for you to start is with https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk in the "How to start local nodes pool with docker" section of the main readme. If you have already tried that and have some more specific questions or problems with running nodes on different machines, then let me know and I can help more.

</p>
<p><strong>donqui</strong> (Sun, 27 Oct 2019 18:52:12 GMT):<br/>
hm, I am confused about that line...

I don't think you have to have any special dirs. If you are on Ubuntu I think you only need to copy the `.so` to `/usr/local/lib` and try the wrapper.

If you get a NullPointerException I might be wrong :)

</p>
<p><strong>donqui</strong> (Sun, 27 Oct 2019 18:56:03 GMT):<br/>
then I think you only need to place the `.so` on your LIBRARY_PATH
</p>
<p><strong>donqui</strong> (Sun, 27 Oct 2019 18:56:20 GMT):<br/>
so that the wrapper tries to load it by name, the OS can find it on the system
</p>

You are a bit beyond my experience level at that point, I am afraid, but I will add one more thing to try before I let the experts help you.  There was a time a few months ago where I built a .dylib on Mac (a different indy related library) and because something trying to use it was looking for a .so I simply copied the x.dylib to x.so in the same directory and it worked!  (Disclaimer: This is not a great long term solution because 1. you have to remember to copy the lib every time you build, and 2. its obviously not meant to work in this klugey way)
</p>
<p><strong>droconnel22</strong> (Tue, 29 Oct 2019 00:12:49 GMT):<br/>
@lynn.bendixsen ok that might work - thanks x100 for the help

hi guys I am new to indy. I have create docker image *indy-pool* from the `indy-sdk/ci` repo. I created a pool. when I try to connect to the pool i am thrown *Invalid library state: Ledger merkle tree doesn't acceptable for current tree.* error

<p><strong>manavgupta</strong> (Tue, 29 Oct 2019 10:14:18 GMT):<br/>
Hi @hyper-sunder the error which you are getting is due to pool genesis mismatch i.e. the pool genesis for client and indy pool is not same. So make sure they are same and it will work for you. Even the IP address in the pool genesis should be same.

Create_pool creates a local pool name that references the remote pool, then you use that name to open the pool (i.e. connect to it). The verbiage is a bit confusing, so keep asking if you need more explanation

Hey guys,

I am having issues with the iOS SDK, it relates to the following: https://forum.sovrin.org/t/ios-indy-sdk-image-not-found/1306

It may be an issue with the newer versions of XCode. A logic next step would be to downgrade XCode to an older version, but that may not be the best approach for a long term solution.

Is there any chance a new version of the libindy-objc will be released? That is compatible with newer versions of XCode?

@pedreviljoen This has been a lingering issue for a while. Your best bet right is to build Indy.Framework yourself, by manually replacing the libindy-objc pod files. This means you would have to `cargo build` libindy with iOS targets, which actually isn't very complex.

I'm sorry that I don't know the answer to your question. But I am curious about your use case. Are you using LibVCX in a new project? Why are you using LibVCX instead of one of the Aries libraries?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 20:43:51 GMT):<br/>
My guess is that you are referring to Connect.Me, which is Evernym's commercial identity wallet.
See: https://www.evernym.com/products/
And: https://try.connect.me/

@Philippede 2 one more wild guess. You say you can access the agency verkey/did from localhost in browser. What's the URL you can see this data? is it `http://<mydomain>.com/agency`  or `http://<mydomain>.com/agency/` ?
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 09:08:47 GMT):<br/>
It must be `http://<mydomain>.com/agency`

</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 09:29:18 GMT):<br/>
Well seems like you have too recent version of libsodium. Try `brew uninstall libsodium`, then if there's no errors `brew install libsodium@1.0.12`
</p>
<p><strong>hyper-sunder</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 09:32:51 GMT):<br/>
sorry to bother more
</p>
<p><strong>hyper-sunder</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 09:32:55 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 09:36:37 GMT):<br/>
no problem, just gotta find out how to list available versions on brew and figure out which to install. Before that, can you verify that `ls /usr/local/opt/libsodium/lib` no longer contains the dylib file after you run the uninstall?
</p>
<p><strong>hyper-sunder</strong> (Mon, 04 Nov 2019 09:38:05 GMT):<br/>
thanks.... let me try. brew search libsodium lists only 1.0.18 :cry:

As per proof-of-non-revocation (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0011-cred-revocation#presenting-proof-of-non-revocation):

The prover can calculate an updated witness u by finding the product of all of the non-revoked entries in the tails file and excluding its own entry. The Prover also knows its own factor, b, because it was given its entry's index in the tails file, and can calculate u*b = e, where e is the accumulator. 
The prover then uses zero knowledge proof to prove to the issuer that he knows u and b using product proofs.

Now let’s say the prover has 2 credential definitions, one which is revoked and one which is not. My question is what stops the prover to use u and b from the credential definition that was not revoked while sharing a credential definition that was revoked.

Example: Let’s say a prover has a driving license and a university degree from a same issuer. Then the issuer revokes the driving license but not the university degree. In this case while sharing driving license with the verifier the prover also shares u and b values of university degree and not driving license (since driving licence was revoked).

Hi, as per the official demo of Indy, we have a separate port for each agent of Indy. However, this does not look scalable. Can someone help me with a strategy to allow unlimited users in Indy.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 14:51:37 GMT):<br/>
I don't understand your question. You want to run a separate agent for each of your users, but do it on the same machine?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 14:51:52 GMT):<br/>
There is no inherent limit to the number of users in Indy.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 05 Nov 2019 14:52:23 GMT):<br/>
But scaling up your agent infrastructure can be a challenge. However it's not inherently different then scaling up multiple instances of any other software.

I don't believe that we have had a backwards incompatible release since before 1.8 (start of the year), so any recent release should work. In general, I recommend using the latest release of LibIndy and LibVCX. Once the Sovrin Network starts enforcing the Transaction Author Agreement, you will need to be on a release that supports it, which is 1.9.0 or above (May 2019).

<p><strong>DibbsZA</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 06:28:39 GMT):<br/>
@nitika-goel The current agent architectures (which manage their own wallets) mostly require seperate instances.

I have just put an API gateway in front of all of mine to limit public port (I am using hostname or path routing on the gateway). 

Spaceman.id have a custom multi-tennant wallet/agent solution, which I gather uses url/post parameters to open/close access to different wallet stores.

HI,
I am exploring LibVCX and able to run Alice-Faber demo by running dummy agent separately. If I  build my own custom application how can we handle the agent communication. 
Does Indy provides any agent or library to be consumed separately? Can you guys please clarify. I am not getting much about agent and agent2agent communication in wiki.

</p>
<p><strong>donqui</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 12:18:24 GMT):<br/>
Indy does not provide any agent libraries, you can take a look at #aries if you are interested in this. It is still work in progress but there are some frameworks and consumable agents (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python)  
</p>
<p><strong>bansatya</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 13:02:58 GMT):<br/>
@donqui , Thanks. So, implementing custom applications , if we need to establish communication, we need to use an agent separately? Apologies, if it's not making any sense, I am very new to Llibvcx/Indy. 
</p>
<p><strong>donqui</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 13:04:19 GMT):<br/>
If you need to build an app, you need to either:
1. take libvcx and use its methods to build what you need
2. take an already built agent and just make it behave in the way you want
</p>
<p><strong>donqui</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 13:05:34 GMT):<br/>
So if you build a custom app, you would manage all of the communication throught libvcx, or some other framework 
</p>
<p><strong>donqui</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 13:05:55 GMT):<br/>
or you would consume an agent lib that you will just use to manage that communication for you
</p>

```
but I cant set the last two parameters as `undefined`
</p>
<p><strong>donqui</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 13:07:13 GMT):<br/>
#aries is the project aimed at building interoperable agents, so you might look at that
</p>
<p><strong>donqui</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 13:07:42 GMT):<br/>
libvcx works now, and you can build things with it, but aries will be the future of this kind of development
</p>
<p><strong>bansatya</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 13:10:19 GMT):<br/>
@donqui , Thanks a lot. So, As I understood , through libvcx, I can create inter operable agents. But, then another question, why Alice-faber demo  needs a dummy agents run separately  though the python script use libvcx.

</p>
<p><strong>donqui</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 13:14:01 GMT):<br/>
the way libvcx is written it depends on another type of agent, a cloud agent in order to deliver messages to recipients. It dos not support direct Edge 2 Edge communication. Dummy agent acts as that Cloud Agent

This is the funtion definition:
```
indy.issuerCreateCredential = function issuerCreateCredential (wh, credOffer, credReq, credValues, revRegId, blobStorageReaderHandle, cb) {
  cb = wrapIndyCallback(cb, function (data) {
    return [fromJson(data[0]), data[1], fromJson(data[2])]
  })
  capi.issuerCreateCredential(wh, toJson(credOffer), toJson(credReq), toJson(credValues), revRegId, blobStorageReaderHandle, cb)
  return cb.promise
}
```

Hello,
I am currently working with Indy and I am trying to implement for my use case. I have different people from different organizations that exchange documents that have to be signed and approved by other people and i would like to store these claims in wallets of different organizations. My idea is that each organization has a wallet where it can see all the approved and signed documents from other organizations. But i would like to keep the signatures and hash data also in a project but it is not accessible to everyone. Should i include it in a schema of a proof? Or is it not the common practice in Indy?

Hey guys, 

I am very new to Hyperledger Indy. Can anyone tell me from where to start? I have read the use-case and example of Alice. I was reading the official documentation "read the docs".  Most of the links are broken. Can anyone tell me from where I can start?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 14:59:46 GMT):<br/>
I'm a little bias, since I wrote a lot of this :-), but suggest you start here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/tree/master/docs/GettingStartedAriesDev

It begins with the content from an edX course on Indy that was available last year, covering the identity challenges on the Internet and then how Indy addresses those issues. We've expanded that content and will be launching a new edX course coming Real Soon (Nov. 21 launch is currently planned), so that will be another good resource once that starts.  We're starting on an Aries Developer edX course that we hope launch in early 2020.

Hi Gaila,
you can use any encrypted storage or you can also store these details in an Indy/Identity Wallet without mentioning them in any schema using the non-secrets API. 
you can have a look here:
https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/sdk/en/latest/docs/design/003-wallet-storage/README.html
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Fri, 08 Nov 2019 10:15:18 GMT):<br/>
Hi @nikita-goel, I am guessing that you want to make multiple wallets not agents. every user will be having one unique wallet which then will be used to support various Indy operations. you can create unlimited number of wallets using a single agent. In case you want to know more about agents, wallets etc. feel free to drop me a DM.

Hi all, I have recently started looking at Indy and I was wondering if someone might be able to help me understand some points about proof negotiation. I have been looking at this RFC (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0037-present-proof), and have a few queries about the _cred_def_id_. From my current understanding, a credentialDefinition is required for every issuer who wishes to issue a credential for a particular schema. When a verifier requests proof does this mean that they have to ask for a specific definition of the credential in the proof? Is there any way to request proof that the holder owns a credential for a particular schema without specifying the actual definition of the schema? 
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Fri, 08 Nov 2019 15:13:24 GMT):<br/>
Hi, how I understand this is as follows:-  a credential definition is unique per issuer and the definition id also holds the public did if the issuer. An issuer creates a credential definition from a schema. A verifier introduces a human trust element by adding a restriction in its proof request by adding a list of cred_def_id. Which generally translates that a verifier is trusting a list of issuers. A credential from the same schema but issued by a different issuer not in list in the cred def id provided by the verifier is not acceptable by the verifier. A verifier can also add a restriction of schema name and schema version
</p>
<p><strong>sam.morrison</strong> (Fri, 08 Nov 2019 16:47:59 GMT):<br/>
@sukalpomitra thanks, that helps a lot. From the spec I was reading that as a single cred_def_id...but having a list makes sense. Just to confirm, in the indy implementation I could use something like this when creating the proof:

```
      ....
      'attr3_referent': {
        'name': 'degree',
        'restrictions': [
           {'cred_def_id': faberTranscriptCredDefId}
           {'cred_def_id': someOtherTranscriptCredDefId}
        ]
      },
     ....
```

As an aside, are there any indy docs that provide more details of the format of the proof request other than the spec linked above?
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Fri, 08 Nov 2019 16:52:01 GMT):<br/>
Your understanding is correct but your json structure is wrong It will look something like this ```{\"name\": \"Age Proof\", \"version\": \"1.0\", \"nonce\": \"161176543312099780664559294393629608879\", \"requested_attributes\": {\"390f4a3e-30ab-430f-a5cc-7b0aebd2c9a6\": {\"name\": \"fname\", \"restrictions\": [{\"cred_def_id\": \"8eTQrWPnXgk8iCGtC54xPC:3:CL:635:default\"}, {\"cred_def_id\": \"8eTQrWPnXgk8iCGtC54xPC:3:CL:705:default\"}]}}, \"requested_predicates\": {\"42b0837b-87a5-4a36-8cfe-2e524c31492a\": {\"name\": \"age\", \"restrictions\": [{\"cred_def_id\": \"8eTQrWPnXgk8iCGtC54xPC:3:CL:705:default\"}], \"p_type\": \">=\", \"p_value\": \"21\"}}}"```

Hi Guys, I am facing issue while using libvcx nodejs wrapper(Dynamic Symbol Retrieval Error: /usr/lib/libvcx.so: undefined symbol: vcx_update_webhook_url) - libvcx.so r in place and the function seems to be there. not sure whether version issues. Anyone faced this short of issues?
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Sat, 09 Nov 2019 08:32:12 GMT):<br/>
The symbol represents function added on latest (or very recent) master branch of libvcx. You either recompile libvcx library on your system, or use slightly older version of libvcx wrapper (a revision where the function is not yet present). In conclusion, you need to make sure inysdk binaries on your system are compatible with wrapper you are using).

2) Where are `proverDid` and `issuerDid` coming from ? I tried to repace them with some random strings but got an error. 
3) apparently nothing is stored on the ledger. Do I even need the ledger then / what is the purpose of it?

Thank you in advance :)

Hi, I have a strong Ethereum background and kinda like the crypto side of blockchain and I've been hunting the private keys from did's and how to access them from my wallet. My goal is to create a PoC that communicates directly to the node without indy-sdk (just for curiosity). I was forwarded to this (amazing) repo https://github.com/Picolab/node-indy-request but I need some real private keys to start using this approach. 
How can I access the private keys inside my wallet? (through indy-cli)
Thanks guys, sorry if it's a silly/inappropriate question.

You can use `wallet export` to export the entire contents of the wallet to a file.  You would then need to decrypt the contents of the exported file, and I don't know how to do that.

Hi. When I try to connect to my Cloud Agent that runs on a public IP address I run into a Pool timeout. I captured the traffic with wireshark and it seems like it connects to the right Ports (9701-9708). The client sends a "Hello" and gets back a "Welcome", then sends a "INITIATE" and gets back a "Ready", then sends a "MESSAGE". After this the client keeps sending a TCP retransmission until it resets the TCP connection. Locally, everything works fine. Can someone help me fixing this problem? Thanks!

When you export it you provide a key. I think you just need to  use that same key for importing it.
</p>
<p><strong>donqui</strong> (Wed, 13 Nov 2019 12:19:08 GMT):<br/>
If you just want to decrypt it without importing it so you have a export file in clear text, please take a look at how that is done in the wallet export/import logic of indy-sdk code.

Hi all, I am new to hyperledger projects and wanted to use indy. I have a mac and tried to install the sdk but couldn't start the cli. It says
└─> ./indy-cli
dyld: Library not loaded: /Users/jenkins/workspace/indy-sdk_indy-sdk-cd_rc/libindy/target/release/deps/libindy.dylib
I followed the steps to download all stable builds and updated the LIBRARY_PATH accordingly
but it seems the cli points to some other location for libindy binary
can someone help as to how to run the given alice example
I dont know if this is the right platform to asks such question. If not, can someone point me in the right direction

Is it possible to get a credential from an issuer without revealing any information. 
</p>
<p><strong>VithushanJegatheeswaran</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 00:05:07 GMT):<br/>
Is it possible to get a credential from an issuer without revealing any information.  For example if Alice want a verifiable credential from Bob that she is over 18. Bob needs to know her date of birth and name or some kind of knowledge that the claim is true right ? Is there a way to get a credential anonymously ?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 00:50:57 GMT):<br/>
No - the issuer is supposed to be someone that knows something about - is an authority.  Alice doesn't ask a random person (Bob) to say she is over 18, she asks an authority (e.g. a gov't) that is trusted to issue her a credential that has her DoBirth as a claim in the credential.  Then, when a verifier asks her to prove she is over 18, she can present a proof that includes a "true" for an "over 18 predicate" based on her DoBirth in the credential she has, without revealing to the verifier her DoBirth (or anything else).  The verifier will know:

1. Who issued the credential that has the DoBirth claim in it.
2. That it was issued to Alice (the person being asked).
3. That the data has not been tampered with.
4. That the credential from which the claim was taken has not been revoked.


5. That she is over 18.

<p><strong>VithushanJegatheeswaran</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 08:57:50 GMT):<br/>
For my bachelor's thesis I would like to create an anonymous voting system based on DID's. For example, employees of a company can vote their new works works council. 
</p>
<p><strong>VithushanJegatheeswaran</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 09:03:13 GMT):<br/>
Each employee would get a verifiable credential that they are actually working for the company. They can use that credential to authenticate themselves and get redirect to the voting screen. To prevent double voting, the did of the voter is  stored In a database.  My questions would be:  who issues the claim ? How can I make sure that everything is anonymous? Are DID's the right way or is this impossible?

Hey Guys
Does anybody have the current Node-Versions that sovrin is using in there Builder/Staging/MainNet
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:51:33 GMT):<br/>
I don't think in Indy there is a way to do this.  There is a mechanism that has been discussed for how this could be done, but it requires a feature not yet in Indy.
</p>
<p><strong>donqui</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:54:45 GMT):<br/>
one way is to use this https://indyscan.io/home/sovmain, checkout the config ledger and look at the latest NODE_UPGRADE TXN

<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:59:02 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran if the voting is done through the established connection, wont it be achieved? the backend of the voting system can be developed in a way so that the voting results are kept separate and who has voted is checked through a flag. That way the flag helps in preventing double voting, while a fact table just shows the voting counts anonymously
</p>
<p><strong>donqui</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 16:01:52 GMT):<br/>
@lynn.bendixsen maybe you know an easier way to get insight into the current version of packages deployed on Sovrin?
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 16:18:57 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the answer, i actually did this and came up with the following if somebody is interested:

(Take no responsibility :P)
MainNet:  1.1.58 -> IndyNode: 1.10.0
StagingNet: 1.1.60 -> IndyNode: 1.11.0
BuilderNet: 1.1.56 -> IndyNode: 1.9.2
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 16:21:00 GMT):<br/>
There are ways if you have an identifier per person, but of course that leaves it open to collusion. The tricky part is being able to do it without that, so there is no chance of being identified.
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 22:22:14 GMT):<br/>
The Sovrin BuilderNet info is not up-to-date on indyscan.io.  We did a Reset on that Network a few months ago, but indyscan did not do a similar reset.  The current versions for BuilderNet are the same as StagingNet. Sovrin : 1.1.60 -> IndyNode 1.11.0
I know of an easier way for Stewards and Trustees to get the current versions of packages deployed, but nothing better than what was suggested for other users. 
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 22:40:56 GMT):<br/>
@channel Does anyone know who is the maintainer of indyscan.io? I need to get them a message about our somewhat recent reset of the Sovrin BuilderNet so that they can also do a reset.
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 23:14:21 GMT):<br/>
hmmm, looks like it is @PatrikStas  https://github.com/Patrik-Stas/indyscan
</p>
<p><strong>VithushanJegatheeswaran</strong> (Fri, 15 Nov 2019 10:10:06 GMT):<br/>
my idea would be to get a trusted third party involed as an issuer. He can issue the verifiable credential. The DID's and the vote would get logged. This way I can make sure that a user only votes once but I won't be able to associate the DID with the real Identity. 

Do you guys see any problems with this ?

I think that the Java wrapper is mature, and that that comment is just something that hasn't been deleted and is not valid. I also see people using Python and NodeJS wrappers quiter regularly so I would say that those should be a good choice.

Rust/Java/Python/NodeJS/Objective C are all equally active. They are maintained by the people working on the SDK and are tested aainst CI on every PR.

<p><strong>DibbsZA</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 12:42:56 GMT):<br/>
I think its important to clarify the language and the context before moving to deeper subject.
A *connection *is just a channel between two agents. At this level there is *no awareness of who/what exists beyond* the endpoints of that connection. Thus connection requests can be safely anonymous.

Now we are back where every authenticated website has to ask the user to provide something unique that they know that can be verified independantly by the website.
In my KYC scenario, the user provides their national ID number and a Selfie which is used in a call to our National Identity database for biometric comparison. On success I can Issue a NationalID credential to the user which they can use another time to do authentication .

They haven't yet established a policy for ledger resets of Builder Net and Staging Net, but they want everyone to know it could happen. The data there is not expected to be persistent over the long term.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:27:55 GMT):<br/>
The TAA on Builder Net was to test the system. They are working on the real TAA for Builder Net and expect to have one on Staging Net as well. The text hasn't been drafted yet.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:29:22 GMT):<br/>
I don't think they have ever reset Staging Net, but Builder Net has been reset when things got out-of-wack.

Hello, I am checking the use cases of hyperledger indy and I am interested in this one "Software Development Pipeline — Verify development builds were completed properly and officially signed by the developers for consumers of the software. This could also be useful because build credentials could be revoked if the software has a vulnerability informing consumers of the software, leading to very powerful decentralized security alert system" Can someone please explain how indy would help with it? And wouldn't be better to use, for example, fabric, to keep information about each build? 
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 20 Nov 2019 16:07:14 GMT):<br/>
The information about each build isn't kept on the ledger. The developer issues a credential that is distributed along with the build, and users of the build can verify it by referencing the keys on the blockchain.

Hi Team, Can anyone please differentiate between Steward and a trust anchor role in Sovrin? As per my understanding, steward is the one who takes responsibility of running a node of Sovrin, and trust anchor issues/verifies credentials. In order to do that, trust anchor will also have to run a node in Sovrin? So indirectly a trust anchor is also a steward ?  Can someone please give some inputs on this ?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 16:10:11 GMT):<br/>
For public instance of indy, you can use this - https://indyscan.io/home/sovmain

If you want to run your own network and have a browser for it, you can use this - https://github.com/bcgov/von-network

@sebastillar  - you dont need indycli to run a network but to interact with it. Easiest way is to use a docker image packaged with all the requirements. You can use an image from von. Here are the steps to get everything running https://github.com/bcgov/von-network#running-the-network-locally

for now as a workaround I am running the test pool in the same pod with the client. In case anyone else encounters this issue...
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Mon, 25 Nov 2019 14:19:18 GMT):<br/>
did you update the genesis-file, exposed the ports and so on?
</p>
<p><strong>liormargalit</strong> (Mon, 25 Nov 2019 14:25:51 GMT):<br/>
yes, I have set the TEST_POOL_IP env variable with the clusterIP (this env variable is used in pool_genesis_txn_data() in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/samples/python/src/utils.py 
</p>
<p><strong>liormargalit</strong> (Mon, 25 Nov 2019 14:26:00 GMT):<br/>
Also exposed the ports

the ports 9701-9708 in the service

should I have exposed 9709 either?

<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Mon, 25 Nov 2019 16:10:41 GMT):<br/>
did you check if the Env works?
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Mon, 25 Nov 2019 16:10:55 GMT):<br/>
and else just update the Docker-File and add the modified genesis 
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Mon, 25 Nov 2019 16:10:57 GMT):<br/>
could help

How can the issuer be sure that you are the person youre telling to be ? 
for example: The government wants to issue a credential that you are "Alice". But how can they be sure that you are really Alice ?

<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 26 Nov 2019 14:39:28 GMT):<br/>

Does the sovrin have some kind of bottlenecks? Because i want to get a cred-def from the ledger with a schema of 88 Attributes but i always get an Timeout. Any known "Bugs" or fixes for that Problem?
Already tried to fix it with the indy-cli or over the python-wrapper either got the cred-def. But its for sure on the Ledger (looked it up in indyscan)

</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:57:36 GMT):<br/>
Maybe check you cli version? I am running `1.11.1`
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:58:46 GMT):<br/>
Really Strange... it works with your "custom-command"
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:58:57 GMT):<br/>
but if i try it like that : `ledger get-cred-def schema_id=79461 signature_type=CL tag=tprm-tag1 origin=VmcAeAQ7D5eRyLWLMKD9oq`
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:58:59 GMT):<br/>
it does not
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:59:05 GMT):<br/>
try `ledger get-schema did=VmcAeAQ7D5eRyLWLMKD9oq name=tprm-demo version=1.0`
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:59:20 GMT):<br/>
ahha... yeah you want cred def, right
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:59:27 GMT):<br/>
correct
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:59:41 GMT):<br/>
and ya it works in my python script sometimes
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:59:57 GMT):<br/>
thats why i asked for some known bottlenecks
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 09:01:14 GMT):<br/>
yesterday we had no chance getting this
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 09:05:43 GMT):<br/>
What version of cli you are using? Cause on 1.11 the `get-cred-def` actually requires different parameters than what you have there
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 09:06:02 GMT):<br/>
fro `1.11 cli`:
```
Examples:
	ledger cred-def schema_id=1 signature_type=CL tag=1 primary={"n":"1","s":"2","rms":"3","r":{"age":"4","name":"5"},"rctxt":"6","z":"7"}
```
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 09:08:52 GMT):<br/>
the same with this command: `ledger custom {"reqId":1,"identifier":"LibindyDid111111111111","operation":{"type":"108","ref":79461,"signature_type":"CL","origin":"VmcAeAQ7D5eRyLWLMKD9oq","tag":"tprm-tag1"},"protocolVersion":2}`
I mean there is a limit of 125 Attributes when publishing(this works just fine), but could it be that you can only get cred-def(s) with around 50 Attributes because of some server-performance?
</p>

Hi guys, sorry if it's not the right place to ask this, but I didn't find anywhere better.
We have a proof request like this:
```
{
[...]
    "requested_attributes": {

           "restrictions": [{"cred_def_id": credDefIdShareGlobal}]
        }
    }
[...]
}

Is it possible to have multiple "cred_def_id" restrictions on the same attribute, like this: `"restrictions": [{"cred_def_id": CredDefId1}, {"cred_def_id": CredDefId2}]` ?
Thanks in advance!

<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 11:51:21 GMT):<br/>
I think the important things are Cred-Def-ID and Schema-ID to get everything, so you dont a "ready to use" credential offer since you can genrate that on the fly

I believe a credentialOffer is required first in Indy. It's part of the ZKP crypto - the issuer is commiting to what it is going to issue.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 27 Nov 2019 16:50:26 GMT):<br/>
Actually, I'm sure it's needed, and think that is why it is needed :-)
</p>
<p><strong>bansatya</strong> (Thu, 28 Nov 2019 07:03:55 GMT):<br/>
@sukalpomitra , you mean while mobile agent create connection with passport issuer, it will ask for some short of details? Can you please elaborate. How the trust will be built?   
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Thu, 28 Nov 2019 07:09:57 GMT):<br/>
The trust is in several layers. First there is trust in cryptography and blockchain. You hold the private key to prove that you own the public key that is in the did doc. When the credential is issued to the holder. It is signed by the issuer's public key. When the holder sends this credential to the verifier, it counter signs with its own public key also. Next trust comes from human level, where the verifier in the proof request can add restriction that they only accept credentrial from issuer A or Issuer B or both issuer A and B
</p>
<p><strong>bansatya</strong> (Thu, 28 Nov 2019 07:12:47 GMT):<br/>
@sukalpomitra , I understand the cryptographical trust. But question is on human trust. How passport issuer will be sure that Alice who is asking for credential is Alice and not other people?
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Thu, 28 Nov 2019 07:13:35 GMT):<br/>
because he trusts the issuer
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Thu, 28 Nov 2019 07:15:36 GMT):<br/>
thats what I said, how in today's world we do it. For Indians, we have VFS office where we go and submit all the relevant documents. They can also may be able to submit through an e-app. once VFS does their verification, the same offline process that they do today, they now can either issue a physical passport or issue a verifiable credential

Hi everyone! Is it correct that currently only _larger, smaller than_ ZKP s for integers are possible in indy? Thanks very much for any responses in advance!

<p><strong>brentzundel</strong> (Thu, 28 Nov 2019 12:06:46 GMT):<br/>
Yes, this is currently true. Work is underway to greatly expand the scope of predicate proofs, but it will not be in place until someone next year.

there is null (libnullpay - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/libnullpay), like a mock for testing. Also there is a plugin API so you can write your own

Hi! I'm looking for a way to do authorization and delegation and stumbled upon https://github.com/w3c/vc-data-model/issues/204 which led me to https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld. Is there a plan to publish capabilities and their invocations in the indy ledger?

Hi everyone! Can someone explain to me how a verifier can interact with the ledger if it doesn't have a wallet? 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 29 Nov 2019 16:05:27 GMT):<br/>
Initial work has started on delegation in Indy as described here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0104-delegatable-credentials
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 29 Nov 2019 16:08:58 GMT):<br/>
Not sure how you are using the term "wallet".  A verifier has to have an agent that can receive a proof and execute the crypto to verify the correctness of the proof. As well, it should have as part of the agent the ability to connect to and read transactions from the ledger related to the proof - the credential definition to know the DID of the issuer, for example, and if the credential is revocable, the revocation registry entries to confirm the "proof of non-revocation" that the prover would have included.

What role is the blockchain/pool playing with DID's ?

</p>
<p><strong>gnarula</strong> (Mon, 02 Dec 2019 13:40:28 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran to follow up, are there plans to log the _use_ of a delegated credential in the ledger for audibility? 
</p>
<p><strong>VithushanJegatheeswaran</strong> (Mon, 02 Dec 2019 13:46:56 GMT):<br/>
a user can create multiple DID's, but can he use the same verifiable crendetial across all his DID's ? 
</p>
<p><strong>VithushanJegatheeswaran</strong> (Mon, 02 Dec 2019 13:48:26 GMT):<br/>
can a VC get stolen/ can someone else use your VC in combination with their DID ? 
</p>
<p><strong>gnarula</strong> (Mon, 02 Dec 2019 13:55:15 GMT):<br/>
yes, and the secret sauce that makes it possible is the user being able to prove it knows a secret that the issuer blindly signed. idk how up to date this is but it explains the details pretty well https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/How-DIDs-Keys-Credentials-and-Agents-Work-Together-in-Sovrin-131118.pdf

I suspect that the genesis file that you are using for your CLI does not match the genesis file of the docker indy-pool.  They must be the same for you to be able to connect.

Is it possible to get attribute values from a proof in vcx? For example when I need to know the name of a person. The attribute values in a proof are encrypted and I didn't find a way to decrypt them.

<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 10:19:50 GMT):<br/>
I think you are just overlooking where they are =) It's a bit mess, but here's how you'd extract proof data in JS.  The parameter to this function is serialized vcx proof.
```
function extractProofData (serProof) {
  if ([1, 2].includes(serProof.data.proof_state) && serProof.data.state === 4) {
    const proof = JSON.parse(serProof.data.proof.libindy_proof)
    const attrs = proof.requested_proof.revealed_attrs
    const data = Object.keys(attrs).map(attr => {
      const result = {}
      result[attr] = attrs[attr].raw
      return result
    })
    return data
  }
  return null
}
```

in the CLI you must "activate" the DID you will use to send transactions to the ledger. Whichever DID is activated will be the DID that signs all of the transactions. Like this:
> did use <TRUSTEE DID>

There are nodes running, given you got something.  But nothing useful will come out except through talking to the nodes with a cli.
</p>
<p><strong>sebastillar</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 23:01:46 GMT):<br/>
How can I  do interact with pool? Only with cli?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 23:02:20 GMT):<br/>
The cli (which has libindy in it) or an application with libindy embedded.
</p>
<p><strong>sebastillar</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 23:03:24 GMT):<br/>
so, for set up our dev environment, do you recommend to use a Von Network?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 23:05:37 GMT):<br/>
We built von-network because it makes our lives dead simple :-).

- It spins up both the nodes with one command, 
- has a ledger browser so I can inspect things, 
- allows me to make DIDs, 
- allows me to have a url for the genesis file for the ledger.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 23:06:08 GMT):<br/>
We also have a ledger here that works the same: http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io/
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 23:07:34 GMT):<br/>
We use that with devs by having them:

- use the genesis file for it to connect
- generate a random DID on each startup, so that the DID and related entities (schema, cred def, etc.) are unique.

That saves each dev having to run their own ledger at all.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 23:08:26 GMT):<br/>
It's a 4 node ledger running on Digital Ocean.  Not decentralized, gets updated to new versions from time to time.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 23:09:08 GMT):<br/>
But it has a known Trustee that can write to the ledger so no need to worry about that until you need.
</p>
<p><strong>sebastillar</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 23:10:35 GMT):<br/>
and  how can I to communicate with this Trustee?

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 23:18:08 GMT):<br/>
To start an indy agent, you have to pass in the genesis file that is specific to the network to which you want to connect.

<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 23:18:19 GMT):<br/>
FYI you can use the ledger browser in `von-network` to browse the local indy nodes running from `indy-sdk`
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 23:18:47 GMT):<br/>
If you run von-network, or use BCovrin test, you can just download the genesis file.
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 04 Dec 2019 23:19:04 GMT):<br/>
In `von-network`:
```GENESIS_FILE=<your local dir>/pool_transactions_local_genesis.txt REGISTER_NEW_DIDS=true PORT=9000 python -m server.server
```

What should be the workflow to implement all requests and responses that are not implemented in the cli? That is, what would be the best way forward to implement a system that communicates with the ledger using Aries cloud agents?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 00:19:57 GMT):<br/>
Depends on your use case.  If your app is going to run on other than a mobile device, you can look at ACA-Py - Aries Cloud Agent - Python.

Hyperledger has a new process for managing calendars. Administators of the mailing list group have the right to create calendar appointments. I requested to become an admin so that I could migrate the Contributors calls to the new calendar. Hopefully my efforts are helpful. It would be great if others are admins and can manage this process.

It can be used for general data if if it makes sense for that data to live in the wallet.

1. I posted a new demo video for Indy:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HapWIQdtMOA&list=PLRp0viTDxBWGLdZk0aamtahB9cpJGV7ZF&index=1
Key topics include a discussion of simulation tests we used to fix the instance change process, fixing zeroMQ auto-reconnection between validator nodes, a fix for using two attributes from the same credential, and an update on the most recent releases.

Hi all. Any chance someone can point me to an example DID Document for a DID on Indy?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 11 Dec 2019 21:51:15 GMT):<br/>
No there isn't. Right now, we're using it (as are others that use non-secrets) for connection records, and for protocol state objects only. AFAIK, no one is using it for storing something they want to share via a protocol.

The general architecture is that there is a controller related to an agent instance that handles the business rules that control the agent. Any non-agent-specific data would be stored by the controller - which is likely what you are talking about.

That separation will likely be further emphasized when we got to KMS (keys/ key like objects only, with metadata) and separate "protected storage" for other agent accessed data.

Hello everyone!

I have three major questions left after intensively trying out the How-To's, which I could not find an answer to. Any help on this would be much appreciated!

1. What exactly is a pool? It seems to be different from the network itself.
2. In the "credential" tutorial, what is the encoding for the encoded values in the credential? I could not find any pattern that makes sense to me, so could somebody please give me some information on this?
3. When creating Steward, what is its seed for? And why does it have to have a certain form? I tried different variations, and only the seeds as in the tutorial seem to run (with a little variation).

Thank you!
</p>

<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 21:27:26 GMT):<br/>
@manavgupta Last I heard there were issues related to this making it so that you can only pass 1 restriction.  @ashcherbakov Do you know if this is working now?
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 21:53:51 GMT):<br/>
1. A "pool" is a set of nodes that participate in consensus with each other. The word "network" sometimes refers to the same thing, but in our definition also includes the agents and clients that connect to the pool. 
2. I think the encoding is configurable and we suggest to use SHA256 (which I think is the default...).
3. The seed is a 32 character string used to generate your Steward DID and keys. It is a value that you can save in case your wallet is lost, or in case you want to allow someone else in your organization to act as the Steward. Using the seed, you can create the exact same DID and keys in multiple wallets. I am not sure why the original developers chose 32 characters as the requirement, but it probably has a lot to do with security and consistency for the ledger.

<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 17:17:12 GMT):<br/>
I am assuming that when you say "restrictions" you are referring to the "predicates". For now I think you can send 2 calls. For example: 
Call 1: age > 18 
Call 2: age < 65
Be careful with taking this method to the extreme, though, because you can  end up defeating the purpose by making enough calls to narrow it down  to where you will know the exact age. Here is more information.  It doesn't answer your question or solve your problem but it might be a useful reference. https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0037-present-proof#presentation-preview

We have lots of experience in doing that.  Notably, there is a lot of configuration and code for deploying to an OpenShift (Kubernetes) production environment.  However, a lot of the information depends on the production environment to which you are deploying.  Let us know some more about what you are doing we can likely point you to or help you with the task.

Did you figure this out?
The taaAcceptance date is in the signature of transaction you are trying to author, which also contains a hash to the TAA. There is a ledger transaction to look up the TAA text from the hash.
If you store the taaAcceptance date somewhere for future use, you need to also store the TAA hash with it.

Greetings Indy community!  The new Blockchain Automation Framework lab https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-automation-framework is working to provide production grade automated install of Indy.  We plan to demo our progress on January 9th and we would appreciate any feedback, as well as any opportunities to collaborate and make BAF useful for the Indy community.   https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/labs/viewevent?eventid=654211&calstart=2020-01-09

Sounds interesting.  Is there a definition of what the Indy installer is for?  A single node?  A node on the Sovrin network?  The SDK?  

Thanks

Based on a quick glance it looks like it is deploying a set of Indy nodes.

Not sure if this is the right place to ask this, would appreciate pointers in the right direction if it is not.  Consider a scenario where I have mutliple verifiable credentials that are all based on the same credential schema, possibly all from the same issuer (so cred def for all could be the same).  Perhaps like Microsoft skills certifications or inspections issued by a city government.  And I want to submit all of them or a subset of them in a proof response.  Is that possible?  All of the proof requests that I've seen examples of seem to only allow for the user to respond with one trait value from one qualifying credential for each requested trait in the proof request.  Am I missing something?  Or is this a scenario that is currently unsupported?

Basically, with von-network, we release container images with versions of indy-node code, and have docker compose/bash scripts that make it easy to spin up dev instances that include a ledger browser web UI, and the images and ledger browser can be used when deploying to a cloud platform (e.g. AWS). The core idea is that you are running the entire network - all of the nodes.

Decentralized production deployments are quite a different beast, because you are likely joining an existing network and running just one node of the network.  Sovrin has the only real production instance of an Indy network.

I think that there are still some questions left on my side.
As for:
2. I do not think that this is the encoding as used in the tutorials. It does not have a fixed length and the values are equal for numerical values.

3. Not all seeds work in the tutorial, but only those with specific properties - do you know why this is?
</p>
<p><strong>SigmaS 1</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 11:04:58 GMT):<br/>
Hello @Vincent_S according to this(https://forum.sovrin.org/t/claim-values-encode/620/4) the tutorials have dummy values in encoding. 
About the seed you can find a cleary explanation here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59089178/hypelerdger-indy-node-seed-value

Is there anyway I can get the last "block" number ... Like, when I'm building a GET_TX transaction, when I NEED to send a number, how can I know the most recent tx number? ... Maybe it should have a way to send "latest" and retrieve the last "block" or something like that.

Anyone know of any working Android example code that connects to an Indy pool? I have an Indy pool set up and can connect to it via the Indy-CLI, the Python example, the NodeJS example, but can't connect to it via Android. I've started based on the example at https://github.com/ap050492/Hyperledger-Indy-Wallet---Android . That works for creating a local wallet but I can't connect it to that same Indy pool, even though I'm using the same genesis file. I can't get past "java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: org.hyperledger.indy.sdk.ledger.TimeoutException: Timeout happens for ledger operation."

Hello there,
I am experimenting with Indy and trying to understand how things work. Unfortunately I came across some questions where I need help to move along. 

1) I have found C header files and plenty .rs files, what seems to be Rust. But where can I find the C source code of the libraries implementing all functions of the CLI? 
2) I want to analyse which functions do execute transactions on the ledger and what has been written into it. I have a manually created network (without Docker) and wrapped them together into a pool in the CLI. I have heard that there is a command to just show the 'plain' content of the 3 ledgers?
3) There are three messages which appear in the log of each node on a regular basis and I would like to know what happens there
a) Every 5 minutes there is a "Ledger [0|1|2] is not updated for 301 seconds, so its freshness state is going to be updated now" and right after that an "ordered batch request"
b) I suppose the following message is also connected to the first ones, but I'm note sure: "Node1:0 set last ordered as (0, 7535)"

I look forward for your reply and I have to thank you for your excellent job done so far!

Man, I cannot help you with all the questions but I'll try some:
1) Rust can compile to C "readable" libs. There's no C code, only wrappers to the DLL.
2) indyscan.io. I'm creating an explorer that you can download and read the block directly, but is still WIP. You can use this repo (https://github.com/eduelias/node-indy-request) to see how to send transactions directly to the block. Changing the ledgerId and "data" will return different transactions from different blocks.

Hello Team, may I know where can I find the tutorials about how to use Aries DotNet Framework? From below website, only the initial setup of the environment seems like with latest Aries framework information, but in the sample folder's code is still using AgentFramework's version of code, so may I have anyone's instruction about after setup one local environment, how can I make this agent work with the indy test network?

Hi @lynn.bendixsen In the file verifier.rs the following equality is checked "c_hver == proof.aggregated_proof.c_hash" . Where (which file) can we find the code of how is c_hash created.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 30 Dec 2019 23:12:34 GMT):<br/>
That is expected behaviour.  A user is expected to have a DID per connection, so that his connections are unable to correlate his DIDs.  You should look at the Indy "anoncreds" (Anonymous Credentials) code and docs to learn about the "link secret" that is used by an identity when they are issued credentials, and that they use when proving the claims from the credentials. A verifier can see that the same link secret is used across the claims within a proof.

Basically - DIDs are used for two things.  First, a credential issuer must have a DID on the ledger so that a verifier can determine who issued the credential from which came the claims in a proof. Second, DIDs are used between entities to communicate using a secure channel.  Beyond the issuer's DID there are no other DIDs involved in a verifiable credential exchange.  That's possible through the use of ZKPs in Indy - the "anonymous" part.

We're running dev networks on Digital Ocean using the von-network (https://github.com/bcgov/von-network). Using that makes it pretty easy to spin up a shared network on a VPS.

Hi @swcurran Thanks for the reply. I will try the von network. Do you have maybe an example app with the demonstration of the indy-sdk? Or does it come included with the von github clone? What is the difference between the von github and the official Indy hyperledger education github?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 31 Dec 2019 16:11:00 GMT):<br/>
von-network is based on indy-node.  We have built container images that embedded indy-node, indy-sdk and some utilities (notably, a web ledger browser), and then von-network uses that image in spinning up a network.  You can see an example of one running at Digital Ocean here - http://dev.bcovrin.vonx.io/
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 31 Dec 2019 16:12:35 GMT):<br/>
Not sure which official Indy github you are talking about.  If you specifically mean the hyperledger/education repo, the indy components in that are snapshots of von-network from a long time ago.

Is the von-network the same like Sovrin foundation. Where do deveopers start? I will try to spin the von-network with nodes. Which indy-sdk or app samples are you using to build  a PoC ? Any links would be appreciated. Thanks for your help and I wish you a good start in 2020.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:19:21 GMT):<br/>
von-network is using Indy - same as the Sovrin Foundation. 

For developers to start, we think a great starting spot is with Aries - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/docs/GettingStartedAriesDev/README.md

It covers pretty much everything in indy-sdk (because that is embedded in Aries) and is geared to Devs wanting to build apps on Indy/Aries.

For Sovrin, I know there is a place to get the genesis file and places where you can create your own DID, so you can write to the ledger. Not exactly sure, but you can ask at Sovrin. They have a forum and Rocketchat.

And is it possible to revoke the crendential after the fist use ? (single use verifiable credential)
Is it possible for the verifier to keep track of all verifiable claims that he has verified in order to prevent double use of a credential?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 02 Jan 2020 15:30:51 GMT):<br/>
Good questions:
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 02 Jan 2020 15:30:51 GMT):<br/>
Good questions - some answers:

- Yes, a holder could generate more than one DID per connection. Not normal, but there is no technology way to prevent that.

- Single verification. No automatic way to do that. The issuer must be the one to revoke the credential. Thus, in such a scenario, the verifier would have to contact the issuer to let them know and request the revocation. The verifier must also get a claim that uniquely identifies the holder to tell the issuer.

- Double use. Maybe, but not likely the way you are thinking. The verifier would have to get a claim that uniquely identifies the holder and retain that to check for double use. However, there is some work going on within Ursa that I've heard of that might support an anonymous version of that, which could be used for elections. I don't have details on that, or the timing of when it might be available.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 02 Jan 2020 15:30:51 GMT):<br/>
Multiple DIDs: Yes. Not a typical practice, but nothing to prevent that in the technology.

Single Use: Not an automatic way. A revocation must be done by the issuer, so for that to work, the verifier must notify the issuer to do the revocation. Further, he verifier would have to have received in the proof a claim that uniquely identifies the credential so the issuer would know the credential to revoke. Not easy.

Double Use: Yes, the verifier can track the claims received, and if there is a claim in the proven data, they can prevent double use. I suspect you would like that prevention to be anonymous, and that is not yet supported. It might be possible with some coming enhancements in Ursa and Rich Schema updates, but no timed yet.

Single Use: Not an automatic way. A revocation must be done by the issuer, so for that to work, the verifier must notify the issuer to do the revocation. Further, he verifier would have to have received in the proof a claim that uniquely identifies the credential so the issuer would know the credential to revoke. Not easy.

Double Use: Yes, the verifier can track the claims received, and if there is a claim in the proven data, they can prevent double use. I suspect you would like that prevention to be anonymous, and that is not yet supported. It might be possible with some coming enhancements in Ursa and Rich Schema updates, but no timed yet.

"Yes, the verifier can track the claims received, and if there is a claim in the proven data, they can prevent double use" 
That sounds interesing to me
For my bachelor thesis, I want to build a voting system using DID for authentication purposes. For that I need to make sure that a user ony uses his claim once. I can track the DIDs, who voted. But after voting, the user could make a new connection to the verifier (=> new DID) and use the same credential again.

How should the verifyer track the claim ? 
Must the claim be uniquely identifiable ?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 02 Jan 2020 16:22:40 GMT):<br/>
With current technology, yes, which means it is not anonymous, which is not good for a voting system. That likely means that some "trusted third party" is needed somewhere.

As I mentioned, there is a plan to implement that in the future, but no timeline.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 02 Jan 2020 16:24:03 GMT):<br/>
"that" - meaning a way to use a ZKP to detect the use of a credential so that double voting is detected and handled - e.g. only the last vote counts.

Tnx. I see that indy agents are in kind of a ? state.
Due to Aries project. So until Aries is ready I thought maybe just use SDK directly
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 02 Jan 2020 23:08:35 GMT):<br/>
Aries agents are more mature versions of indy agents. 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 02 Jan 2020 23:10:37 GMT):<br/>
Wherever you would use Indy Agents, use Aries instead.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 02 Jan 2020 23:11:23 GMT):<br/>
Using the indy-sdk directly is pretty difficult and that work is encapsulated in Aries agents.
</p>
<p><strong>biligunb</strong> (Fri, 03 Jan 2020 05:29:09 GMT):<br/>
But aries agent is kinda in DEVELOPMENT stage right?

@swcurran Hi. I wanted to test and run the complete VON network on a VPS.

hi all, I have one question that, if some of target users are not using mobile phone in their daily work, but we still need these individuals be participants for the Indy network, what is the best way for them to securely manage their wallets, public/private keys, DIDs, and VCs, etc? Kindly advise. Thanks.

<p><strong>jljordan_bcgov</strong> (Sat, 04 Jan 2020 22:04:32 GMT):<br/>
From an open source point of view Aries Cloud Agent - Python and Aries Framework DotNet are the most mature agents available. Work is progressing on Aries Framework Go as well. The first two agents mentioned (Python and DotNet) support Indy / ZKP based verifiable credential exchange protocols.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 06 Jan 2020 15:56:13 GMT):<br/>
Yes.  The holder constructs a "Proof of non-revocation" when they construct a proof, and can do so at any time. They can monitor what entries are put into the Rev. Reg and tell if their credential has been revoked.  BTW - the verifier cannot do that - only the holder can tell that.  Same is true when a proof is created.

Hello guys! Does Indy support verification of a credential validity that was used in the past? I mean, assuming there is an event requiring a user to prove that the credential he is using is not revoked, and that such proof must then be used by another party to collect money from the credential issuer, for instance. If a week passes between the generation of the proof and the money collection by the party offering the service, is he able to proof that, at the time of the transaction, the credential was valid? How would that work, under the woods? Thanks a lot! :)

Hello everyone! We encountered an issue regarding credential verification while implementing a process where the workflow is as follows:

1. An issuer creates _Credential 1_ and adds it to the accumulator.
2. A proof verification using _Credential 1_ is conducted.
3. The same issuer creates another credential _Credential 2_ under the same claim definition, adding it to the same accumulator.
4. A proof verification using _Credential 1_  is conducted.
5. A proof verification using _Credential 2_  is conducted. 

We observe that all proofs related to _Credential 1_ are accepted, while those for _Credential 2_ aren't.

Even if we issue and revoke several credentials in step 3, a proof verification in step 4 is still succesful. In our opinion, this indicates that we use the correct witness deltas in the proof of non-revocation. Everything for _Credential 1_ (the first credential in the accumulator) works as it should, while it does not for _Credential 2_.

Does anybody have an idea why this occurs? Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks!

I believe that has been changed recently (last 6 months). Suggest looking through recently completed JIRAs.

Hey Guys
Is it possible to decrypt the Data I exported from the Wallet with the export Key?

Exp:
`await Wallet.export_wallet(wh, {
        'path': EXPORT_PATH,
        'key': '123',
        'key_derivation_method': 'ARGON2I_MOD'  # Could also be "ARGON2I_INT" or "RAW"
    })`
If i call this function I get a file in my Export_Path where the key '123' is used for encription, right?
</p>

Hello Indy Folks-  Ramping up on indy and have a question.  I've been through all walk-through code and all the how to code running against a local docker network and a network of nodes created on GCE using the instructions from https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/start-nodes.md.

My question is that I want to automate the creation of GCE nodes using terraform and don't want to use `generate_indy_pool_transactions` since that seems specific for create a test network with a well known seed.  Is there any code or documentation for creating the genesis txns and files needed to create the nodes and link them together? 
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Thu, 09 Jan 2020 19:37:21 GMT):<br/>
Is there any writing or video that explains the security model of the wallet.  Especially:  where are they cryptographic keys stored
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Thu, 09 Jan 2020 19:42:38 GMT):<br/>
What is the justification for their security in relation to storage?   In the demos when you create a new wallet, the returned value  is assigned to a variable, isn't this is a security fall (especially for js applications).  Finally for applications that want to use secure storage enclaves like android keystore, are they any example implementations that can be referenced?
</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Thu, 09 Jan 2020 19:47:20 GMT):<br/>
Ok, left to my own devices I think I've cobbled together the answer.  Based on the start-nodes doc I have to create the pool txn genesis file and the domain txn genesis file with the first Trustee (domain) and then and additional Stewards (for the nodes?) and then the Node txns for each node.  I see most of the code I need in or referenced by test_network_setup.py in indy-plenum (minus the stuff that is specific to the test set up).  I'm going to put this together into a script and try to add it to my terraform automation.  I feel like I might need to submit each node txn separately after I create the first node...  tbd.

A question for @kenebert and @brentzundel.  We've had a couple of reasonable requests about when a proof is "verified" with respect to the proof request used. These are not part of the current process, and I wonder if they were planned to be supported in the Rich Schema work?

1) Recently add to Indy is the idea of a group of claims that have common restrictions. Will it be possible with Rich Schema to express in the Rich Schema work that the credentials in the group MUST come from the same credential?  I believe that currently, all claims are handled independently in the proof/verification process. So far example, I can say "must use a Driver's License Schema" and such that the claims can be from any jurisdiction that issued Driver's License schema credentials, but claims returned must be from the same credential.

2) We have found that in Indy, it appears that all claims are optional. That is, I can have a proof request asking for some claims, get back a proof with some of the claims provided and the proof will be "verified" (which is cryptographically correct). Will there be in Rich Schema to indicate required/optional claims such that the proof would only be verified if all the required claims were provided. Note that the existing behaviour is also very useful, so we don't want to lose it.

If that is not planned, at what level would you expect such logic to be added?  If not in Indy, I'm assuming the app would have to do that business checking and presumably send a Problem Report message back to the Prover and redo the process.  It would be much better if the prover knew those requirements ahead of time and only constructed a proof meeting those guidelines.

Hi all, I have a question that in indy document walkthrough in connection establishment section of onboarding part its written that the steward sends the NYM transaction for did created for feber. Is that mean the Pseudonym-did is stored on the ledger ? Because in the "White Paper: Sovrin: What Goes On The Ledger" mentioned that private-dids are not stored on the ledger.

If you are using one the Java examples in the How-Tos and followed JeromeK's advice of commenting out the Pool.createPoolLedgerConfig line to get past your previous error,  note that, you'd eventually need to re-enable that line. When the How-To samples run to completion, they execute a Pool.deletePoolLedgerConfig command.

We can do this with Pedersen commitments and equality proofs which very lightweight. The disadvantage of hashing is you get link ability which in most voting systems is not allowed. The link ability comes from the presentation. Do you want to know if someone has voted already but not who they are necessarily

@MALodder 
I can prove that a certain DID has voted but  a user can create multiple connections (=> multiple DIDs) to the verifier, I can't make sure that someone votes twice ...

I really want this to work, but it seems that I am too early with this technology.

@VithushanJegatheeswaran you can make it DID agnostic.

You can bind the vote to an identity value and require them to present certain information to prevent duplication

<p><strong>VithushanJegatheeswaran</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 15:36:04 GMT):<br/>
I already thought about adding a random number for each credential but then the issuer and verifier can communicate and track down the voter 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 15:38:03 GMT):<br/>
Each credential in indy is bound to a link secret. You can bind the vote to the link secret without revealing the link secret using a pedersen commitment. When someone casts a vote, you require they present a commitment to their link secret with their vote.  A proof of other attributes from a credential signed by an issuer should be used as well to prove they are allowed to vote like age, registration, and other meaningful values if needed. The point is, if they try to vote again, then the duplication will be detected. The other option, is to issue then a one time spendable credential. The credential can still be issued to the link secret which is only known to the holder. When the holder votes, the credential is spent and cannot be used again.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 15:38:39 GMT):<br/>
What is the purpose of the random number?
</p>
<p><strong>VithushanJegatheeswaran</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 15:46:21 GMT):<br/>
i wanted to add a random number to each claim. 
So the holder can send it to the verifier, which logs that number. 

if the same random number appears on a vote, the verifier can be sure that the person already voted. 


BUT on the other hand the verifier can also ask the issuer to which person the number belongs ... which breaks the anonymity 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 15:48:03 GMT):<br/>
Right, I'm saying its not needed because the link secret can be used in its place. Instead you ask the holder to present a commitment to their link secret and add the commitment to the voted set. If the set detects a duplicate, then the person has already voted. If not, then add the commitment to the set
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 15:50:25 GMT):<br/>
The commitment serves three purposes, one it hides the actual link secret from the verifier and protects the holder's identity, two, it is created at random so even if the holder tries to vote multiple times, the presentations are unlinkable, three, it is used to detect if the same value has already been used, double spend proofing
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 15:50:39 GMT):<br/>
All of this can be done in zero-knowledge

Not sure if this came clear, but this is my understanding of how this would work in a practical sense.

Each voter would have a credential that entitled them to vote. That could be a a gov't ID, an organization membership credential. If the election was for a city, it could be a national ID and the person would prove that there address had that city (but nothing else).

The election organizer (e.g. the election commission) would send out a proof request that included the claims to be proven to show eligibility to vote, and a unique ID for the election. Voters would prove the claim, their election choices and use the unique election ID with their Indy link secret to handle the commitment.

The election organizer would receive the proofs and be able to detect duplicates, applying some policy on handling duplicate votes (most likely - last one counts).

Note that the commitment functionality as described here is NOT currently implemented in Indy.  It is possible and will very likely get done, but is not in place today.  It's one of the key features that needs to be added to the technology.

Note that in such a system, voting multiple times is not a bad thing, as long as an eligible voter only gets one vote counted, and there is a clear policy on how multiple votes are handled.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 19:09:26 GMT):<br/>
BTW - the hash idea doesn't work because either the issuer provides it and then it's just a unique ID that can be correlated with the voter, or the voter self-issues it, in which case they can just make up a different value each time (since no one can check the hash).
</p>
<p><strong>VithushanJegatheeswaran</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 19:22:07 GMT):<br/>
Yes you're right. The hash idea was stupid :D 

"Note that in such a system, voting multiple times is not a bad thing..." 
I had no problem with voting multiple times but with voting with multiple DIDs. 
As you already said, I'll count the vote only 



"Note that the commitment functionality as described here is NOT currently implemented in Indy." 

I will (somehow) try to implement this into my app

Hi, guys, I have some questions about the Hyperledger Indy focusing on the credential revocation. Thank you for your help.

The credential revocation of Indy refers to https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/hipe/en/latest/text/0109-anoncreds-protocol/README.html
The CKS accumulator refers to this paper https://eprint.iacr.org/2008/539.pdf

Questions

1. In the Non-revocation Credential Cryptographic Setup phase, a type-III pairing is chosen. Is there any suggestion while choosing all three groups G1, G2 and GT? For example, how many bits is the order r suggested to be? By the way, is there some special purpose to use a type-III pairing? The referred CKS accumulator uses a type-I pairing which G1 = G2. The CKS accumulator could be referred here.

2. The architecture includes an accumulator system that the issuer side stores the states (V and {g'_i} for all i in [1, 2L]) and the blockchain stores the indices V and accumulator acc.

By the definition of accumulator on wiki:
A cryptographic accumulator is a one way membership function. It answers a query as to whether a potential candidate is a member of a set without revealing the individual members of the set. 

We have the following questions:

It seems not a one-way function if everyone can observe V and acc together from the blockchain. The mapping of indices i and parameters g'_i could be gradually found after several accumulator updates.

Following the above question, after the mapping relationship is totally observed, I believe the membership of the current accumulator is entirely revealed.

If V is stored on the ledger, the size of V keeps growing alone with more holders get involved in. In my opinion, the size of a cryptographic accumulator should be independent from the number of members.

In short, we estimate that the indices V may not be suitable to be published and stored on the ledger. Please feel free to indicate if we misunderstood something. 

Thank you very much.

Just a small question regarding Indy, Is it possible to track how many verifications a verifier has done? 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 17 Jan 2020 14:52:40 GMT):<br/>
The verifier could do that, but no other party.  There has in the past been discussions of the notion of "Premium Credentials" that would enable some sort of mechanism for enable payment to another party (most likely the issuer, but could be the prover) prior to verification, but I don't recall seeing details of how that would work. A key to the approach would be to ensure that the issuer knew an issued credential was verified, but not which credential, so the issuer could not monitor prover activity.

The credential is stored in the wallet of the prover. you (I guess you're the issuer) can only revoke the credential. If the Prover deletes the credential, there is no way to get it back(correct me if I'm wrong).

I'm working with Hyperledger Indy-SDK Library. I want to connect indy-sdk with web server through REST Api and perform operations, how to do so?

Forexample, Here is a tutorial of How To Write a DID and Query Its Verkey. So, for this, one has to run indy_pool in docker and paste this code in Python IDE and run it inorder to perform the task. Now, I want to write a Did or Issue a Did or perform any task by sending a request through API.

Is this Possible and yes, then how?

@MALodder "...the link secret can be used in its place. Instead you ask the holder to present a commitment to their link secret..." 

How can I be sure that the holder uses his link secret and not some other random value ? 


Will the holder reveal his link secret after the end of the voting ?
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Tue, 28 Jan 2020 16:20:15 GMT):<br/>
You just have to design an API on top, have a look at the aries-cloud-agent

to get some inspiration
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 28 Jan 2020 16:23:57 GMT):<br/>
Because the link secret was signed by the issuer and if it’s changed the proof is invalid

Hi guys, I am playing with libvcx and want to rotate an issuers verkey, which AFAIK, is best done using libindy using `replaceKeys*` methods, which require wallet handle. I initialized a wallet using its config through `provisionAgent` in vcx nodejs wrapper (which calls `vcx_agent_provision_async`), which does not return the wallet handle. Is there a way to the obtain wallet handle using its config and key?

The error is a permission denied, so it's likely the path doesn't exist somewhere - the parent directory perhaps.  I'm not familiar with the tutorial, so if you could point me to it that would be appreciated. Regardless, Ian probably knows the answer :-)

<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 31 Jan 2020 17:16:05 GMT):<br/>
Yes I think it's an issue with permissions on the local `./tmp` directory
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 31 Jan 2020 17:16:39 GMT):<br/>
indy CLI is running in the docker container and it's writing to a mounted local `./tmp` directory
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 31 Jan 2020 17:30:28 GMT):<br/>
A quick workaround is to precreate the necessary folders, give them world rw permissions, including the "s" parameter in chmod so that items created within the folder inherit the permissions of the parent folder.

The real answer is in docker handling that is pretty tricky. The docker daemon is creating the volume on startup and so it is created with root privileges (since the docker daemon runs as root), and so when the non-root use running in the container tries to write to the folder, it is not allowed.

Hi @PaulA , in the `von-agent-template` repository, when you run the configuration script `. init.sh` it should update the configuration files in a consistent state.  If you have done any manual edits, the configuration files (`config/*.yml`) may be in an inconsistent state and that could be the cause of the error.  I suggest re-setting your environment (stop all docker containers and run `./manage rm` in each of the 3 shells), `git stash` any changes you've made in `von-agent-template`, and then re-run the `. init.sh` configuration script (and rebuild your docker containers).
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Sun, 02 Feb 2020 18:23:09 GMT):<br/>
A second recommendation - `OrgBook` is the "old" version of the code, the new version - which has been migrated to the new Aries agent - is in `https://github.com/bcgov/indy-catalyst`
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Sun, 02 Feb 2020 18:24:07 GMT):<br/>
.. and there is a corresponding sample agent which is in `https://github.com/bcgov/indy-catalyst-issuer-controller`

Hi, I am facing an error "org.hyperledger.indy.sdk.InvalidStateException: The SDK library experienced an unexpected internal error." When trying to call openPoolLedger. I am running a react native App on an android device. I have written a Module in Java where I have used the indy java sdk v1.14.1. The loading of the sodium and zmq libraries happen succesfully in 'onCreate'. 'createPoolLedgerConfig' is also working. I am using a node pool on a remote host using docker.

Hi everyone! I've a question about how the verkey in a get_nym transaction response differs from the public keys mentioned in the DID Doc. Does the verkey refer to one of the keys in the did doc or is it something totally different?
</p>
<p><strong>gnarula</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 09:46:03 GMT):<br/>
also, for a message received from Alice, I reckon Bob should verify the signature using the verkey (as indy_key_for_did suggests). In that case, shouldn't the verkey also exist in the publicKey block of a DID Doc? What happens if it's revoked/rotated? Would get_nym transaction return the new key?
</p>
<p><strong>gnarula</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 09:55:20 GMT):<br/>
ah, verkey is base58(last 16 bytes) of one of the keys in publicKeys block and did is base58(first 16 bytes). nvm

Regarding my question above (https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=CQXXvzJ67h95zn7rY), would it make sense to expose `vcx_get_handle` (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/vcx/libvcx/src/utils/libindy/wallet.rs#L18) as part of VCX API so that applications (like ours), which want to use libindy functions which need to access the wallet used by VCX?

<p><strong>gnarula</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 15:54:38 GMT):<br/>
what's the format for the `endpoint` attribute in sovrin? ACA-Py sort of assumes `endpoint: { 'endpoint': 'url' }` where the Service block in the DIDDoc gets a service of type "IndyAgent" and the given url. How would that work for multiple endpoints?
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 16:10:46 GMT):<br/>
It's missing a signature, are you sure you followed all the steps?
</p>
<p><strong>PaulA</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 16:13:02 GMT):<br/>
Hi @ianco I'm following the steps from this link: https://github.com/bcgov/von-network/blob/master/docs/Writing%20Transactions%20to%20a%20Ledger%20for%20an%20Un-privileged%20Author.md   I hope it's up to date. I'm using same did as author and endorser. 
</p>
<p><strong>PaulA</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 17:56:15 GMT):<br/>
@ianco on an open wallet, do i need to use the exact endorser's did registered on staging net to write or read from the staging net? also, must endorsement be done using the same did ?
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 17:57:03 GMT):<br/>
The endorsement needs to be done by a DID with write permissions to staging net
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 17:57:36 GMT):<br/>
In this example (https://github.com/bcgov/von-network/blob/master/docs/Writing%20Transactions%20to%20a%20Ledger%20for%20an%20Un-privileged%20Author.md) there are two wallets and two did's involved
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 17:57:52 GMT):<br/>
One is the transaction author, and one is the endorser
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 17:58:24 GMT):<br/>
I think the transaction author can write the transaction once it's endorsed (?) ...  I don't recall all the details offhand
</p>
<p><strong>PaulA</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 18:02:16 GMT):<br/>
@ianco  I have a did and verkey with endorsement rights on the staging net although i've lost the keys for the original wallet i used in creating that did. Would I still be able to use the did with a new wallet provided i am still in possession of the seeds?
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 18:02:43 GMT):<br/>
Yes you can recreate the DID from the seed
</p>
<p><strong>PaulA</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 18:02:57 GMT):<br/>
when i recreate, the Verkey changes. 
</p>
<p><strong>PaulA</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 18:03:36 GMT):<br/>
it's not the same as the original, and i'm thinking that could be affecting something (?)
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 18:03:38 GMT):<br/>
Is it a different format of verkey?  (i.e. with or without a leading `~`?)
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 18:04:06 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure what is the impact of having a different verkey
</p>
<p><strong>PaulA</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 18:05:18 GMT):<br/>
yes, the verkey starts with ~
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 18:06:22 GMT):<br/>
AFAIK when you generate a DID from a seed the verkey should be the same, HOWEVER there are two formats of verkey, and that's about the limit of my knowledge
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 18:06:37 GMT):<br/>
Try creating a DID using the CLI and see what the verkey looks like
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 18:06:43 GMT):<br/>
(indy CLI)
</p>
<p><strong>PaulA</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 18:08:17 GMT):<br/>
I've created many did and they all start with ~
</p>
<p><strong>PaulA</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 18:11:40 GMT):<br/>
?
</p>
<p><strong>PaulA</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 18:13:35 GMT):<br/>
Do i keep using this indy-cli or aca-py cli?
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 18:14:42 GMT):<br/>
It should work either way, I don't know offhand if there is any difference
</p>
<p><strong>PaulA</strong> (Tue, 04 Feb 2020 18:18:18 GMT):<br/>
Ok thanks. Will keep trying.

Hi guys, I am developing an application based on indy. I have already written an agent using aries, but up until now was using test indy pools for the same. Need help running a production pool of indy. Was following the docs but need some clarity.
1 - Is generate_indy_pool_transactions the only way to generate domain and pool txn. Cause it feels this script was created to be only used in test environments
2 - If not generate_indy_pool_transactions then how to generate the same after initializing nodes using init_indy_node
3 - What is the purpose of seed in init_indy_node?
4 - I was able to run the network using generate_indy_pool_transactions, but how can i get the possesion of trustee did, so I can configure the network more
5 - My current implementation of production network is as follows. Let me know if this is the best way to go about it
       - I spin up a gcp node. But I am using a docker container to run the indy-node with proper volume mounting.
 If you guys can point me to some guide on how to run, manage your own production indy network that will be very helpful. 
Thank you in advance        
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Wed, 05 Feb 2020 19:44:40 GMT):<br/>
Hi Ayushman, I think what you are looking for is https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/steward-tools/tree/master/create_genesis
That answers questions 1, 2, and 4 for you, but I can clarify more if needed. (All Trustee DIDs are created by you and put into the file as part of the script)   
3- the seed returned by init-indy-node is the seed used to generate the keys for that node.  If your node needs re-installed, add the seed as the last parameter to the same init-indy-node command that you ran the first time, and it will generate the same seeds as when you ran it the first time.
5- Your implementation should work, but be careful to make sure you use sufficient Memory (32G/node is recommended and tests have shown issues when using 8G or less) and make sure you don't run out of disk space.  I have seen cases where out-of-disc-space problems give unrelated error messages that are hard to track down.  The Sovrin production Nodes that I coordinate are each on a different server and I know of other successful production networks that do the same, so that is what I would recommend : 1 node per server and avoid using Docker if possible (it adds unnecessary overhead?).

Team question on when an identity receives a connection request e.g How does an identity Jim know that the connection request is sent by an employer like Google... I am assuming the pairwise did and verkey sent by Google is published in the ledger so that Jim can verify that in the ledger and not Google's trust anchor did and verkey
</p>
<p><strong>SigmaS 1</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 14:54:44 GMT):<br/>
isn't a bad choice to sore the pairwise did (even from the Issuer side) in the ledger? I think Jim verifies Google from its public did through the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>SigmaS 1</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 14:54:44 GMT):<br/>
isn't a bad choice to store the pairwise did (even from the Issuer side) in the ledger? I think Jim verifies Google from its public did through the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>anillewis</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 14:55:56 GMT):<br/>
if Jim verifies Google from the public DID, what prevents Oracle to send Google's public DID and the send their DID and verkey in the pairwise object?
</p>
<p><strong>anillewis</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 14:56:40 GMT):<br/>
now Jim will be exchanging messages with Oracle thinking it is exchanging messages with Google
</p>
<p><strong>SigmaS 1</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 15:00:29 GMT):<br/>
I am new to Indy, however I believe that Jim will send he's pairwise to Google's did endpoint and he will cryptoAnonCrypt first with Google's pairwise and second with Google's public. So even Oracle has Google dids, it can go any further and establish a relationship with Jim
</p>
<p><strong>anillewis</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 15:02:05 GMT):<br/>
this is good when the connection request is issued from Jim to Google but what about the other way ?
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 15:22:43 GMT):<br/>
@anillewis  if Oracle passes Google's public did, the did auth protocol will fail...afaik
</p>
<p><strong>anillewis</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 15:23:23 GMT):<br/>
how?
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 15:26:20 GMT):<br/>
Did auth if I am not wrong is kind of a challenge response thing, where Jim will encrypt a small text with public key found in the public did and will expect to decrypt with its pvt key. Which Oracle will fail
</p>
<p><strong>anillewis</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 15:29:39 GMT):<br/>
see https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/issues/144#issuecomment-567216211  .. i think i got my answer and has nothing to do with did auth protocol...see the solution recommended by talltree

Also what is the best way to generate Dids using seeds?
One way to go is using the sdk, create a wallet and create and store the did in the wallet. But it seems like an overkill for such a simple task. Or will it be better if I use plenum's DidSigner class to generate did?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 07 Feb 2020 17:40:27 GMT):<br/>
Should there be an option to create a Credential Definition with a seed?  We do that for DIDs, but not for Cred Defs.   It does make some things easier to manage.
</p>
<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Fri, 07 Feb 2020 21:01:55 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 07 Feb 2020 21:06:44 GMT):<br/>
It starts from a random seed vs. a parameter. As such, pretty sure it would work.

Would be useful for testing

For anoncreds 1.0 this wouldn't work
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Sat, 08 Feb 2020 16:36:03 GMT):<br/>
for anoncreds 2.0 this would work
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Sat, 08 Feb 2020 16:36:11 GMT):<br/>
the hard part is generating safe primes
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Sat, 08 Feb 2020 16:36:20 GMT):<br/>
which is what anoncreds 1.0 depends
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Sat, 08 Feb 2020 16:44:08 GMT):<br/>
anoncreds 2.0 should make this easier
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Sat, 08 Feb 2020 16:44:33 GMT):<br/>
because all the parameters are based on the curve so all you have to do is seed the CSPRNG to generate the keys

can we store indy wallet credentials in other formats rather than storing it as sqlite.db & sqlite.db-wal. can i store it in .pem or .cert format ?
@JeromeK @esplinr @swcurran @VithushanJegatheeswaran 
</p>
<p><strong>aravindavk</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 11:36:09 GMT):<br/>
Yes, possible by creating custom storage methods https://docs.rs/indy-sys/1.14.2/indy_sys/wallet/fn.indy_register_wallet_storage.html
</p>
<p><strong>aravindavk</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 11:38:40 GMT):<br/>
example in aca-py https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/aries_cloudagent/storage/provider.py#L15-L19
</p>
<p><strong>thanga_troondx</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 11:51:32 GMT):<br/>
but in .cert or .pem formats ?
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 12:18:29 GMT):<br/>
I think you can simply create a Schema with exp:
`cert` and `pem` attributes
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 12:19:14 GMT):<br/>
and then fill in the values as needed
</p>
<p><strong>thanga_troondx</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 12:41:22 GMT):<br/>
@aravindavk  can you explain a bit please ?
</p>
<p><strong>sukalpomitra</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 13:24:22 GMT):<br/>
I agree with Jerome. Best way is to screate schema with cert and pem attri butes
</p>
<p><strong>aravindavk</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 16:21:51 GMT):<br/>
@thanga_troondx as per my understanding add_record(or similar) function can save as cert and pem instead of storing the values in db
</p>
<p><strong>JeromeK</strong> (Tue, 11 Feb 2020 16:58:08 GMT):<br/>
add_record also stores the values into the wallet as non_secrets

</p>
<p><strong>dgunseli</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 15:41:47 GMT):<br/>
I guess I have to explain a little bit more
</p>
<p><strong>dgunseli</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 15:48:23 GMT):<br/>
Let’s consider this, users can create proofs with proof request and proof requester can verify the proof with the specific request that they provided
</p>
<p><strong>dgunseli</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 15:49:43 GMT):<br/>
But is there any way to accomplish this scenario, user want to create a proof and stream this proof
</p>

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 16:12:41 GMT):<br/>
haven't solved it yet
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 16:12:49 GMT):<br/>
I think if I understand the question, the answer is yes. The prover can create their own proof request and proof if they want. The nonce is to prevent replays of a proof, so if the prover is producing the request and proof, that protection is lost. 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 16:13:55 GMT):<br/>
Even then, if a verifier would to just give the nonce and assume the prover knows the rest of the proof request, I think even that could be accomplished. 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 16:14:08 GMT):<br/>
Let me know if I have misunderstood the question.

<p><strong>VithushanJegatheeswaran</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 16:15:13 GMT):<br/>
Hey there is a java wrapper for indy-sdk.
check out the how-tos:
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/docs/how-tos
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 16:17:09 GMT):<br/>
The number of nodes depends on the number of faulty nodes you want to permit. To support f faults in the system, you need 3f+1 total nodes. So if you are OK with only 2 nodes failing at any one time, you need f=2 or 7 total nodes.  The practical limit has found to be f=8 or 25 total nodes. That balances a robust network with the speed of consensus.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 16:18:31 GMT):<br/>
How that relates to the number of users on the platform is a different question. It depends on (a) how many issuers, and (b) how much revocation is happening.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 16:19:42 GMT):<br/>
If there is only one issuer and no revocation, there would only be 3 extra transactions beyond the genesis transactions.  Not many...

How do you have a network with no nodes?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 12 Feb 2020 19:49:45 GMT):<br/>
When you create the network, you establish a couple of trustee DIDs. They can make stewards.

Hello,
One of indy's dependencies is ZeroMQ, does this library is only used for connection with the ledger in client-server scenario or is it also used for connection between 2 clients ? i-e Is it only used to connect an actor (holder, verifier or issuer) with a node or is it also used for connection between 2 actors ?

<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 13:40:51 GMT):<br/>
ZeroMQ is used to client-to-node (client-server) and node-to-node (server-to-server).
ZeroMQ is not used for connections between 2 actors. In principle, any transport can be used for such connections.

Hi Guys, Having a very basic doubt.... Should we need to create `schema-def` for every issue? or single `schema-def` and use the `handler` to issue multiple time?  The reason for this question is, getting the following error `Invalid Credential Definition handle` when try to issue. This def has been created 3 days back
</p>
<p><strong>lauravuo-techlab</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 14:23:45 GMT):<br/>
Issuer defines credential definition (for a single schema). Then the issuer can issue multiple different credentials for this single credential definition. Note that you have to issue the credentials with the same wallet you have created the credential definition with.

Hi Hyperledger community!!
I have some questions! I'm researching indy-crypto and ursa now.
I heard that the zero-knowledge proof (in indy and ursa) verify the committed value (attributes) over the point (do not verify under value) using range proof. Is it true?
Is these cryptosystem based on integer? (How can verify non-integer value? - trasnform?)
How can I find relative documents?
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Tue, 18 Feb 2020 11:30:41 GMT):<br/>
The range proof works over elements of finite field, so others like fractional or negative values have to be transformed appropriately. eg if we are working in a 256 bit finite field and we want to do range proofs over 32 bit negative values like prove [2^{-32} < x < 2^{32}, there would be 2 range proofs, 0 <= x < 2^{32} and 2^{224} < x < 2^256 (-ve values wrap around and map to the larger field elements). We don't have such examples in Ursa as of now. We use Bulletproofs and here is the range proof code https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/blob/master/libzmix/bulletproofs_amcl/src/r1cs/gadgets/bound_check.rs

We use Bulletproofs and here is the range proof code https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/blob/master/libzmix/bulletproofs_amcl/src/r1cs/gadgets/bound_check.rs

how can I use libindy apis using c only? Do I have to make wrapper for it(I think its' not required!)? if you have some example please share

pardon reviving an old thread :) 

Here is a demo of Hyperledger Labs Blockchain Automation Framework deploying an Indy network, which we understand to be different from von-network deploying an application to an existing Indy network.

I am writing a program in C, using libindy include files (.h header files and libindy.so). I stuck at command_handle parameter asked in indy_create_pool_ledger_config(indy_handle_t command_handle, const char *  config_name, const char *  config,void (*cb)(indy_handle_t command_handle_, indy_error_t err);
What should I pass?
Is there any example out there?

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 19 Feb 2020 14:05:05 GMT):<br/>
Yes, there are menu examples. Check the indy-sdk repo for unit tests and code documentation. The parameter `config_name` is looking for a name of configuration (of your choice)

`iiw-book-agent_1     | aries_cloudagent.ledger.error.LedgerError: Credential definition 4QxzWk3ajdnEA37NdNU5Kt:3:CL:1068:default is on ledger default but not in wallet default`

That likely means that you ran the test previously, deleted your wallet but not your ledger (I'm guessing you are running von-network?). Reset everything and it should work again.  Unlike DIDs, you can't use a seed to create a Cred Def, so once created, they can't be recreated, so you must keep your wallet and ledger in sync,

Thank you for reply, I'll check that, but I am still confused what should I put in command_handle (int32_t)?

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 13:31:57 GMT):<br/>
Incremental int32. The library will pass that handle back as a reference, in the callback method.

Hey, I'm using the BCovrin Test network (http://138.197.138.255/)
What do you mean by "reset everything" should I delete all my docker containers and images ?
I cloned both repos (email-verification-service and iiw-book) and followed the readme file.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 18:03:42 GMT):<br/>
Probably should take this to #aries-cloudagent-python as the devs there can help better.

My guess is that it is starting with an explicit seed for the DID, and that DID is then creating the other objects. I would guess if you start with a different seed, all would work, but that's a guess.

I have multiple questions at concept level:

1. I have check out the APIs I didn't find any API to add more public keys in DID doc. Is it possible? it should be according to the standards! 

2. Is there any way by which I can revoke the DID itself?

3. In a situation, A device creating DID for itself (off ledger) and this device can’t do the NYM‌ request/transaction itself, It required some third service to do the transaction on behalf. So, what should I do? Do I require Agents or Endorsers to do the work?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 23 Feb 2020 20:24:14 GMT):<br/>
1. It depends what the DID method you are talking about.  Indy does not yet support that.  With did:peer you could send to the other side anything, but the other agent is unlikely to know what to do.

2. Not really, but arguable. If the DID is on a public ledger (immutable), what does "revoke" mean?  You could null out the public key(s)/endpoint in the DIDDoc as an indicator to say "abandoned!". The previous public keys are still there.  As well, you can just stop responding to interactions with that DID.  It's still there, but you unilaterally ignore it. You could even delete your private key for it.

3. If you are creating a public DID, you create it yourself, and then you send it to be published on a ledger.  That would be the "third party" you are talking about. If it is a private, pairwise DID (did:peer), you send it to the other party that you want to use the DID.

I don't know for sure, but I'm guessing because you are in a sandbox for dev, and there is no protectio from that visibility. It might be that they are using the same volume for the storage in docker and so have visibility to each others data., but I'm not sure.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 24 Feb 2020 22:32:18 GMT):<br/>
You can have the DID created using a seed you save using an agent/process that can pay for it to be published on the ledger. Later when you use the device that *can't* pay for something, it will use the same *seed* to create the DID in its own wallet, and verify that it is on the ledger.  That device doesn't have to pay for the write operation.

Does that help?

Hi, nothing can stop you from creating and using private Indy network, if you wish to do so. Of course, if all nodes will belong just to one organization it loses decentralization advantage, because entity controlling more than 2/3 of all nodes can rewrite ledger at its whim, but for internal corporate use cases it might be okay. Btw, is there any particular reason why you don't want to use Sovrin public network?

Yes, in order to get some fault tolerance you need at least 4 validator nodes (in this case pool can survive 1 offline or otherwise misbehaving node), and this is a recommended minimal configuration. As far as I remember it is possible to run smaller pools, but in this case any node going down will render pool nonfunctional, and such configuration were not tested, so there might be other problems if you try to run less than 4 nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>sergey.khoroshavin</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 13:05:07 GMT):<br/>
As for observer nodes - as of now this feature is only partly implemented, so in effect all nodes are either validators or not participating at all
</p>
<p><strong>sergey.khoroshavin</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 13:05:55 GMT):<br/>
So, quick recap - minimal safe configuration is pool of 4 validator nodes
</p>

I see your point, thanks!

HI there, I am new to Hyperledger Indy and I am trying to develop the demo provided by hyperledger indy about college certificates all from scratch by myself but I don't know where to start or what I will need so I need some help. I already read the Indy documentation and understood the details.
Would I be working with hyperldger Aries frameworks or would I need to use the indy-sdk and von network? ANy help would be much appreciated.

We've created a course on edX aimed at developers asking that question.  It launches next week.  In the meantime, a quick and dirty mini version of the course is here that you could start with. https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/docs/GettingStartedAriesDev/README.md

We definitely recommend starting and building on Aries, which embeds Indy implementations vs. trying to start at the pure Indy level.

Question from a Slack user for @andrew.whitehead or @ianco 

I'd like to establish a DIDComm connection using aries-cloudagent-python.

I got it working with creating/receiving invitations using the REST API. Now I'd like to establish a connection using DIDComm only with public DIDs (implicit invitation).

Receiving such a connection request for an implicit invitation seems to be supported by aries-cloudagent-python (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/issues/358#issuecomment-581503697 and https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/aries_cloudagent/protocols/connections/manager.py#L380). But I couldn't find how to send this connection request using aries-cloudagent-python - is this already possible, are there any examples available?

Hi Michael - I'm not sure.  I'll check with the devs on this.  I imagine what you are seeing is that a connection ID is required on the API call, but since it is supposed to be implicit, it shouldn't be required.  I can confirm, or I can just raise an issue.

Hi
</p>
<p><strong>notsteward</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 05:25:48 GMT):<br/>
I have read this in docs,"A Steward can add one and only one Validator Node". Is this rule implemented?
</p>
<p><strong>sergey.khoroshavin</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 10:07:28 GMT):<br/>
Yes, for one DID with Steward role there can be only one Validator node. However if you're in full control of network (for example - creating test pool inside one organization) you can create and control as many Steward DIDs as you need for running as many nodes as you need. For an example you can look through scripts for creating test pool in docker, they are located in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/tree/master/environment/docker/pool
</p>

This is possible if your auth-rules are setup to allow it.  On the Sovrin MainNet not even the first transaction would be allowed since only a Transaction Endorser role (name was changed from Trust_anchor) can add a Transaction Author (NULL Role) to that ledger.  To check your auth-rules from the indy-cli run `ledger get-auth-rule`

The new indy-vdr component can be configured to run like that.  It has a configuration that can be used as a web service that you can call to interact with the ledger - read or write.  It is not the full indy-sdk and includes just what is necessary to interact with the indy ledger.

one request, and hopefully we'll get a chance to PR it in the future, but having a consistent well formatted JSON reply would be helpful.

Hello,
I tried starting with ACA-py but I found it too complicated to begin with, so I tried using Streetcred but even the tutorial seems to be incomplete. Whenever I try to begin with something I find myself lost inside all the repos out there. Is there a definite way or link to begin from? We want to make a mobile application to act as a wallet for credentials, but we're overwhelmed and can't find helpful steps. So can you suggest how to begin with Streetcred if the Javascript/C# code is unavailable? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Hello Guys,
I have a question regarding Agent to agent communication in hyperledger 
Q. Can Agents of one organization can communicate with other agents of other organization? If yes then how? Also which protocol they use to communicate?
@swcuswcurran sir can you please help me with this?
Thanks.

Yes, they can - using Aries agents and DIDComm.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 16:03:04 GMT):<br/>
To be more specific than that, I suspect that you need to do some learning about Aries, and defining your use case.  There is an edX course for learning about the general topic and about agents - https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-hyperledger-sovereign-identity-blockchain-solutions-indy-aries-and-ursa

If that is helpful, there is also an edX course about developing apps on top of Aries.

I am not using the app for issuer and verifier. I am just using it for holder. For me creating did, creating master secret, storing a credential received etc. was taking around 8s each. generating proof was taking more that 30s. This includes fetching the definition from the pool. However once I changed the key_derivation_method it all came to 3-4s. except for proof generation which took around 10s. 
</p>
<p><strong>ShamGir</strong> (Fri, 13 Mar 2020 09:14:28 GMT):<br/>
It seems interesting, I never faced this issue, in my Android app, I have all type of users (issuer, verifier and prover) in my sample app. But never face performance issue.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 17 Mar 2020 15:25:28 GMT):<br/>
Not 100% certain on this, but pretty sure.  Transactions are checked at the client and ledger and only the specific set that are explicitly defined are allowed.  The closest you can get to being "free format" -- and maybe this would work -- is the ATTRIB transaction that you can associated with a DID. 
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Tue, 17 Mar 2020 15:56:59 GMT):<br/>
yes, you can store arbitrary data (either raw, encoded or hashed) in ATTRIB txn.

</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Tue, 17 Mar 2020 15:58:05 GMT):<br/>
Actually supporting a custom transaction family on a custom Indy Pool instance is a relatively easy task due to Indy Ledger's Pluggable Request Handlers
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 17 Mar 2020 16:00:16 GMT):<br/>
Agreed -- that's been demonstrated a lot :-).

But not on a standard deployment.  E.g. the out-of-the-box Indy, or on Sovrin Mainnet.  I was steering @HLFPOC away from a custom ledger.

@swcurran @andrew.whitehead Does ACA-Py supports ATTRIB txns ?

@andrew.whitehead 
> I think the ledger rejects any attrib that isn’t named ‘endpoint’

That should not be the case, and I'm pretty sure we have tests for non-endpoint attributes.
Have you seen such behaviour? If so, this is a bug, and it's worth a ticket. 
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 17 Mar 2020 16:06:01 GMT):<br/>
It can automatically publish the endpoint when it detects a change, but no custom attribs 
</p>
<p><strong>ashcherbakov</strong> (Tue, 17 Mar 2020 16:07:25 GMT):<br/>
FYI: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/indy_node/test/api/test_attrib_reply.py#L25
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 17 Mar 2020 16:10:29 GMT):<br/>
So @andrew.whitehead - we need to add an issue for ACA-Py to enable that?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 17 Mar 2020 16:15:11 GMT):<br/>
Hm, looks like it might only have additional restrictions when the attrib is named endpoint. The value does have to be a dict for raw attribs though
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 17 Mar 2020 16:15:11 GMT):<br/>
Hm, looks like it might only have additional restrictions when the attrib is named endpoint. The value does have to be a dict with one entry for raw attribs though
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 17 Mar 2020 16:19:19 GMT):<br/>
"it" in that case is the ledger, right?  ACA-Py has the "endpoint only" restrictions?  So we need to loosen those?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 17 Mar 2020 16:21:04 GMT):<br/>
We could try adding other methods to fetch or publish an attrib

OK - I'll add the basic issue to the repo and we'll see where that fits. I'll tag it with help wanted for now.

Does indy-vdr need the issue as well, or does it just take what it is given?

<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Wed, 18 Mar 2020 06:39:21 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman I'm reading your latest article on the evernym blog. There you write "ZKP-oriented credentials are fully capable of supporting public non-repudiation, like their simpler counterpart. If the verifier and prover agree that a proof will be non-repudiable (e.g., in the case of the mortgage), then the proof makes non-repudiation enforceable through the cryptography. This is, and always has been, the default behavior of the ZKP-oriented credentials in Hyperledger Indy."  The latest sentence was surprising for me. Can you explain how this works or point me to a resource?
</p>
<p><strong>ajayjadhav</strong> (Wed, 18 Mar 2020 13:08:43 GMT):<br/>

That's great to know @danielhardman . Do you think it can be achieved using the delegatable credential approach ? (RFC 104) 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 18 Mar 2020 14:51:58 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that would be one way to do it. It could also be achieved more simply, by just giving the digital file to a new person (no protocol, just file copy); whoever has/uses the file first gets to watch the movie. There are ways you could combine this with exclusivity so it can only be held by one person at a time (e.g., by embedding in the cred a reference to something that's harder to transfer than a digital file, that must accompany the transfer and use).
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 01:35:57 GMT):<br/>

Just read the doc and have a similar question.  What exactly does (a) the verifier track and (b) what do the present to show non-repudiation to a third party?

This is a pretty important question given some of the use cases that I've seen for Indy - notably the consent receipt mechanism that relies on the creation and presentation of a proof as a demonstration of consent.

It turns out that what I wrote in that doc is not completely accurate. The assertion that we are non-repudiable by default IS accurate; I just explained it wrong. (In my defense, I was repeating what a crypto engineer told me. I'm now asking for a deeper answer that I can share. Don't give up on me...)

Hi everyone! I'm trying to build the state trie for the Pool state and I'm not getting the right root hash. My hunch is the key value pairs I'm adding to the state are probably different from what's there in the actual network. Can anyone out there help me by sharing the pool state (i.e. all k-v pairs in it) for buildernet please? That would help me reconcile the differences
</p>
<p><strong>gnarula</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 00:02:27 GMT):<br/>
So far, I've been using the logic in `plenum/server/request_handlers/node_handler.py: NodeHandler::update_state()` to update the state by parsing all pool txns. Am I missing something?

I am studying Hyperledger Indy in there I tried getting started in nodejs wrapper but when I running it is failing on the following point.

`    assert(await indy.verifierVerifyProof(jobApplicationProofRequestJson, decryptedJobApplicationProofJson, schemasJson, credDefsJson, revocRefDefsJson, revocRegsJson));`
The error which is I am getting this point is,

`IndyError: AnoncredsProofRejected`

Can someone help me to figure out where the issue is?. I tried a lot to find out it but I was unable to do so that is why I am looking for your help. All other commands up to this point in getting started.js. Thank you very much.

Hi All, Is there any way to recovery my wallet if I forgot the `wallet_key`? Like in bitcoin wallet we may get `six` word for recovery purpose. Is there anything like that?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 15:53:40 GMT):<br/>
The Indy wallet has a recovery seed. Some applications wrap that seed with a six word recovery, but that isn't something that Indy standardizes.
</p>
<p><strong>hyper-sunder</strong> (Fri, 27 Mar 2020 04:16:53 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 27 Mar 2020 05:02:20 GMT):<br/>
I was wrong. The seed isn't for the entire wallet, but for a specific DID key.

</p>
<p><strong>iamShashvat</strong> (Fri, 27 Mar 2020 09:05:26 GMT):<br/>
you can open your wallet and use api like 'listmydidwithmeta' which return all the keys.

What are you interested in testing?  For example, some are interested in ledger performance, but you can issue 1M credentials with just 3 transactions on the ledger and reads by the agents receiving them.  Do you have a use case in mind that you want to understand?

Hello guys, what would the best practice to store pictures, like a picture as an attachment to a VerCred ? As an embedded attribute(strongest in my opinion), using some king of encoding (Base64) ? Thanks 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 29 Mar 2020 21:36:44 GMT):<br/>
That can and has been done.  It will get better/easier when we move to Rich Schema with typing of claims.

An alternative that can be used in some cases is to put a hash of the image data in a claim and then have the image elsewhere.  Depending on the data, it could be stored in a public location.  In that case, you might use a hashlink to indicate both the location of the data and its hash to prove it has not been tampered with.  You could also store it on IPFS in that case.  If the data is private, it's harder to handle.  In that case, the verifier needs to get the data from somewhere - the issuer or the holder in most cases.

It's technically OK if it comes from the holder, as the hash of the image has been committed to the credential. The logistics of the holder getting it, keeping it and making it available to a verifier is NOT so easy though.  

With the issuer holding it, there needs to be some sort of authorization (ideally from the holder) for the issuer to release the image to the verifier.  This also results in a "call home problem" (the issuer knows the holder used their credential).

You don't have to interact with libnullpay, vcx loads it up during its initialization. Just make sure the compiled binary is on your system ( `/usr/lib/` on linux, `/usr/local/lib/`)

I've not heard of anyone doing anything with Caliper and Indy.  Since Indy doesn't use (for the most part) the blockchain for large volumes of transactions, performance has not been as big an issue, so it hasn't been a big focus. Some performance testing has been done on Indy and for the time being, performance was deemed sufficient and not a big focus.

OK - sorry I'm not familiar. The error seems to be that trying to connect to the ledger didn't work.  Is the genesis file correct?  Is it being read?  Are the nodes of the ledger you are trying to use publically accessible - or at least from the JS code that you are running?

Those are general thoughts.  Sorry I can't help further... :-(

It looks to me like your pool has been corrupted somehow.  Is it your own test pool?  If so, one way to fix it is that you can start over by deleting all of the ledger data (unless you need the data for some reason). Stop indy-node, delete the contents of the `/var/lib/indy/<network-name>/data` directory from each node and then restart indy-node on all of the nodes.  This suggestion is more of a quick-and-dirty "workaround" than a fix, but it's quite difficult to determine the real fix through this chat channel and if your merkle tree is actually corrupted, there might be no other choice anyway. :)

The directory i suggested to remove is on the nodes,  not in your windows client.  If you don't control the nodes,  then I don't think you can fix a merkle tree problem. About all you can do from the client side is `pool delete`, then `pool create` to try again...

The genesis file you are using appears to have local IP addresses in it, so that is not likely to be publicly available.  I am not sure what you are trying to test, but it looks like you are trying to use someone else's pool.  You could try the Sovrin BuilderNet if you are looking for a public test pool. That pool requires you to add your own schemas/cred_defs/etc.  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/master/sovrin/pool_transactions_builder_genesis

You should be looking at Aries.  Aries embeds in Indy and enables interfaces with other ledger and verifiable credential implementations.

It is a very active set of projects and in regular use.  Depending on your use case, you might look at different repos.

I updated to libindy 1.15.0, but still I get the same error (https://postimg.cc/mcyzL50q). I also tried to pre-create the needed folder and set world-wide read/write permissions on it, with no luck. Has anyone had the same problem, and been able to find a solution?

My team and I have developed an [SSI digital wallet] that works on the top of Hyperledger Indy to issuer Verifiable Credentials. Currently, we are using an internal ledger that is hosted on Google Cloud Platform and we would like to move to the Sovrin Network. We made this decision because we are trying to assist the country of Iraq with the COVID-19 crisis by issuing digital credentials for patients, they’re one of the countries that do not have any means to identity people who have been tested/vaccinated.

We have developed the digital wallet (mobile app), the web-portals for (issuers & verifiers). We would like to have the credentials issued on the Sovrin Network.
So I was looking for any advices or recommendations you may have based on your experience with Sovrin. We are paying out of pocket for this project as NGO and non-profit organization so your assistance will be a tremendous here. Please see the diagram below for our setup.

I would like to know things like,
Are we making the right decision by considering Sovrin?
What is there a way for Sovrin or someone else to give us a rough estimate for the cost, I know the pricing are available on the Sovrin’s website but wanted to see if I can get more details?

Thank you kindly,
Haydar

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 06 Apr 2020 22:53:39 GMT):<br/>
It's relatively easy to determine the cost based on:

- the number of issuers you have,
- the number of unique schemas you will be supporting,
- the number of credential definitions you will need (number of issuers of each schema)
- the revocation model you will use.

The next challenge you will have is actually writing to the ledger. That has to be done by having you and an endorser (usually a steward) sign the transactions to be written. That is quite a painful sequence right now.  We have an example of the steps if you are interested.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 06 Apr 2020 23:44:28 GMT):<br/>
If you can provide those numbers, we can figure out the costs.

Currently I am thinking about piloting this application to about 18 provinces in Iraq, each province will have (2) issuers. We are still debating the number of schemas but think we will need (3) schemas initially: A. schema for people tested negative, B. people tested positive. not sure about the credential definition and the revocation model.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 17:11:17 GMT):<br/>
For reasons we're trying to clarify, predicates other than ">=" have not been implemented.  We're not sure if there is a technical reason for that and we're trying to determine that.

Without additional predicates (notably "<") you can't do the type of test you are wanting to do as a predicate.

</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 19:00:57 GMT):<br/>
Transactions typically have a latency of ~1 second. Sometimes under heavy load it is as much as a handful of seconds. While that time is elapsing, I suppose you could consider the status as "pending". However, from the ledger's perspective, the transaction is atomic -- either committed or not.

Further, ledger writes are generally not time sensitive.  When you are an issuer (the only participant that needs to write), the writes should be done during a provisioning stage, not operational.  Even revocations are likely to be a batched vs. real time process.  However, revocation is the closest to a real time operation.
</p>
<p><strong>notsteward</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 19:16:04 GMT):<br/>
Pardon me @swcurran "the writes should be done during a provisioning stage, not operational" can you please tell what do you mean by that?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 19:16:32 GMT):<br/>
@notsteward: they're part of issuer setup. They don't need to happen on an ongoing basis.
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 19:16:47 GMT):<br/>
They only happen once (or a handful of times) at the beginning.
</p>
<p><strong>notsteward</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 19:29:58 GMT):<br/>
Oh! I guess we are not on same page, let me put it in different way.
In other consensus, like POS we have miners, they mine batch of transactions and commit it on blockchain. If mining is getting delayed, it simply give the status of "pending",with a (hash/Uid) by which in future.. client application can look to status for(successful or failure).
Basically Non-blocking system.
But in Indy if submitter submit some transaction in reply it directly get success or failure (basically have to wait it transaction complete)(Blocking system)
</p>
<p><strong>notsteward</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 19:30:43 GMT):<br/>
Let me know if you get it?
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 19:41:25 GMT):<br/>
@notsteward: Indy does not use a proof-of-work mechanism for consensus. Instead, it uses a byzantine fault tolerant consensus algorithm. This means there is no such thing as a pending state like there is in bitcoin. A transaction gets submitted. The nodes talk amongst themselves to come to consensus on it (which takes a second or two). Then the transaction is committed, once, permanently, globally, instantly, forever. You don't have to wait until more blocks get committed to achieve high confidence that it can't be undone. Therefore there is nothing like Bitcoin's pending status.
</p>
<p><strong>notsteward</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 19:48:34 GMT):<br/>
Thank you daniel and swcurran, My main confusion lies with RBFT then, So basically every transaction done quickly no long waiting period like POS/POW consensus! Thanks for resolving my confusion!
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 19:49:24 GMT):<br/>
(This is a major reason why Indy was created. It's purpose-built for identity, and its consensus uses this alternate mechanism instead of proof of work so there is no significant latency and no pending status on transactions.)
</p>
<p><strong>notsteward</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 19:50:33 GMT):<br/>
This is true USP! Thanks..
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 07 Apr 2020 20:29:44 GMT):<br/>
And with all that - back to the, ledger transactions are rare.  To be a first time credential issuer, you have between 2 and 4 transactions and then you can issue 10 or 1 million credentials - no further writes needed.  If you revoke credentials, there is a write, but that is likely to periodic - e.g. daily.  What's important is you are not doing a ledger write per app level transaction.

How to connect to indy mainnet? So that I can do transactions on mainnet.
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 14:59:39 GMT):<br/>
You can connect to the Sovrin MainNet (Sovrin's production Indy network) using this genesis file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/stable/sovrin/pool_transactions_live_genesis  
MainNet write transactions require an Endorser and there is a small fee for each write.  To become an Endorser yourself, you must sign the Endorser agreement, then the Trustees will add your Endorser DID to the ledger. 
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Wed, 08 Apr 2020 15:48:17 GMT):<br/>
One reason for 2 ports is to avoid DDOS attack from client side causing problems for Node/consensus communications.  The Node port is for Node communications only and is recommended to be firewalled such that only other nodes can use it.  The Client port is open to the world for access to read from and write to the ledger.

By "ordinary DIDs" I meant DIDs that aren't used to issue credentials. All ordinary DIDs can be off ledger. Putting ordinary DIDs on the ledger is not allowed on the Sovrin MainNet (because they are PII which can cause legal problems in some jurisdictions), but might be allowed in other instances of an Indy network.

Greetings everyon. I am going trough the Python samples in this url: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/docs/how-tos/write-did-and-query-verkey/python/utils.py   I have seen that for the DID creation and all other ledger actions, the ledger interraction is bein local with DOCKER containers, the 4 ones. I have now got test tokens for the Sovrin Builder Net. Does anyone knows similar Python samples from Sovrin so that one can play around with the "pool" of Sovrin builder net or staging and to do writes there and not on the local indy Docker nodes? Thanks in advance,
</p>

An update to this. I've looked through the code in the indy-sdk and it looks like there might be more predicates supported - per this line:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/ebdf1b62b4b744b94155cb6f032367540b33556c/libindy/src/services/anoncreds/prover.rs#L324

There are no test cases in the sdk for the other predicates (other than GE).

We're going to do some experimenting to see if it actually works.

It is often the case that if you implement some of the comparison operators, others can be implemented by reversing the operands. That may be why tests only cover one? (Still, we should fix this.)

Hello fellow indy devs, I've released and just redeployed new version of Indyscan https://indyscan.io/ 
Brings some nice UI/UX improvments, most notably live updates on homepage. No need to refresh page anymore. Enjoy.

Hello guys,
the German government is supporting open-source projects similar to the summer of code from google. For that, I would like to work on Hyperledger. The start will be July. I need a mentor and an idea for content I can contribute to the open-source project. I'm an experienced fullstack dev, worked with Etherum and have a knowledge of other Blockchains. Is there anyone that can help me find a topic I could work on? Highly appreciate you help
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 18:33:10 GMT):<br/>
We should be able to find something in Indy and Aries.  Could you provide some more information on what you would like to do?  Are you familiar with Indy/Aries?  There are multiple levels to the Indy/Aries/Ursa stack, and so where you might fit would depend on your interests and background.
</p>
<p><strong>rickkce</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 18:38:14 GMT):<br/>
Indy is a very interesting project for me. I have already dealt a lot with the topic of digital identity. Among others the Cosmos SDK with Tendermint and other SDKs that try to make a ledger for KYC an industry standard. 
The idea would be to find a topic here, so that I can apply for the scholarship with it and then to get familiar with Hyperledger Indy until July, so that I can start directly in and work on it until September.

</p>
<p><strong>rickkce</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 18:39:07 GMT):<br/>
I have previous experience with other Blockchains so it should be no problem to get into Hyperledger until July
</p>
<p><strong>rickkce</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 18:40:34 GMT):<br/>
Its a three months program
</p>
<p><strong>rickkce</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 18:41:03 GMT):<br/>
but I'd like to keep working on it afterwards 
</p>
<p><strong>rickkce</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 18:41:14 GMT):<br/>
So the program is good to kickstart it
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 20:08:05 GMT):<br/>
The thing with Indy is that the blockchain layer is relatively light - it is not used as much as other ledgers.  With Indy, the exchange of credentials is the high volume interaction and that is all off chain.  So if you specifically want to work at the blockchain level, there is not a lot going on.  We could find something, but right now, not a lot.

There is more at the crypto level if you are cryptographer, or at the ledger client layer.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 20:09:23 GMT):<br/>
So, if you are wanting to do Blockchain with Indy, I would think about the performance tradeoffs of the current implementation (Plenum) with other comparable approaches (e.g. Tendermint).
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 20:09:52 GMT):<br/>
There has been some investigation into that, but it has slowed down - no one to work it.
</p>
<p><strong>rickkce</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 20:10:54 GMT):<br/>
To work on cryptography is also interesting to me. However I see the potential here to work with Tendermint 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 20:10:55 GMT):<br/>
The volume of writes will go up in proportion to the number of issuers*credential types (not credentials).  That will eventually pressure the ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 20:11:04 GMT):<br/>
I'
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 20:11:04 GMT):<br/>
I'll try to find the conversations about that...will take me a bit to do that, but let's follow up on that.
</p>
<p><strong>rickkce</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 20:11:22 GMT):<br/>
Thats seems to be a very interesting topic to me
</p>
<p><strong>rickkce</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 20:12:15 GMT):<br/>
I just found out about the scholarship and have to apply in 7 days
</p>
<p><strong>rickkce</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 20:12:28 GMT):<br/>
Do you think that is enough time to define the topic and find a mentor?
</p>
<p><strong>rickkce</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 20:12:46 GMT):<br/>
The program then starts in July like I said so there is enough time to discuss more in detail about it later
</p>
<p><strong>rickkce</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 20:14:54 GMT):<br/>
I just need to write a 2 page proposal which is easy for me since I'm experienced with Blockchain
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 20:15:03 GMT):<br/>
Maybe.  I would not be best if the focus is at that layer.  But let's see.  Take a look at this:

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vs_wWhSCRlEMA9RdS4bGUn8XIcsHUKK8t7Nw2qf6w8A/edit#slide=id.g45e53a55e3_0_0

And scan the #indy-ledger-next channel for the discussion.  Focus on the "plenum" vs. other options.  There is some talk about DNS and things that are not very relevant - skip that.
</p>
<p><strong>rickkce</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 20:15:04 GMT):<br/>
And a statement from the mentor
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 20:15:59 GMT):<br/>
Suggest adding a question on that channel.  I'll check with others as well.
</p>
<p><strong>rickkce</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 20:16:30 GMT):<br/>
Okay I'll have a better overall look on the topic tomorrow and will go through the google doc so we can follow up 
</p>
<p><strong>rickkce</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 20:16:39 GMT):<br/>
Thank you very much for the help!

`client request invalid: InvalidClientRequest(\'validation error [ClientAttribOperation]: not a valid hash (needs to be in hex too) (hash=0x00)`
I am setting 'raw' value in buildAttribRequest(DID, DID, hash, raw, enc) (my golang wrapper), hash and enc are (optional), so I have to set it with null, if I set it null(0x00) I got this error! any solution please?

yes, agreed! and I am trying for the same... like JS, java, etc have null! in golang does not have predefined null or None.

</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Sun, 12 Apr 2020 20:56:09 GMT):<br/>
Or somehow the public key on the ledger doesn't match the key in the wallet

<p><strong>iamShashvat</strong> (Sun, 12 Apr 2020 21:17:32 GMT):<br/>
I have checked the public key, it's correct and matched with the ledger! I guess signature is not correct. How can it be possible, any more possible cases where signature can get invalid? 
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Sun, 12 Apr 2020 21:27:14 GMT):<br/>
Does the output match what you're passing to SignRequest?

Signatures are sensitive to the order of the keys but it should handle that automatically

 @andrew.whitehead @swcurran Do you have maintainer privalages on the indy-node/indy-plenum repos? If @esplinr team is out for the month we should not halt progress in these repos
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 14 Apr 2020 14:46:13 GMT):<br/>
I'm completely comfortable using GitHub issues for the new repos (i.e. indy-vdr). I'm a bit nervous with indy-node and indy-plenum because there are lots of good information in Jira that it would be sad to lose.

Earlier I asked the question about signature mismatch while submitting the request. I found out that the signature is invalid because of reqID in the response of BuildAttribRequest.
Basically, I hardcoded the request and just change the reqID value with previous transaction's reqID and submit it. It's a successful transaction.  
How is this possible?
whenever we build a request for NYM/ATTRIB etc we get reqID(Unique ID number of the request with transaction).

</p>
<p><strong>iamShashvat</strong> (Wed, 15 Apr 2020 19:08:29 GMT):<br/>
Suggestion: In NodeJS wrapper there should be bigInt handling for reqID(transaction), currently it makes the last two digits zero. 
example:
Generated by library: 1586764515258869234,
In NodeJS: 1586764515258869200.

It creates a problem when your server in node js and your client in some other language.

possible problem: Signature Mismatch! (I faced it)

@danielhardman @domwoe - I tried to add this to the thread we had going, but got an error.  To continue the thread from the second document that Daniel posted:

I don't think the document answers the original question.  The only statement in the second document about non-repudiation is this assertion `NIZK proofs are considered non-repudiable, because the verifier can share the proof in a convincing way; sharing the mathematical construct provided by the prover is enough`

Why is that assertion true about NIZK Proofs?

What do I have to save to be able to show a non-repudiable statement from the prover?  In practical terms, what do I have to show in court?

Thanks

Hi, Can anyone please explain or share some docs about Indy/Aries Threat Model?
a) What's the Threat Model for Hyperledger Indy/Aries?
b) Where is Indy/Aries most vulnerable to attack?
c) What are the most relevant threats?
d) What do I need to do to safeguard against these threats?

Hi, when i was looking into Indy Node i had a doubt. If only trustees, stewards or trust anchors can add a new Identity Owner, how does a new user establish a peer-to-peer connection given that his DID is not yet in the ledger?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 20 Apr 2020 16:10:43 GMT):<br/>
Aries agents do that using Peer DIDs - a DID method that is exchanged between participants, but not stored on the ledger.  I did a video of that awhile back that explains it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKH7vjp_P9o
</p>
<p><strong>RicardoPeixoto</strong> (Mon, 20 Apr 2020 17:04:44 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran thank you for your response. From the video i got one more question:
1- How to send the DID Doc safely to the other entity? More specifically, how to prevent someone from pretending to be Bob or even man-in-the-middle attacks?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 20 Apr 2020 17:13:17 GMT):<br/>
The first message is sent plaintext, the rest are encrypted, so it is the first message that is at risk.

The approach that must be taken in that scenario is that you assume you don't know who you are talking to once the connection is established. You have a new, secure channel to talk to someone. After that, you need to find out who you are talking to via verifiable credentials.

In other words, when there is a plaintext channel used to establish the connection, find out after the connection has been made to whom you are talking.

We had a good Indy Contributors call today where we talked about:

- updates on the latest progress on the various sub-projects, including indy-vdr, indy-shared-rs, deprecating indy-crypto and Aries secure storage
- migration from Jira to Github Issues (we will, with lazy copying of open issues from Jira), 
- migration from Jenkins to GitHub Actions (we're getting started...)
- initial discussions about the design for handling revocation 2.0 merkle trees on the ledger

Hi all for those who are not connected over at DIF where I placed a similar message in the claims and credentials working group, we (Mattr) will be demoing a new digital signature approach to ZKP capable verifiable credentials at IIW that have the following properties. 

- Do not require credential definitions so hence are ledger agnostic i.e only require a did on a ledger
- Assertion format agnostic (i.e you could render them as a JWS or linked data proofs) we will be showing how to use with linked data proofs (i.e JSON-LD)
- More performant due to the underlying crypto used (ECC based rather than RSA)
- Smaller in size also due to the change in crypto primitive used e.g (ECC based rather than RSA)
- Verifiable credential spec compliant

Following this we will be open sourcing a reference implementation along side a specification for the scheme

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Tue, 21 Apr 2020 15:25:14 GMT):<br/>
you can pass `method_name` parameter when creating a did. You can also unqualify and qualify a did using the same parameters.

<p><strong>GKumar</strong> (Tue, 21 Apr 2020 15:29:23 GMT):<br/>
So it mean schema could be multiple name for a given trust-anchor even though ledger is same
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 21 Apr 2020 16:17:13 GMT):<br/>
The short answer is that you can't do that arbitrarily in an Aries agent unless you have full support for the DID method "xyz" (whatever that is).  You need to understand the DID Spec. and DID Methods to do that.

I'm wondering about what you are trying to do -- why you want to do that.  My guesses:

1. You want to use a different DID method.  For that, you have to write an Aries interface to that ledger -- a process that is not well understood.  You would be pioneering.

2. You want to reference a different instance of an Indy network other than Sovrin.  That is currently only possible at start times of agents, when you load the genesis txns of the ledger to which you want to connect.   This is something we need, but not currently standardized.

Am I right with my guesses?  Something else?

</p>
<p><strong>GKumar</strong> (Tue, 21 Apr 2020 16:21:10 GMT):<br/>
Hi @swcurran  Thanks a lot for detailed answer. I was just playing around indy and aries. I completed the deployment and connections. Finally I thought of why don't we start something with my own *method *name. :pray:

Implementer’s Call Invite

Just a reminder about the Identity Implementer's WG Call tomorrow morning (April 23th @ 9am MT). This is a chance to get updates on the WG calls you may have missed this week.

Our guest will be Pico Labs (@sanbachs from BYU) who will present their research into Verifiable Credentials.  They will be giving a system demonstration for how they can be used to conduct commerce.

Here is the calendar invite with times and Zoom details.

Hi All, I was wondering what would be the consequences if in a SSI network, only DIDs of credential issuers were stored in the ledger, while personal DIDs would remain only in wallets of individuals. Relationships are established using pairwise DIDs anyway, so I think the only drawback would be that a private DID owner would not be able to designate a service endpoint, thus any interaction with a persona would require that wallet owner is on-line. Am I missing something? Can you please explain or point me to a place that elaborates in detail about this topic?

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 17:19:42 GMT):<br/>
That is reasonably correct. However, an owner can have a mediator agent that can queue messages for when the wallet owner is online.  Those messages are encrypted by the sender, so the mediator agent just knows to whom they are going.  This is necessary for all mobile agents, and can be used by any edge agents.  See the RFC for Mediators and Agents here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0046-mediators-and-relays

There are several related RFCs about queuing, routing, etc.

Hey folks - interested in contributing to Indy Revocation 2?  We have posted a couple of Help Wanted issues for tech spikes into our revocation plans. These are for one or two standalone programs (any language!) to test out the ideas we have for revocation - think of them as assignments you would get in a Computer Science class on algorithms and data structures.  If you can spare a 1/2 to 1 day to help out, that would probably do it!

Issues are here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/issues, with the ones I'm talking about tagged with "Help Wanted".

Questions welcome, contributions even more so!

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 21:34:16 GMT):<br/>
I think the summary of the document is that a ZKP (and likely any) proof is non-repudiable if the claims within it are sufficient to be trusted by a third party.  The verifier passes the proof to the third party, the third party verifies it and they see both enough information in the claims and they trust the issuers of those claims. So it is not that the ZKP is non-repudiable it's the content of the proof.  As you say, nothing magical about the ZKP at all other than that it makes the claims within authoritative from the issuers through to the 3rd party.  That makes sense. It has the ramification that a verifier wanting non-repudiation has to collect more information from the prover, and must preserve that information.

Thanks.  BTW - I've seen another product recently that aligns really nicely with the LOA 3 that you describe in the doc.  It would be a great generic addition to wallets.  I'll share more about it one of these days...

> think the summary of the document is that a ZKP (and likely any) proof is non-repudiable if the claims within it are sufficient to be trusted by a third party.

I'd summarize it almost this way, but with this nuance: it's not just general strength of claims. What makes a proof non-repudiable is whether the claims *bind the proof to the prover* strongly enough that the prover can't deny having made it. With interactive ZKPs, this is never true, because the verifier of the proof could game the binding. With non-interactive ones, this problem doesn't exist.

For those going to IIW, I went to the orientation session today and it was worth the time. The platform is an IIW-style Open Space running on top of Zoom. If you have been to IIW and know Zoom it will make sense, but worth going to the orientation. The platform is pretty cool!

how do I add a node to indy pool running as docker containers?
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Tue, 28 Apr 2020 14:52:18 GMT):<br/>
It should be the same process as for adding a new node to any network. Similar to the instructions found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18MNB7nEKerlcyZKof5AvGMy0GP9T82c4SWaxZkPzya4/edit#heading=h.9a4ud1gh7a6x 
Was there a specific issue or problem that you were running into that we can help with?  The new node does not need to become part of the genesis file.

Hi, when I create keys on Sovrin using the universal registrar, it returns the private and public key in Base58 format. Any guidance on how to use these in NodeJS? The crypto.sign function expects them in pem or der format... Or would it be better to use something like tweetnacl?

I have been trying to follow the SelfServe instructions at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sXZoN18lpFoAF075QoptofwDV_1otUylPGFKRQnA56E/edit  so that I can issue some builder net tokens but I come unstuck just after creating the DID using indy-cli.

<p><strong>jcourt</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 09:17:52 GMT):<br/>
Is there some way of verifying the indy-cli is able to talk to the ledger ?  I thought about using 
"ledger get-fees payment_method=sov" since I figure that will need to talk to the ledger but that is returning Unknown payment method.

<p><strong>jcourt</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 09:22:03 GMT):<br/>
The little bit that niggles me is there is a step that talks about building libsovtoken but I can't find anywhere in the indy-sdk where that lives anymore ?  So I am suspicious that the payment method fails because that library is missing but it still doesn't explain why indy-cli has connected to a  pool happily and indicated it created a did yet I can't fetch it and there are no errors.
</p>
<p><strong>jcourt</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 11:43:55 GMT):<br/>
So I was able to verify that I could perform a ledger get-nym on someone else's existing DID so it must be something to do with the "did new" that I am not understanding rather than a pool connection issue.
</p>
<p><strong>jcourt</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 11:43:55 GMT):<br/>
And I think the answer is I am mis-interpreting step V.B of the self serve instructions.  Clearly the DID isn't written at that point to the ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>jcourt</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 11:53:00 GMT):<br/>
And once I found where I could get a libsovtoken to build its all happy again :-). Sorry for the fire drill
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Wed, 29 Apr 2020 14:00:03 GMT):<br/>
Yes, the DID is only in your wallet at that point.  In fact, that is where most DID's in the world will stay.  DID's rarely need to be written to the ledger under the Indy way of thinking. In most use cases, the only DIDs that have to be on the ledger are those that are used to write to the ledger.

Hi all, I have run into a blocker and been banging my head since.
REQUIREMENT - I want to run postgres with the aries-dotnet framework
SOLUTION - I figured it can be the same as it is done with python-cloudagent. Basically load the library before calling any wallet functions and indy-sdk will take care of the rest
PROBLEM - I didnt find any dll for indystrgpostgres and decided to build from source. I followed the steps exactly for building libindy for windows and the image build out without any errors but I get "Unhandled exception. System.BadImageFormatException: Bad IL format." when I try to load the library using "AssemblyLoadContext.Default.LoadFromAssemblyPath".
REASON - I want to run mediator for large number of users and hence need HA and thus need a better common wallet storage for multiple instances of dotnet mediator containers running

Any solution to the problem will be really helpful

Because you don't have the requirements installed, particularly the python3-indy module but you would need indy-sdk for that to work. It's designed to run inside docker though where the webserver container can easily find the verifier nodes

I think the 'Layers' its referencing there is a part of indy-plenum. I'm not going to debug running the webserver this way right now, it works in docker.

Jumping on this thread a bit late, but ...
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 20:47:31 GMT):<br/>
(1) if you want to run the webserver local you need to install indy-plenum
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 20:48:03 GMT):<br/>
(2) you can run the docker version of von-network and have it available from localhost as follows:
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 20:48:53 GMT):<br/>
`./manage start 192.168.0.11` (substitute your own local IP)
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 20:50:03 GMT):<br/>
(note that if you do this then you cannot connect to your Indy nodes from within another docker container)
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 20:51:00 GMT):<br/>
If you try this, you can connect to your local `http://localhost:9000/genesis` and you should see your local IP's in the genesis transactions
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:04:28 GMT):<br/>
I'm using Ubuntu Image on AWS
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:05:07 GMT):<br/>
and want to run von-network (don't really care how), and want to make it accessible publicly  
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:05:54 GMT):<br/>
the reason why I'm installing von-network is to make a private network in which I can run my Aries Agents
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:06:28 GMT):<br/>
so a private network available publicly?
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:06:36 GMT):<br/>
(private as in for you personally)
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:07:15 GMT):<br/>
for private I mean we don't want for now a sovrin network but want to create our own
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:07:35 GMT):<br/>
the trick is with the IP addresses of the nodes ...
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:07:57 GMT):<br/>
you have to be able to connect (from your agent) using the same IP address that the node itself is using
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:08:10 GMT):<br/>
... because the IP address is in the genesis transactions
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:08:37 GMT):<br/>
with AWS can you specify the exposed IP address?
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:08:42 GMT):<br/>
I got it (i actually know that I need to change the IP in genisis file)
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:08:59 GMT):<br/>
yes (for AWS)
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:09:24 GMT):<br/>
Changing the IP in the genesis file will just make it not match the merkle tree
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:10:00 GMT):<br/>
ok here is my environment (let me explain my problem)
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:12:38 GMT):<br/>
We have Web Agent and Mobile Agent based on Aries dotnet. We want to create our own private network (node, ledger etc) and for now don't want to use Sovrin Network. We are going to host that on AWS machine in Ubuntu environment. What we want is to connect these Web/Mobile Agent with our private network.
Questions are how to create our own Private Network and to connect the Aries Agents with this network?

... I've sent a note to the devops guy (Wade) to find out where he keeps his configs
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:20:07 GMT):<br/>
and we actually want something like this
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:20:14 GMT):<br/>
@ianco thanks
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:20:25 GMT):<br/>
My limited understanding of this is you just have to make sure the Indy nodes are running on the same IP's as they are published on
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:21:23 GMT):<br/>
okay and in genesis file there is a specific IP which is for Node
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:21:38 GMT):<br/>
what am I going to put there?
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:22:36 GMT):<br/>
and what is the best practice to run a private network (docker or webserver)?

</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:25:12 GMT):<br/>
... ok this is what Wade just told me:  Example; `./manage start 138.197.138.255 WEB_SERVER_HOST_PORT=80 "LEDGER_INSTANCE_NAME=BCovrin Test" "INFO_SITE_TEXT=vonx.io" "INFO_SITE_URL=https://vonx.io/"`
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:25:25 GMT):<br/>
the IP is the public IP of the machine
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:26:12 GMT):<br/>
... this is the end result of the VPS docs
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:27:06 GMT):<br/>
I'll go one better ... @WadeBarnes 
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:27:38 GMT):<br/>
We haven't tested with thousands of issuers, but we've issued millions of credentials on a single issuer
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:27:54 GMT):<br/>
for aries agents we connect them with pool
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:28:10 GMT):<br/>
which is through genesis file 
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:28:30 GMT):<br/>
which genesis file would I need?
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:28:39 GMT):<br/>
There are only a small number of ledger writes (public DIDs, schemas and cred defs)
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:29:06 GMT):<br/>
Once you start the network you can get the genesis file from `http://<your IP>/genesis`
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:29:14 GMT):<br/>
so for every Issuer we need to create a new ledger?
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:29:25 GMT):<br/>
okay got it
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:29:51 GMT):<br/>
No, for each issuer you need to write a new DID to the ledger, plus any schemas and cred defs for credentials that issuer will issue
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:30:04 GMT):<br/>
When you issue a credential nothing is written to the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:31:21 GMT):<br/>
'we've issued millions of credentials on a single issuer' to reference ur quote, I mean that if I want multiple Issuers?
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:32:18 GMT):<br/>
can I have multiple Issuers and everyone can Issue unlimited credentials
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:32:25 GMT):<br/>
on this 1 network?
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:32:32 GMT):<br/>
will that be enough
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:32:32 GMT):<br/>
will that be enough?
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:32:51 GMT):<br/>
yes issuing credentials is not limited by the network
</p>
<p><strong>davidd</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:33:21 GMT):<br/>
okay, because Scalability is our concern (and it should be)
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:34:15 GMT):<br/>
We run our applications on openshift, and each component scales independently ...
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:34:41 GMT):<br/>
So obviously when you are issuing millions of credentials there are scalability concerns and bottlenecks, but nothing related to the Indy network
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 01 May 2020 14:51:42 GMT):<br/>
Indy SDK supports the crypto to use peer dids (creation, storage, pack and unpack of messages).  How those DIDs are used is a higher level abstraction - an Aries thing.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Sun, 03 May 2020 19:23:21 GMT):<br/>
Yes, you can pass the seed into `create_and_store_my_did` or `generate_wallet_key`
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Sun, 03 May 2020 19:23:21 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>iamShashvat</strong> (Sun, 03 May 2020 20:13:58 GMT):<br/>
@andrew.whitehead but what if I dont have seed? 
let's say according to an architecture, a old service creates a crypto keypair(ed25519) using crypto.js library(without seed) and if I want to use that keys for Indy requests to sign, I have to make a copy/import of keys in indy wallet.
Is that possible? 
Can I use  import_wallet() in anyway to store those keys?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Sun, 03 May 2020 20:15:21 GMT):<br/>
If you have the private key, the seed is the first 32 bytes. If you don’t, then I don’t see how you can import it 
</p>
<p><strong>iamShashvat</strong> (Sun, 03 May 2020 20:52:05 GMT):<br/>
@andrew.whitehead size of the private key(indy/ED25519) is of 32 bytes so if I put whole private key in `create_and_store_did` as seed I must get the same keypair, is it?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Sun, 03 May 2020 21:03:09 GMT):<br/>
Give it a try 
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sun, 03 May 2020 21:58:26 GMT):<br/>
Looks like the secret key is the first 32 bytes of a sha_512 hash where the seed is the input to the hash function. I don't think that key will be recoverable to be passed into indy_sdk.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sun, 03 May 2020 22:00:37 GMT):<br/>
With that in mind, if you really need a key to be put in IndySDK you can sideload it, but it's a painful process that you'll have to look through the codebase to understand and be able to perform, but it's not impossible.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sun, 03 May 2020 22:00:37 GMT):<br/>

There are parallel Presentation Request "standards" efforts with Digital Bazaar (W3C CCG) and DIF. Both look on the surface like they have fewer features than the Indy Presentation Request format - particularly the Digital Bazaar one.  It also looks to me that the differ significantly from one another.

Digital Bazaar Proposal: https://digitalbazaar.github.io/vp-request-spec/
DIF: https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/

Questions:

1. Is there a concise document that describes the Indy format as it exists today that can be used as a measuring stick against the others?
   - Some of the "Indy-isms" may need to be translated, but it would be interesting to see if the concepts in the Indy format are present in the other two.
2. Is anyone from the Indy community involved in either of those efforts?


</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 00:47:26 GMT):<br/>
As for question 1, I don't believe so. One major thing worth noting is the RFCs defined are describing an entire protocol where as those are more just about the request format and are combined with other pieces of the puzzle (such as CHAPI) to go through the verification flow.

As for 2, I've been keeping an eye on both of those. I believe @brentzundel was helping out with the DIF one initially, but unsure of his level of contribution now. The DIF description is further along as far as a spec stands, and offers methods that will be more obvious how selective disclosure is done. With regards to the DB approach, this can also be achieved, but the object would need to be defined. 

It's entirely possible that the DIF object is defined as a JSON LD object that defines a selective disclosure query that could be put in the attachment of RFC 37 [Request Presentation object](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0037-present-proof#request-presentation) or in CHAPI as has been done so far in the DHS interop work.

Agree that the deliberately RFC does not define the Indy presentation request format.  The Indy format is well defined, I'm just looking for a document that we can share with the other communities.  We've used it a lot in many different ways, so it's extensive.

What I want to be sure is that we list the concepts that are covered in the Indy one, including a mapping to JSON-LD concepts.

The two specs jump straight into examples without describing what should be supported.

I was pretty heavily involved in the initial architecture of the DIF presentation definition, but am not able to continue participating.
I'm not sure where things stand now, but at the time it looked like what they were specifying would probably be something that we could use with Indy and Aries.

It's an asynchronous call so the result takes as long as it takes. Is there a reason you're using C? You could await the result much more naturally in javascript or python
</p>
<p><strong>notsteward</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 18:27:59 GMT):<br/>
I have to use it in C due to some limitations, So how can I handle these asynchronous call in C?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 18:35:10 GMT):<br/>
This is a general programming question not really an indy question. There's a ton of ways you might implement it depending on what you're writing. You might want to create separate threads for each call and join the thread when it completes, for instance. In C++ you might be able to use std::future
</p>
<p><strong>notsteward</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 18:37:40 GMT):<br/>
Yes, sorry! I understand this is not indy based question I just wanted to know if someone had implemented before using C.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 18:42:34 GMT):<br/>
It would be good if there were examples in C to look at, but I'm not aware of any

<p><strong>notsteward</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 18:47:28 GMT):<br/>
I  have a doubt regarding keys in indy, please correct me if I am wrong:
1.) Indy creates the ED25519 keypair then it encode it in base58, out of which the first 16 bits of the publicKey/Verkey is DID
2.) signature: Ed25519 digital signature! 
                      Is it encode into base64 after signature generation?

Hi, is there some way to query all records of a given type in "openWalletSearch"? I tried to pass an empty query "{}" but it did not return any records. If i do the simple query by id it works just fine.
</p>
<p><strong>notsteward</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 19:11:48 GMT):<br/>
You can do listMyDidsWithMeta ( wh ) where wh is wallet handle! it will returns all the DID present in your wallet.
</p>
<p><strong>notsteward</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 19:12:23 GMT):<br/>
@andrew.whitehead please correct my understanding.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 19:13:33 GMT):<br/>
I don't think you can find anything without at least the record type identifier
</p>
<p><strong>RicardoPeixoto</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 19:14:32 GMT):<br/>
There are options to query like mongoDB but i want all records from a type without filters
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 19:14:33 GMT):<br/>
Are you talking about indy_crypto_sign?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 19:15:37 GMT):<br/>
This is the nodejs wrapper I assume
</p>
<p><strong>RicardoPeixoto</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 19:16:14 GMT):<br/>
Yes you're right.
</p>
<p><strong>notsteward</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 19:16:22 GMT):<br/>
yes create_and_store_did, create_keys, crypto_sign yes!
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 19:18:50 GMT):<br/>
I think that should work. Not sure if it expects the query as a string or as inline JSON
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 19:19:46 GMT):<br/>
Then I believe it returns the raw signature in bytes, not encoded as base64
</p>
<p><strong>RicardoPeixoto</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 19:22:06 GMT):<br/>
I passed as inline JSON like they have in the example: {}. The quotes were just to represent the exact thing i passed.
</p>
<p><strong>RicardoPeixoto</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 19:23:07 GMT):<br/>
I can probably tag all records of that type with a specific value and query by tag but i was looking for a cleaner way.
</p>
<p><strong>notsteward</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 19:23:59 GMT):<br/>
sign_request encode in base64? and what about first point, is that correct?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 19:25:56 GMT):<br/>
Yes that's how it derives the DID, although you can specify a custom one instead. sign_request sets the signature property of the message. I believe that one is encoded in base58

Has anyone ever tested with the indy-sdk docker (ledger) running on an AWS ec2 instance? 

Normally, I run the test ledger docker locally.  However, I wanted to do some network tests and so I built a docker on AWS.  For testing simplicity (on the client), I'm using the indy-sdk Java sample.

While connecting to a local docker works fine, when I try to open to the AWS-based ledger pool (Pool.openPoolLedger(poolName, "{}")), I'm getting timeout errors.  When building / running the docker, I set the IP to be our local AWS instance's IP. In the client, I set the testPoolIp to our AWS instance's external address.

If any of you have tried this, is this the right setup?  
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 21:38:08 GMT):<br/>
Not sure if you are asking about indy-sdk or indy-node (ledger), but assuming indy-node.  We run von-network on Digital Ocean so quite similar.  There is some docs on doing that - https://github.com/bcgov/von-network#running-the-network-on-a-vps

@WadeBarnes has a lot of experience in doing that, so may be able to help you debug a bit -- especially if you are using von-network as a basis.  It's the easiest way to run a ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>mccown</strong> (Tue, 05 May 2020 21:57:36 GMT):<br/>
You're correct, my question is really an indy-node question masquerading as an indy-sdk question.  :-)  

Many thanks for the doc, it looks like my answer is in the "Running the web server in Docker against another ledger" section.  I'll do some reading and then likely have some questions for Wade.

@WadeBarnes I'm not a docker developer and I think my question is more of a docker question.  I'd be grateful for any insights you might have.

Within the Indy SDK, there are instructions for building a docker that runs 4 indy-node instances.  I've been using this locally to test some client apps and now I'd like to move it to an AWS instance to test some mobile clients.  

I was planning to move the docker to AWS and forward my client traffic there. 
 However, it appears that dockers (internally) control the network traffic and seem to be blocking non-local traffic.  Do you know of a straightforward way to enable a docker accept non-local traffic?

To confirm, you're wanting to set up an Indy Node ledger, for test purposes, that is publicly available?  Like this; http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io/
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 12:35:15 GMT):<br/>
If that's correct, it's super easy using `von-network`.  It creates a network of 4 Indy Node instance plus a ledger browser.  `test.bcovrin.vonx.io` is one such instance we maintain.

</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 12:43:31 GMT):<br/>
In the example above `138.197.138.255` is the public IP address of the host machine.  That's the part that tells the network to listen on the public address and not the internal one.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 12:45:39 GMT):<br/>
You will also need to ensure ports `9701-9708` are open on the machine.  Indy Node and it's client's use ports 9701 through 9799 for communication.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 12:47:35 GMT):<br/>
In this case `von-network is only using `9701-9708` since there are only 4 nodes.  Each node, as you may know, uses two ports; one for admin traffic, and the other for client traffic.

Can someone please expand on the notion of endpoints in DID documents?  If what I'm understanding is correct, these should be the domain of the agent?  I've been looking through the demo docs/code, but haven't found where/how these are defined?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 22:06:15 GMT):<br/>
The endpoint is a URI where you would send a message to the agent.  That might be an endpoint controlled by the agent itself, or it might be the endpoint of another agent that serves as a mediator, passing on messages received to the intended agent. Think of it as the entry point to the domain of the agent.  The endpoint can be any addressable point using supported transports - a URL, a websocket, an email address (if an agent supports that).  The endpoint combines the address and the protocol - e.g. a URL.

In Indy, an endpoint for a public DID is set via an "ATTRIB" transaction on the ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>jameshiester</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 22:32:40 GMT):<br/>
Do the original nodes from the genesis block have to remain online, or can new nodes be bootstrapped from nodes that are added later
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 22:54:26 GMT):<br/>
AFAIK - at least some of them need to be online - not all.   Technically, a new genesis file can be created with some or all of the current nodes and used just as well.  However, as part of the governance structure, you do want to keep that static so people don't have to determine if they trust a new version of the genesis file all the time.
</p>
<p><strong>jameshiester</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 22:57:56 GMT):<br/>
is this done anywhere in the samples currently?  
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 22:58:40 GMT):<br/>
ACA-Py does that, but I'm not sure where.  I'll take a look.  I don't think the demos do that.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 23:09:52 GMT):<br/>
Hmm...weird.  Just spun up an agent to look at the ACA-Py API and there does not seem to be a request the controller can make to do that. However, there is in the code a way to set the endpoint.

@andrew.whitehead -- could you fill in the blank on that?  Is it because the the endpoint is picked up with the start up parameters?


</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 23:10:21 GMT):<br/>
I suspect it is automatically set based on this start parameter:

```

  -e <endpoint> [<endpoint> ...], --endpoint <endpoint> [<endpoint> ...]
                        Specifies the endpoints to put into DIDDocs to inform
                        other agents of where they should send messages
                        destined for this agent. Each endpoint could be one of
                        the specified inbound transports for this agent, or
                        the endpoint could be that of another agent (e.g.
                        'https://example.com/agent-endpoint') if the routing
                        of messages to this agent by a mediator is configured.
                        The first endpoint specified will be used in
                        invitations. The endpoints are used in the formation
                        of a connection with another agent.
```
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Wed, 06 May 2020 23:14:18 GMT):<br/>
The agent publishes its endpoint automatically when starting up or changing the public DID using /wallet/did/public

Hello Guys ,

I am new here , can you please assist me with documents or links on:
1. how to revoke your details(digital wallet) should there be any abuse by user or vendor ?
2. how information gets shared between user and vendor or relier in hyperleder ?

Thank you
</p>
<p><strong>tsekwena</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 10:34:46 GMT):<br/>
My question above is basically trying to find different ways in which revocation takes places between Issuer ,Prover and Verifier ?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 14:48:22 GMT):<br/>
Revocation is done unilaterally by the issuer by publishing a transaction to the ledger that revokes one or more issued credentials. When an issuer use that transaction or later, they are unable to create a "proof of non-revocation", and thus, the verifier knows that the credential has been revoked.  An overview of the current process is here - https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0011-cred-revocation.

Could you add some more context about that question?  
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 22:53:32 GMT):<br/>
Are you trying to see how to add a DID (and other objects) if you are not an endorser?
</p>
<p><strong>jameshiester</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 22:54:44 GMT):<br/>
I'd like to understand how I could initialize the network with the steward keys so that I can lock down DIDs.  I understand that's not really the use case for the repo, but even the start using docker documentation doesn't really address key generation currently
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 22:55:27 GMT):<br/>
Ah...I found the quote.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 22:56:26 GMT):<br/>
OK - in both cases, the DID is created by someone with authority and created with the appropriate permissions.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 22:57:55 GMT):<br/>
You want to be an author.  You create a seed and keep it secret - it must be treated the same as private key.  You use that to create a DID in your wallet - possibly using a UI, or just using Indy CLI.  In doing that, you get the nym (the DID) and the verkey (public key).
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 22:59:26 GMT):<br/>
You give those two public pieces of info to someone who already has rights to the ledger.  They use a UI or the CLI to execute the transaction to write the DID to the ledger.  Done - you have your DID.  It's easy because they don't have to write the DID to the ledger, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 23:00:30 GMT):<br/>
A UI like the "Authenticate a New DID" on the http://dev.bcovrin.vonx.io/ site can be used.  Note that on that you can set the permissions you want.
</p>
<p><strong>jameshiester</strong> (Thu, 07 May 2020 23:02:12 GMT):<br/>
I guess what I'm trying to accomplish is hosting the network in the cloud like the bcovin is doing, but controlling the keys such that there is not an option for others to use the ui or api to create a did with the endorser role without going through me
</p>

<p><strong>jcourt</strong> (Fri, 08 May 2020 00:13:47 GMT):<br/>
My understanding is that you have to create that chain of trust from a Steward down to an Endorser.  Only if you provide an open service that "Allows" people to become an Endorser is there a risk of DID Write attacks.  Some networks set up for testing like the Sovrin Staging allow this as a public service for developers but your own Indy Ledger instance wouldn't have to. 
</p>
<p><strong>jameshiester</strong> (Fri, 08 May 2020 00:37:57 GMT):<br/>
My understanding is the same.  I like the convenience of the VON setup, but there's steps missing from making it a controlled network.  It would be nice if the steward seeds could be configured via args in the setup script (for both VON and the indy node) so you could easily create your own secret keys.  I know there's helper scripts in plenum, but with the lack of documentation it seems like quite a slog.  
</p>
<p><strong>jameshiester</strong> (Fri, 08 May 2020 00:38:59 GMT):<br/>
is this the correct seed for the genesis transaction steward?       'seed': '000000000000000000000000Steward1' (taken from the getting started story docs)
</p>

did you check your security group rules?
</p>
<p><strong>jcourt</strong> (Fri, 08 May 2020 00:53:19 GMT):<br/>
Yeah so I think the issue is that they are listening on a 0.0.0.0:Port but trying to connect to their peers via the public IP ?
</p>
<p><strong>jcourt</strong> (Fri, 08 May 2020 00:56:35 GMT):<br/>
Its pretty likely security related
</p>
<p><strong>jcourt</strong> (Fri, 08 May 2020 02:02:59 GMT):<br/>
@jameshiester it was the EC2 security group wasn't allowing the nodes to access the public IP.  Thanks !

@jcourt, would you be able to submit a PR to the `von-network` documentation with some "Pro-Tips" for what you had to do to get it to work?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 08 May 2020 14:59:25 GMT):<br/>
Good idea.  We deliberately left the BCovrin sandboxes open, but it's bitten us a few times when people have decided to play with adding nodes to the ledger and breaking consensus.  It's  not a huge problem for us, but we'll be locking down the steward key at some point to prevent that on the open networks.

If you do get that done, a PR or issue to von-network to document what you did would be appreciated.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 08 May 2020 15:02:24 GMT):<br/>
A prod network is locked down such that the issuer has to go through an endorser to get their DID.  There are other forms of DDOS attacks (e.g. bogus write requests, read requests), and those would be handled as in any enterprise.  The network uses two network interfaces with one exposed to the dangerous world, and then other one only open to the other nodes on the network for internal communications.  That should remain open and useable in the event of a DDOS.

Is there any scenario using Indy network to implement KYC(or Know Your Customer)? What I want specifically is a simple scenario like this. An identity owner (usually a person not an organization) signs a document with his key and then others can verify that the document is signed by that person. It seems hard to implement because we usually do not know who the identity owner is in real life and the anonymity of the SSI avoids correlation between the identity and the real person.

It sounds like you would need a common schema issued by trusted issuers (probably a white list of supported credential definitions), and at least one of the issuers would have to issue a credential confirming that the holder has signed the document. That issuer would know who they are, but presumably wouldn't share the information

Help Wanted request:

The BC Gov team had been planning on doing the initial work for converting the Indy CI/CD pipelines from Jenkins to GitHub Actions. However, priorities have shifted in the past few weeks and the resources expected to be available for that work are going to be working on other Trust over IP priorities for the foreseeable future. As such, that work is back to being unassigned.

If anyone has the expertise and time to do that work, the community would greatly appreciate it.

<p><strong>conanoc</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 01:45:50 GMT):<br/>
Is there any reference document or discussion thread related to what you mentioned?

When the issuer issues a credential confirming that the holder has signed the document, it could not verify that the holder really signed the document. The signature should be the one owned by the holder not the issuer.

But, the idea of introducing a third party who knows the personal information but keeps it secret sounds good. Thanks.

@conanoc  I am trying to understand your mentioned KYC use case. Why do not get verifiable credential (VC) directly from trusted issuer, like a "gov passport authority" and use it to prove identity in KYC process? 
</p>
<p><strong>conanoc</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 10:20:00 GMT):<br/>
Let's assume "gov passport authority" issued a passport to Alice. I am an insurance company and want to make a travel insurance contract with Alice digitally. It would be nice if Alice can use the digital passport or something from her SSI wallet to sign the contract.

I can verify it's Alice who sent me the signed document by verifying her passport before receiving the document. But I cannot verify that the document has signed by her private key because Alice might have signed it using Bob's key.

<p><strong>Audrius</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 11:13:25 GMT):<br/>
@conanoc  I guess for a use case clarity we need to separate technical and legal parts of "sign the contract" meaning. From a technology and my point of view that could be: Alice is identified by "passport VC" and Insurance company could organize confirmation/signature of the contract (or just record in their DB) in a way they are happy with that. They know, that was Alice, which proved her identity. As example Alice’s “signature” could be issued VC by her. She is ok with the contract No123 from Insurance company xyz. That is technology part. 
The legal part to "sign the contract" could be more complicated, mainly it depends on a particular country law. I am not sure if Indy will cover all possible use cases from a law point of view. In this particular Alice case if law is requiring "contract signature" between supplier and customer, first of all, VC should be a part of legal regulation. Based on that any VC issued by Alice could be treated as a legal action. Without VC legislation signature by VC will be not legal.
As per my opinion legal part is most challenging in “digital” KYC implementation. That is one of the reasons why EU with already legal “electronic signature” solution (eIDAS) proposing gateway approach for a quick solution between SSI and existing eIDAS. From a legal point of view If you sign VC with already legal e-signature your VC should be treated as a part of legal regulation. Sorry for the long text…

@Audrius I agree that the legal part is more complicated and vary from country to country. I am concerning the technical part for now.

You mentioned that "Alice’s signature could be issued VC by her". But the problem is that Alice cannot issue a VC because she is not an endorser or a trustee in the network.

Without signing, what we can make sure is that Alice has visited the web site and read the document. She may have agreed or disagreed and marked it in the web site. But the DB record could verify nothing.
This is a simple digital signing scenario and I might be wrong to title it as "KYC".
</p>
<p><strong>Audrius</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 07:19:08 GMT):<br/>
@conanoc Alice could issue "contract signature VC" without trustee and network. Maybe in this case use VC naming is confusing, however based on verifiable ID she could sign/prove her decision, for Insurance company.

NOT A LAWYER :-)

In most places I know of, a sufficient "digital signature" is a declaration of agreement by a known entity. More simply put, having a web session where the person "logged in" and agrees to sign (acknowledge by some act) is sufficient.

So, if the session with the user can be verified by the provision of a proof from a trusted authority, that will be good enough, and much better than the existing techniques.  Currently, what you do is login and then over share data such that the other party (insurance company) is "pretty certain" that you are the person you say you are.  They mitigate their risk.  With VCs in the game, they can collect far less data if they can trust from whence the credential was provided.

<p><strong>tsekwena</strong> (Wed, 13 May 2020 17:54:25 GMT):<br/>
Is there any method/tutorial i can follow to do  a POC for a revoked credential and proof of non revocation ? 
</p>
<p><strong>conanoc</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 01:51:22 GMT):<br/>
I agree that most of the web services work like that. Users login and do some action and type password once more if some action is sensitive, type secondary password or do fingerprint verification on their phones and so on.
I'm just thinking about some other process using SSI, including digital signing if possible.

@Audrius I didn't know that anyone can issue credentials. It will be great if we can just correlate the proof record of the passport VC and the credential issued by Alice. I suppose the two artifacts both signed, or can be signed, by the same key.
</p>
<p><strong>Audrius</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 08:16:59 GMT):<br/>
@conanoc I would recommend to check Aries RFC 0257: Private Credential Issuance. In relation to the "agreement signature" scenario could be worth to check 0234: Signature Decorator or RFC 0066: Non-Repudiable Signature for Cryptographic Envelope

A document signed with the same key as used to convey a proof should be a strong mechanism.

Hello everybody,
After some trials of nym request, I found out that the role of the DID which signs the transactions is only checked after the COMMIT messages (and fails if it does not have the privilege to write on the ledger). Can anyone explain me why the check of roles is not done at the same moment than the signature check, it means before a node sends a PROPAGATE message? Thanks

This might be a dumb question, I'm doing a project for uni using hyperledger indy.
We are using the NodeJs wrapper.

While trying to get things up and running, we're following along with the to-do documents.

First we create a pool ledger using createPoolLedgerConfig(poolName, poolConfig).
Then we try to open the pool ledger using openPoolLedger(poolName, undefined).

This results in a PoolLedgerTimeout (307) error.

Anyone know why this happens?

I've already checked, and the pool does exists.

Hi, I see you mentioned Angular, so I guess you're trying to npm install indy-sdk  and run an Angular app in the browser right? I'm afrad it won't be possible because indy-sdk is only for Node.js runtime because it relies on native libindy binary to be available in your operating system.

Has anyone installed libindy on Mac OS Catalina? I upgraded last week from Sierra and now the libindy dylib fails with a missing dll. I suspect libsodium has been quarantined by Catalina and this is causing my issue. I have tried various things, such s re-compiling libsodium (v1.0.12) and re-building libindy. But still no go. Any advice gratefully accepted ....

Hi, I managed to build and run the indy-sdk on catalina last week following the Mac OS instructions. Maybe upgrading broke some of the packages installed with homebrew. I'm new to this so don't have any detailed knowledge about exactly what the issue might be but I would try going through the MacOS build instructions and ensuring the dylib is in your path if you haven't already.

Hey, I've been running through some of the "how tos" in node and noticed that there were a few errors and the node examples were missing for a couple of them. I've ported the missing ones from python to node and got some fixes for other examples. I'm happy to do a PR for these if it would be helpful. The contributing guide says to create a ticket but I didn't want to do that before confirming if it would be a welcome contribution. Let me know and I'll contribute when I have a moment.

When a holder receive an issued credential than can be later revoked, To present a prrof it must construct the revocation state and access the tail file, as a result when i attempt to present a proof i get "Error when constructing revocation state -Invalid len of bytes representation for PoingG2". how can the probe access the tail file and what are the steps required for a credential check of non-revocation

This week's Indy Contributors call will mostly be about how we can enable dynamic access to multiple Indy ledgers --- allowing an agent (for example, a Mobile Wallet app) to access multiple Indy ledgers in a single session with minimal effort from the agent owner. An example for those that have used the Streetcred and esatus wallets: using both Sovrin Staging and Sovrin Mainnet without having to switch the settings over and over. We'll also cover the latest progress on Revocation 2.0 work.

The call is Monday, June 1 at 8AM US Pacific, dial-in information: https://zoom.us/j/244779296 Agenda can be found here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/indy/2020-06-01+Indy+Contributors+Call

The reason the contributing guide asks for an issue is to help evaluate if a contribution will be welcome before writing code. What you briefly describe here sounds useful, and if you've already got a PR ready you can just submit it.
Also, the contributing guide is a bit out-of-date. We used to use a Jira-centric workflow, but now are now keeping our issues in GitHub.
Thank you for your interest in improving Indy!

I don't know how the values in your example are created. But acording to the indy sdk how to issue a credential it is the decimal representation of the SHA256 hash value.
See: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/docs/how-tos/issue-credential/java/step4.java

In that example there is "male".
The SHA256 hex value of "male" is 0d248e82c62c9386878327d491c762a002152d42ab2c391a31c44d9f62675ddf
Converting the hex value to decimal results in 5944657099558967239210949258394887428692050081607692519917050011144233115103.

Good Morning, Hope everyone doing well. 

I am trying to play around with aries-mobileagent-xamarin I have setup the mediator and successfully make a connection with cloud agent by scan the qr code. the cloud agent offer a credential to the mobile agent. When I am trying to request for accept the credential from the mobile agent I am getting the following error...

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 14:49:14 GMT):<br/>
Not sure what you mean, so I'll give two answers.  If you are looking for detailed status info on a validator node, yes, that has to be signed (permissioned).  If you are talking about doing a read operation from the ledger, no, that does not have to be signed (public).
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 15:35:44 GMT):<br/>
Validator info includes some sensitive information about the nodes like what package versions they're running, so the request can only be submitted by (I think) a steward
</p>
<p><strong>jameshiester</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 21:55:50 GMT):<br/>
do the same wallet credentials always open the same wallet handle?  If so, does the wallet have to be open to call signAndSubmitRequest?
</p>
<p><strong>shubhamparasher</strong> (Fri, 12 Jun 2020 08:07:19 GMT):<br/>
yes, the same credentials are required to open a wallet which were used while creating it. The wallet handle returned after open wallet is required to sign and submit any transaction or request, hence the wallet needs to be open at the time of submitting any request that requires signing with private key.

Has there been any interest in a network visualizer? I've been working on a node.js/typescript/react implementation similar to BC Gov's work.  I was thinking it would be cool to see a visual representation of the transactions, something like a force directed chart: https://www.amcharts.com/demos/collapsible-force-directed-tree/.  The idea would be to show the nyms, schemas, and cred_defs as nodes, with each type as a different color, and then link them together using the transaction history.  Might be an interesting way to illustrate the network of trust

Hi all, I am using Aries Framework to build the agent, and I always encounter the first time failed issue, below are two common happened scenarios, does anyone also encounter this before? Thanks.
1. The first time when I create a new schema, then it returned Ledger operation rejected 500 error, then when I create again, then it is success.
2. The first time when I retrieve all schemas, then it returned The ledger message is unknown or malformed. 500 error, then when I refresh the page, the schemas were returned successfully

hi @swcurran  @tomislav, here are few questions:
1) Where does private and public key stores? in wallet? not on ledger?
2) What exactly stores in Wallets?
3) @swcurran , You once said "No data is sent to the Blockchain. Ever. It is only used for DIDs, schema/credential metadata and revocation information." What do u mean by metadata?
4) Can you please explain the credential verification flow, issuer-verifer-holder?
4a) Without having information about credentials (it isn't stored on ledger, only store in holder wallet), how will verifer confirms (verify) that these credentials are same as they were issued by issuer? I mean what if holder received credentials, changes later, how will verifer/issuer know that?

@brentzundel It looks like the latest indy-node brings in indy-plenum 1.12.3 which still depends on indy-crypto
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 16:50:35 GMT):<br/>
I added the current master to our requirements.txt as `git+https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum.git@a5941cb9d9faea4601ba2ad4e8c5fc070d5075df#egg=indy-plenum`, and with ursa-0.3.2 preinstalled it seems happy
</p>
<p><strong>brentzundel</strong> (Tue, 23 Jun 2020 20:09:40 GMT):<br/>
the plenum version I bump to in my indy-node PR removing indy-crypto is 1.13.0.dev1024.
The latest stable plenum release still uses indy-crypto

If you are talking about the the Sovrin ledger - indyscan.io.  If you are talking about using it on your own ledger, the von-network browser can be deployed to point at any ledger.  I think there instructions in the repo for that -- let us know if you can't find that.

<p><strong>MrWoody</strong> (Wed, 24 Jun 2020 17:14:32 GMT):<br/>
If a startup wishes to use SSI using Hyperledger Indy, what is the recommended approach? a) Create it's own ledger using a pool of Indy nodes (on company hardware or somewhere in the cloud), or b) Use a central standard provided ledger (such as Sovrin or other)?
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Wed, 24 Jun 2020 17:44:08 GMT):<br/>
Hi Mike,  It looks like the plugin is not loaded for you.  If that is the case try adding something like this to your cli config file `"plugins": "/Users/lynnbendixsen/github/libsovtoken/libsovtoken/target/debug/libsovtoken.so:sovtoken_init"` or run the load-plugin command from the CLI to load it each time you start up.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 24 Jun 2020 20:48:24 GMT):<br/>
The answer depends on how interoperable you want to be.  If you will have a closed systems of agents and users, then you can run your own.  You can definitely do that for developers and for limited proof of concepts.  If you want a wider ecosystem, and want to (for example) allow users to bring their own mobile wallet (e.g. Trinsic, esatus or Evernym), you have to use a ledger that they support (or convince them to support your network -- which might be tough :-) ). In that case, Sovrin is the place to go.  Oh, and Sovrin would work for the "closed ecosystem" as well.

Hi - some newbie questions - 
is there an implementation (library/framework etc) - for using a wallet in a mobile phone? The intent is that the user is truly in-charge of the identity... thus, has the wallet in their mobile app (rather that being stored in some backend). We want to associate users biometeric idendity (face scan) to use the wallet.
this leads to another question - are there ideas/implementations in this case (wallet in mobile) for identity (wallet) recovery?
</p>
<p><strong>raish</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 07:45:03 GMT):<br/>
another set of questions - re identity consumption ... we want a website to be able to 'consume' a SSI created on Indy .... is there some material to read on how to implement this (protocols, any ref implementations) etc.

<p><strong>rileyphughes</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 13:05:06 GMT):<br/>
To add to Stephen's answer, esatus and Trinsic wallets both support adding your own network via genesis txn file. So as long as the users in your closed ecosystem are highly technical, that is an approach as well 😊
</p>
<p><strong>rileyphughes</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 13:05:40 GMT):<br/>
Frankly I'd recommend just using Sovrin because it's already there, and there's no need to do any additional work to get it up and running and stable.
</p>
<p><strong>rileyphughes</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 13:07:49 GMT):<br/>
Yes, the Trinsic wallet is an edge wallet with backup. We built the framework used to make the app and contributed it HL as #aries-framework-dotnet. An open source reference mobile app using that framework is found at https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobileagent-xamarin

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 15:24:15 GMT):<br/>
Sorry, I don't have experience developing with the .net framework, seems like it could be signing ledger requests before the DID is registered perhaps

There's a version of that in aca-py using pynacl: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/7bdae139195561449fcd636d8a4934ee47b51a9d/aries_cloudagent/wallet/crypto.py#L77
</p>
<p><strong>jameshiester</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 16:22:15 GMT):<br/>
yeah, I would like to see it in the base sdk so it can be used with the other wrappers too, like nodejs.  Makes me nervous as DID methods evolve there would be multiple places to maintain the same basic function.
</p>
<p><strong>jameshiester</strong> (Fri, 26 Jun 2020 16:22:56 GMT):<br/>
I think the same function was also implemented in von-network, so there's already a lot of duplication happening

Hi, according to the documentation Indy can reach consensus with 1/3 +1 of the nodes available, but what I cannot find is if this also true when all the nodes are in the genesis file. In our tests with 6 Indy nodes, being all of them in the genesis file, if I stop 2 of them I can read from the blockchain but when I try to write (for example creating an attrib transaction or updating a DID endpoint) a timeout is raised using indy-sdk. Shall all the nodes in the gensis file be available, so only additional nodes follow the 1/3 +1 rule or we just made a mistake in our tests?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 29 Jun 2020 14:26:07 GMT):<br/>
To handle 2 faults, you need 7 nodes (f=2, 3f+1 = 7).  So your 6 node network can only handle 1 fault.  The genesis file is not relevant.

Hi All,

I am facing an issue while calling indy.verifierVerifyProof -- error is -- AnoncredsProofRejected ..
I am using nodejs indy SDK for development. Also can some help in understanding how the credentials are maintained in the wallet.
For instance, if a user gets credentials from two trusted anchors corresponding to their credentials definition, where both credentials defn. schema includes a common field or attribute, how are then that common credentials stored in wallet? for example, if grade attribute is common in both the credentials defn. will both be stored in a wallet with mapping with the corresponding trusted anchor.
Now if a third party (verifier) asks for the proof of grade will the grade will be picked for credentials defn required in the proof request by verifier or will indy.verifierVerifyProof -- throws -- AnoncredsProofRejected kind of error?
Thanks.

Kindly guide me!!!

yes, i read that.. the problem is that the pool on server (web agent) isn't configure properly, means can't access from phone (osma)

Hey everyone Good Morning. I am able to send basic message and receive the message in the cloud-agent via web-hook but trying to receive the basic message in the AMAX Mobile APP. But still fighting with this. I haven't found any test cases for this as of now. Can anyone please guide me on this. Thanks

Hi team, I got a query on Hyperledger Indy and Aries. I have worked with Indy for about 6 months. My question is that, every holder/user on the network is assigned a service endpoint which the user gets connected to. The service endpoint is a different port number for each user on the network. So would this architecture be scalable as we might be needing to assign identity to thousands, millions or billions of users at some later point of time. How Sovrin would be handling the IP address ranges to be assigned to the users/holders in future?

Is observer node not supported yet?? I saw readthedocs says "services (array of strings; optional): the service of the Node. VALIDATOR is the only supported one now."
</p>
<p><strong>san1ker</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 01:16:37 GMT):<br/>
My Indy network pool has 4 validator nodes. If Indy supporting observer node, Do I have to change or set pool config?
</p>
<p><strong>san1ker</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 01:23:08 GMT):<br/>
ADD) Other Node transactions with service [] or ["VALIDATOR"] are successfully being recorded to pool ledger. I cannot send only Node txn with service ["OBSERVER"]
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 07 Jul 2020 01:48:41 GMT):<br/>
Observer nodes are not yet supported. The validator nodes serve as the handlers of reads from the ledger.

There's no API for that in indy-sdk. You can have a look at the implementation of the did:sov driver for the universal resolver. How the indy-sdk can be used to generate a DIDdoc. https://github.com/decentralized-identity/uni-resolver-driver-did-sov

Hello good people,

Is anybody here familiar with the process for building libvcx for iOS?
I am using this article as a reference and I am stuck at the last paragraph:
https://dev.to/jakubkoci/how-to-build-a-vcx-ios-library-f32

"This still not over. To call output libvcxall.a library from our code we need to wrap it with Objective-C and c-callable headers. First, we copy the libvcxall.a to indy-sdk/vcx/wrappers/ios/vcx which contains these headers and then we use xcodebuild and lipo utility to create our final vcx.framework."

I'd appreciate any help,

The credential goes from the Issuer to the Holder, e.g. from the gov't (including SSN) to Alice.  Later Alice presents proof of the claims in the credential (some or all, possibly combined with claims from other credentials) to a verifier (say, Acme).  None of the data in the credential goes to the ledger. What goes to the ledger are metadata about the credentials (e.g. names of the claims - data elements) and cryptographic public keys needed in constructing the proof (by Alice) and to verify the proof (executed by Acme).

Team, what is the reasoning behind having 4+ ledgers for Indy? Just makes things more complicated than they should be imho
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 13 Jul 2020 23:03:10 GMT):<br/>
Each ledger fulfills a specific purpose.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 13 Jul 2020 23:04:18 GMT):<br/>
It looks like when someone experimented with the readthedocs integration, they forgot to update that link. It should point here:

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 13 Jul 2020 23:04:22 GMT):<br/>
I know about three of the ledgers and have a guess on the fourth:

- Domain is the identity transactions -- the DIDs (NYMs), Attributes of nyms, schema, credential definitions, revocation registries and revocation entries.  That's the "data" of the ledger.
- Config are the transactions that change the network. For example, to trigger updates to the software. I think (not certain) the authorization data is there as well.
- Node lists the nodes (current and past) that are participating in the validation.
- Fourth is optional (I believe) based on the configuration for a token that can be added to the network.

To see the transactions on an indy ledger, you can look at indyscan.io which has a ledger browser for each of the Sovrin networks (Main, Staging and Builder).

I understand that each one has a separate function, but it does complicate things. Like each ledger needs to have its own sync logic rather than having one ledger that has all the necessary logic. Are there documents/papers that describe the benefit of such scheme? The reason is that I am responsible for building a network for decentralized identity and need to understand the reasoning behind indy... I've played and delivered end-to-end solutions with Bitcoin, ethereum, hlf, and a few other ledgers. Indy is a bit new and still grasping the architecture.

Hello folks! I'm using Libindy from React-Native using the Java wrapper within Android (Indy 1.14.2). Upon trying to open a pool handle (openPoolLedger()), the app crashes with a signal 6 SIGABRT, with no other error messages. It crashes on the socket.connect() call, and since that uses zmq, that leads it to be my most suspected issue. I have enabled the internet and networking permissions for the app (as well as enabling cleartext messages in the manifest), and have ensured the call is being run in a separate thread from the main thread. I am open to any ideas anyone might have. Thanks!

Hi, I have a question about the Verkeys.
When I use the Indy-CLI to create a DID based on a seed I get a short verkey (~VERKEY).
The Full-Verkey on the ledger seems to be DID+VERKEY.

But when I create a DID using Indy-SDK with the CreateAndStoreMyDidAsync method I get a DID and a FULLVERKEY.

Now I would like to know how this looks like when using this DID based on the seed.
If I want to use a DID created with the Indy-CLI later in an application that uses the Indy-SDK (or Aries) or vice versa to sign transactions for the ledger, this might not work, because the verkey created in the application does not match the verkey on the ledger.

A note on key abbreviation and DID relationship. The DID is simply the first 16 bytes of the verkey, represented in base58. The abbreviated key, is the other lefotver bytes with a ~ prefix, so you can easily construct the full verkey by concatenating the the DID and abbreviated verkey.
When a user rotates their key for a DID and write that to the ledger, that key can no longer be represented in abbreviated form.

Hi team I have a question about anoncreds 1.0 VS 2.0
Using tails, revoc entry contains only index number (matched prime number is not exposed) so revoked information can be hidden.

But using merkle tree, as described in https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-2365, (I understood like 0010000.. -> cred with index number 3 revoked) 
index number is the only information (there is no matched hidden factor like prime number in tails) so I think anyone who has merkle root can derive revoked information of credential.

Is there any way to hide revoked information of cred with merkle tree(anoncreds2.0)?? 
thanks.

I am pointing to genesis file(local indy pool)  and trying to run the server at port 9000 ... But unable to run the same , I did install the packages . Any clue why I am not able to run the VON server  ?

Why does credential_def only store transaction seqNo.? I think it is better to store schema_id. Is there a reason for this implementation?

Devs can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's because the SDK allows retrieving by seqNo, but not by schema_id.  If you wanted to retrieve the schema given only the credential_def, there would be no efficient way to do so using only schema_id without having all the transaction history cached

Regularly a Timeout error is due to something with your IP addresses or networking configuration. Check your pool Genesis file first and then track it down from there.

Hi everyone... How can I dump the whole ledger transactions via de indy-cli?
</p>
<p><strong>MrWoody</strong> (Thu, 30 Jul 2020 22:32:53 GMT):<br/>
I need it to validate the ledger transactions after operations for testing
</p>
<p><strong>MrWoody</strong> (Thu, 30 Jul 2020 22:33:04 GMT):<br/>
and document the whole ledger transactions
</p>
<p><strong>MrWoody</strong> (Thu, 30 Jul 2020 22:33:10 GMT):<br/>
for now, I can visually do it with Greenlight
</p>
<p><strong>MrWoody</strong> (Thu, 30 Jul 2020 22:33:20 GMT):<br/>
but if indy-cli could do it, it would help
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 30 Jul 2020 22:52:00 GMT):<br/>
You could use the indy-vdr-proxy tool at https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-vdr
</p>
<p><strong>MrWoody</strong> (Thu, 30 Jul 2020 23:03:09 GMT):<br/>
Oh, another tool... ok, I'll take a look at it. No way to do it via simple indy-cli right?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Thu, 30 Jul 2020 23:04:05 GMT):<br/>
Not sure if it has a method to fetch transactions 
</p>
<p><strong>MrWoody</strong> (Thu, 30 Jul 2020 23:04:46 GMT):<br/>
Ok.. I'll try VDR in the meantime. Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 31 Jul 2020 13:17:04 GMT):<br/>
The `indy-cli` does not support dumping the transactions.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 31 Jul 2020 13:18:35 GMT):<br/>
As @andrew.whitehead has recommended `hyperledger/indy-vdr` is the right direction.

How is node naming/identification handled? Is the name guaranteed unique? Or would it be better to use the did/verkey as a primary key if storing in a db (though can't a node rotate their keys?)
</p>
<p><strong>jameshiester</strong> (Tue, 04 Aug 2020 15:49:04 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 04 Aug 2020 15:51:52 GMT):<br/>
I believe it has been there for a while.  It's just checking public information about all the nodes in the network.  @andrew.whitehead might know more.

</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Wed, 05 Aug 2020 15:51:41 GMT):<br/>
It's not an indy-node feature, we just perform a GET_TXN request against the individual nodes instead of VALIDATOR_INFO
</p>
<p><strong>jameshiester</strong> (Wed, 05 Aug 2020 15:55:10 GMT):<br/>
ah ok, and then an error response is equivalent to a node being offline? 
 for vdr, are there plans to add a status endpoint that shows nodes online/offline?  @swcurran alluded to as much
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 05 Aug 2020 15:58:19 GMT):<br/>
Not in indy-vdr, but look at indy-node-mointor, which is based on indy-vdr
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 05 Aug 2020 15:58:32 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>jameshiester</strong> (Wed, 05 Aug 2020 16:02:45 GMT):<br/>
ahh ok.  Personally I would say it's a little misleading that the '/' endpoint in vdr returns all nodes regardless of whether they're online or not.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Wed, 05 Aug 2020 16:05:25 GMT):<br/>
That's meant as more of a 'pool refresh status' page to see if it has the most recent pool transactions

Easiest way to run a local network is using von-network, which also gives you guidance on how you can run your own on bare-metal (which is not very useful IMHO - depends on your goals).

https://github.com/bcgov/von-network

BC Gov operates some open instances of von-network -- listed here (BCovrin links - https://vonx.io/clickythings/)

Closer to production are the three Sovrin networks - MainNet, Staging and BuilderNet -- https://sovrin.org

I think the Plenum protocol is what you're looking for:  https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/wiki#:~:text=The%20Plenum%20protocol,Ben%20Mokhtar%2C%20and%20Vivien%20Qu%C3%A9ma.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 06 Aug 2020 23:05:57 GMT):<br/>
You are correct that an Indy attack would have to take over 3f +1 machines to produce the BSL signature necessary to hijack the ledger history. This is because it is a permissioned ledger, versus a permissionless ledger like the Blockchain.

I'm looking to standup an Indy test network. I realize the Indy readthedocs site doesn't have current info for SDK ( even Python scripts ) on the sample scripts. Can someone point me to better documentation resources?  Is there a good end-to-end tutorial recommended that shows the Indy setup, creating a steward, trust anchor and issuing identities and credentials for individuals?  Thanks !
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 08 Aug 2020 20:12:39 GMT):<br/>
A good place to start to get a local network running is here: https://github.com/bcgov/von-network

It spins up a 4-node network for you, with a web interface that lets you create DIDs that can be used to create other objects.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 08 Aug 2020 20:15:35 GMT):<br/>
Unless you are planning to be an Indy network operator (which seems unlikely) manually setup an Indy network is not something you really need to know.  Interacting with a network is what's interesting --- either in building Agents (e.g. developing at the Aries level), or building agents for specific business uses -- issuers, holders and verifiers.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 08 Aug 2020 21:29:33 GMT):<br/>
Indy devs ( @esplinr ) -- How flexible are the configuration rules for writing transactions to the ledger -- e.g. rules like when an endorser/trustee/steward needs to sign a transaction to write (for example) a DID?  Notably, can the rules for writing a RevReg reference the owner of the CredDef to which the RevReg is to be written? Likewise, can a RevEntry be constrained to only be written by the owner of the RevReg to which the RevEntry is associated?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Sun, 09 Aug 2020 06:27:12 GMT):<br/>
The documentation is here:
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/transactions.md#auth_rule
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Sun, 09 Aug 2020 06:27:56 GMT):<br/>
It was intended to be flexible, but we didn't specifically address the Revocation Registry use case.

in a proof, how do the signatures show that the holder was issued the credential if the holder/creator of the proof is using a different did than the one to which the credential was issued (as in the case of two pairwise did connections)?

In Indy anoncreds, the holder provides the issuer a blinded link secret that is inserted into the credential before it is issued.  To prove the credential, the holder must prove (in zero knowledge) that they possess the link secret to unblind the the blinded link secret.  That proves that the entity that constructed the proof was the one to which the credential was issued.  When there are multiple credentials sourced into a single proof, all must use the same link secret.

The pairwise DIDs are only for secure communication. They are not used as part of the credential exchange process.
</p>
<p><strong>jameshiester</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 13:35:49 GMT):<br/>
also just to make sure, rotating keys would not affect that ability to unblind correct?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 13:39:16 GMT):<br/>
In anoncreds, you don't change the link secret --- it's held in the wallet and never exposed.  Rotating keys of the DIDs used for DIDComm has no impact on the link secret or the unblinding process.

In looking at the auth rules, and reviewing the ledger, I am pretty sure that a rev_reg_def is created at the same time as a credential definition by the same owner and is directly associated with that cred_def.  The auth_rules already indicate that any rev_reg "add"s or "edit"s must be done by the owner. `"need_to_be_owner": true` So, Yes, the RevReg entries's can be and are constrained to only be written to, by the owner of the cred_def/rev_reg_def.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:23:09 GMT):<br/>
The rules appear to be different for each ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:25:51 GMT):<br/>
For MainNet it looks like you need a privileged  DID in order to *ADD* a *REVOC_REG_DEF* or *REVOC_REG_ENTRY*
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:27:18 GMT):<br/>
What is the `owner` context for *REVOC_REG_DEF* txns?  I assume it would be the `owner` of the *CRED_DEF*.  Is that correct?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:30:28 GMT):<br/>
My thoughts:
- The owner of a *CRED_DEF* should be able to freely ADD/EDIT *REVOC_REG_DEF* txns for their *CRED_DEF*(s), and freely ADD/EDIT *REVOC_REG_ENTRY* txns for their owned *REVOC_REG_DEF*(s).
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:30:28 GMT):<br/>
My thoughts:
- The owner of a *CRED_DEF* should be able to freely ADD/EDIT *REVOC_REG_DEF* txns for their *CRED_DEF*(s), and freely ADD/EDIT *REVOC_REG_ENTRY* txns for their owned *REVOC_REG_DEF*(s).
- You should not need a privileged DID in order to do this.
- I would expect there would be some fee associated to writing these txns, similar to the way there is a fee for writing attributes.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:51:22 GMT):<br/>
The [Who Is Owner](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/auth_rules.md#who-is-owner) section of the *Default AUTH_MAP Rules* document does not list the owner in the context of the *REVOC_REG_DEF*.  How do we confirm the owner in this context?
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:51:40 GMT):<br/>
I can help explain the rules part of this. The rules I was referencing in my previous response were for the MainNet and they are mostly the same for the other networks.  The main differences are that on MainNet only an endorser can ADD a credDef/RegDef. This means that they are also the only ones that can ADD/EDIT entries or other related actions. A Transaction Author must find an Endorser to sign these actions for them.  This was done because Endorser was the role assigned to do all of the credential issuance type txn's while the ledger remains permissioned. Allof those txn's are fee based and are charged to the Endorser monthly.
I am almost certain that the owner context for RegDef txns is the owner of the RegDef. Since the reg def is created in conjunction with a credDef, the owner of the RegDef is the same as the associated credDef. This appears to be a 1:1 relationship and I am uncertain if you can make multiple RegDef's per CredDef.
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:54:15 GMT):<br/>
You can confirm "owner" type issues by trying things out on the BuilderNet, but I am pretty certain that "owner" always refers to the original signer of the TXN.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:54:33 GMT):<br/>
As I understand it you can have more than one *REVOC_REG_DEF* for a given *CRED_DEF* since the *REVOC_REG_DEF* only has limited use.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:55:25 GMT):<br/>
This is also the basis of my thoughts.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:55:25 GMT):<br/>
This is also the basis of my thoughts of the *CRED_DEF* owner being able to freely write a new *REVOC_REG_DEF* without the need to have the txn signed by a second or third party.
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:56:57 GMT):<br/>
That muddies the waters a bit then, but creating a RegDef for a CredDef that you do not have ownership of makes no sense.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:57:33 GMT):<br/>
Agreed.  That's why I'd like to confirm the `owner` context.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:57:33 GMT):<br/>
Agreed.  That's why I'd like to confirm the `owner` context for the *REVOC_REG_DEF*
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:57:33 GMT):<br/>
Agreed.  That's why I'd like to confirm the `owner` context for the *REVOC_REG_DEF*.  To confirm `"need_to_be_owner": true` on a *REVOC_REG_DEF* means you need to be the owner of the associated *CRED_DEF*.
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:59:42 GMT):<br/>
I think I was wrong when I said "I am pretty certain that "owner" always refers to the original signer of the TXN."  I believe that the "owner" is actually the txn author, or writer of the txn (not the signer or endorser, unless the endorser is also the author).
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 20:02:33 GMT):<br/>
If the above is true, `"need_to_be_owner": true` on a *REVOC_REG_DEF* means you need to be the owner of the associated *CRED_DEF*, then we can adjust the rules on ADD/EDIT for  *REVOC_REG_DEF* and *REVOC_REG_ENTRY* so they make sense for the real world use cases we're working though right now.
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 20:03:29 GMT):<br/>
Sorry, but I don't know for sure on the RegDef "ownership" question.  In all of the ownership cases that I have tested "owner" means writer of the txn, not "writer of some other assoctiated txn"
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 20:04:59 GMT):<br/>
Example: *REVOC_REG_ENTRY*, owner means the owner of the DID used to create the corresponding *REVOC_REG_DEF*.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 20:04:59 GMT):<br/>
Example: *REVOC_REG_ENTRY* txns, owner means the owner of the DID used to create the corresponding *REVOC_REG_DEF*.
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Mon, 10 Aug 2020 20:07:25 GMT):<br/>
You could test on builderNet by adding a new credDef as an Endorser, then attempting to add a new RegDef for it as a Trustee.  Trustees can create RegDef's on BuilderNet but "owner:true" is set appropriately...

I think I found the code, and it does not look like the validation for the *REVOC_REG_DEF* (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/indy_node/server/request_handlers/domain_req_handlers/revoc_reg_def_handler.py#L43) validates an owner (for the *CRED_DEF*) like the validation for the *REVOC_REG_ENTRY* (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/indy_node/server/request_handlers/domain_req_handlers/revoc_reg_entry_handler.py#L31) does (for the *REVOC_REG_DEF*).

Sorry Wade, my bad I've mixed the Von network with another sample. It started, however I have an "Error initializing pool ledger" in the interface (as a result of the "status" call), even if it seems that all the nodes seems to be running well
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 11 Aug 2020 14:35:06 GMT):<br/>
Try resetting things:
`./manage down`
wait for command to complete
`./manage start`
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 11 Aug 2020 14:36:00 GMT):<br/>
That error is typically a startup timing issue with the ledger browser connecting to the nodes.

Just a reminder about the Identity Implementer's WG Call tomorrow morning (Aug 13th @ 9am MT). This is a chance to get updates on the WG calls you may have missed this week.

Our guest presenter will be Sam Smith of ProSapien.  Sam will be presenting an overview of the new KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) methodology.  KERI creates a self-certifying identifier that provides the basis for a universal DID method (DID:uni).

Here are links to the Wiki and the Zoom meeting.

In talking with the Indy team some time ago I was told that "the sweet point" for the size of a production Indy ledger was 25 nodes --- large enough to be resilient (allowing up to 8 node failures), but small enough to have reasonable consensus performance.  I was asked about whether there is documentation about the testing done to come up with that metric and I don't have any.  @esplinr -- do you know of such information?  Anyone else?

Thanks

<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Mon, 17 Aug 2020 14:48:09 GMT):<br/>

Hello, Does each validator holds a separate node in Indy?
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 19:51:31 GMT):<br/>
Yes, if I understand your question correctly. In Indy we regularly use the terms "Validator" and "Node" to mean the same thing.
</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 19:54:16 GMT):<br/>
okay, what i mean to ask is how many minimum and maximum validators can be there in any indy network? and does each validator need to assign a separate node in system?
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 19:59:02 GMT):<br/>
Minimum is 4, maximum is unknown, but we recommend maxing out at 25 validator nodes because after that there is a significant performance reduction.
Yes, each Validator is a single node in our system (a separate server is required for each Validator Node in Sovrin's networks, for example)
</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 20:00:22 GMT):<br/>
thanks @lynn.bendixsen  for the reply..
</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 20:02:20 GMT):<br/>
@lynn.bendixsen could you also please confirm that is it mandatory that Each holder and Issuer also holds a separate node?
</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 20:03:09 GMT):<br/>
i mean who all parties in any Indy network should be assign a node?
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 20:11:56 GMT):<br/>
I am not sure what you mean by 'holder' and 'issuer' in this context. Perhaps you are using the terms differently?  In "Indy/Aries" terminology an "Issuer" and a "Holder" are terms used in delivering and having credentials, and there are an indeterminately large number of those that can exist on each Indy Network, regardless of how many nodes are in the network.  
In the Sovrin Indy Networks, there are Stewards who have volunteered to run the nodes (based on their governance documents).  Each Steward is only allowed to run one Node.  In a theoretical generic Indy network, this boils down to "each STEWARD DID on the ledger can only instantiate one Indy node".
</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 20:16:26 GMT):<br/>
thanks for the insights @lynn.bendixsen , so if i ask in general that how many nodes other than validators as you mentioned above is required to form a indy network? i mean i am just curios to know in perspective of a network setup
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 20:18:49 GMT):<br/>
None, there are currently no Indy nodes that are not validator nodes in an Indy Network.

Hi, could anyone tell me the difference between full length verkeys and abbreviated verkeys? Why would I want to use one over the other? Looking at the indy code whether an abbreviated verkey is used is dependant on the `cid` parameter. What does `cid` mean? I tried to find it somewhere in the docs, code, etc.. but no luck.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 21:25:56 GMT):<br/>
The verkey is 32 bytes, and by default in Indy the DID is chosen as the first 16 bytes of that key, before base58 encoding. The abbreviated verkey just replaces the first 16 bytes with ~ when it matches the DID.
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 22:03:06 GMT):<br/>
I am not an expert, but because I was curious... 
Everything I see when googling "cid hyperledger indy" seems to indicate the following: 
1. cid means cryptonym ID
2. cid is deprecated
3. the cid parameter you refer to indicates the length of the DID/CID and not the length of the verkey. (or at least it used to, https://docs.rs/crate/indy/0.1.1-70/source/src/api/signus.rs)
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 22:34:40 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @andrew.whitehead and @lynn.bendixsen . That makes sense. I now see the `cid` indeed indicates the length of the did, not the verkey.

The expected model is that the there would be a revocation of the current credential and a reissue of a new one.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 23:28:49 GMT):<br/>
Just to be very clear in this conversation -- if your are talking about a issuer and verifier in the Verifiable Credentials sense of the terms, neither of them needs run a node on the Indy Network.  An issuer needs to be able to write certain transactions to the ledger and so needs permission to do that, and a verifier just needs to read from the network and that is public.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 23:30:39 GMT):<br/>
There is no "issuer" in the context of an Indy network node and the term "validator" is used to mean that the nodes validate what gets written to the ledger.  All of that is well below the layer dealing with verifiable credentials.

Hello again! I was wondering how and where is the wallet object stored? Locally? The walkthrough and examples make it look like a serializable object. So my guess would be to store it in a cryptographically secure file in the user's machine, or file storage.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 20 Aug 2020 15:33:02 GMT):<br/>
Yes.  It's stored in a database which can be local or on another server.  The database is pluggable and there are SQLite and Postgres plugins available.
</p>
<p><strong>Lucampelli</strong> (Thu, 20 Aug 2020 18:08:21 GMT):<br/>
Nice! Could you point me out to one of the plugins? Would python-mysqlconnector work?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 20 Aug 2020 18:40:08 GMT):<br/>
Postgres plug in is here.  It's in the samples for historical reasons.  It's in production in many places.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 20 Aug 2020 18:42:16 GMT):<br/>
Postgres is here.  It's in experimental for historical reasons -- it's been in production for a long time.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 20 Aug 2020 18:43:07 GMT):<br/>
MySQL could be done, but it's non-trivial to create a plugin.  Not too much work, but more than just a config.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 20 Aug 2020 18:44:38 GMT):<br/>
What is your interest.  We are currently working on Aries Storage as the next generation of what is the Indy Wallet.  Based on some of the concepts in Indy Wallet, but adjusted based on learnings from using Indy Wallet and new non-Indy requirements.

There are none.  Indy is designed for identity -- DIDs and objects related to Verifiable Credentials. It is not used for asset transfer or other general purpose applications.
</p>
<p><strong>MarinaELias</strong> (Mon, 24 Aug 2020 14:25:15 GMT):<br/>
Hi all,
I am currently working on a project but I am confused in some concepts.
First, where is the wallet that stores the credentials saved? Is it saved on a blockchain or just a local database?
Secondly, I still don't get how the verifier entity verifies the correctness of the presented values? From what I understood, the personal data of the student or the holder of a transcript are not saved on the ledger, so what does the verifier compare against the ledger if the data is not there?
I would appreciate your help, thank you in advance.
</p>
<p><strong>jameshiester</strong> (Mon, 24 Aug 2020 16:11:18 GMT):<br/>
The wallet, including credentials, are stored in database.  This can either be the default local database (I believe it's rocksDB or sqlite), or use a storage plugin such as the postgresql plugin, which would store the wallet in any postgres database (which can be either local or in the cloud).  With respect to verifying the "correctness" of the presented values, it is more correct to say that the verifier is verifying the source of the presented values, which is the authority that issued the credential.  The issuer authority has a public verkey that is published to the ledger, along with a key associated with the credential definition.  These keys are used to "sign" the credential.  When generating this signature, the private keys associated with the authority issuer and credential definition are used, as well as the actual value of the credential.  This ensures that only the issuer authority can generate a valid signature, and the properties of the credential cannot be modified without invalidating the signature.  Therefore, by validating the signature, the verifier is confirming the source and veracity of the credential data.
</p>
<p><strong>jameshiester</strong> (Mon, 24 Aug 2020 16:13:13 GMT):<br/>
Note: I'm not 100% certain that's accurate about the private key of the credential definition, but I am confident about the general gist of the signature and it's use
</p>
<p><strong>MarinaELias</strong> (Mon, 24 Aug 2020 16:19:26 GMT):<br/>
Thank you so much for your reply!
I understand now, but my last question is from where does the verifier get the signature on the credential, is it send with the data that is presented to the verifier from the chosen credential?

<p><strong>jameshiester</strong> (Mon, 24 Aug 2020 16:22:32 GMT):<br/>
yes, credentials are not send directly from the holder to the verifier, but rather as part of a presentation that the holder creates.  This presentation includes the values (if the holder chooses to reveal them), and the signatures.  This allows the holder to use multiple credentials in a single proof, as well as the ability to use zero-knowledge proofs (e.g. proving they are over 18 without including their actual birthdate in the proof).

Okay so in the end what proves the correctness of the credential is its digital signature. So what is the role of the blockchain besides storing the public keys of each entity, as the public keys could be stored anywhere else without the need for a blockchain. What am I missing?

<p><strong>jameshiester</strong> (Mon, 24 Aug 2020 17:01:35 GMT):<br/>
The blockchain acts as a decentralized authority for the keys, schemas, and revocation registries.  While alternative systems are also feasible, the ledger provides an excellent way to achieve consensus around what format those keys and schemas should be published in, and a consistent and fault tolerant way of reading them.  Additionally, the blockchain creates an immutable record, so it is easy to audit the entire trail of a schema or key back to who created it, and even who onboarded that identity and all the ancestor identities going back to the original genesis transaction.  In short, it's a good way of allowing peer-to-peer credential sharing, while still creating an anchor of trust.

Hi again,
I am sorry but there is something I still don't get, how does the Proof verify that the claims were issued to the presenter?
What makes it impossible for someone to steal the student's identity?
</p>
<p><strong>jameshiester</strong> (Tue, 25 Aug 2020 12:19:06 GMT):<br/>
The answer lies in a secret passwed between the student and original issuer.  The holder (student) provides the issuer a blinded link secret that is inserted into the credential before it is issued. To prove the credential, the holder must prove (in zero knowledge) that they possess the link secret to unblind the the blinded link secret. That proves that the entity that constructed the proof was the one to which the credential was issued. When there are multiple credentials sourced into a single proof, all must use the same link secret.  That being said, no digital system is 100% effective in preventing identity theft.  The secret is still stored in the users wallet, so if an attacker is able to get access to the wallet and decrypt it, they would be able to steal the student's identity.  This is why wallets need to be protected with strong authentication, which very likely includes biometrics

Indy does not use ZK-SNARK. I believe that Ursa has some support, but that Indy does not use them.  Better asked on the Ursa channel.
</p>
<p><strong>thearhaam</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 04:48:46 GMT):<br/>
Hey :D so I was going through this repo: https://github.com/cloudcompass/ToIPLabs/tree/master/src/indy-material/nodejs the README mentions "This folder contains a demonstration of basic Hyperledger Indy and Aries Agents, which are built on the Ursa project." However the code is the same as the old indy alice demo. Is there another repo that I can look into instead?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 13:41:02 GMT):<br/>
The ACA-Py contains a far more advanced version that continues to evolve.  Check it out - https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python
</p>
<p><strong>thearhaam</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 17:37:47 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran Thank you, I've gone through the ACA-Py demo already. Currently I'm exploring Indy & Aries but will be looking into Ursa as well so wanted to know if there was an example or demo with Indy, Aries and Ursa all working together.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 17:51:27 GMT):<br/>
Indy is dependent on Ursa (includes Ursa components in the build). ACA-Py's support for Indy by embedding the Indy SDK. That's how Ursa gets into Indy and Aries.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 17:51:48 GMT):<br/>
So whenever you use ACA-Py, you are using Ursa.

I want to make sure the Indy community is aware of this conversation happening in the W3C, in which it has been proposed to eliminate serviceEndpoint from the DID core spec. This would be disruptive to DIDComm. It appears that the proposal has been rejected (DIDComm is safe), but there are still some voices claiming that serviceEndpoint is useless nonsense.

Hello Team,
For Indy-Aries-ursa setup which Ubuntu version is recommended?
</p>
<p><strong>Xand</strong> (Wed, 02 Sep 2020 10:55:09 GMT):<br/>
@SamB I think it's 16.04 support atm: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node

Is there a convention for storing the routing key in Indy for a Public DID? I can store it with an attrib txn but I wonder if there's a key that's used conventionally. Like 'endpoint' is for ServiceEndpoint

<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Tue, 08 Sep 2020 12:36:01 GMT):<br/>
For now there is no convention used for routing keys in an ATTRIB.  We have the same concern and have settled on using 'routingkeys'.  However, out of the Indy Interop-athon the decision was made to use an ATTRIB transaction to store full DIDDocs for DIDs.  That work will be ongoing over the next couple of months I imagine.  More information can be found here:  https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/II/Agenda.  In the meantime, if you are thinking of using a custom ATTRIB for the routing keys it might make sense to just go ahead and store the entire DIDDoc in a custom ATTRIB and prepare yourself for the future changes.

It seems that "apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys CE7709D068DB5E88" is at a fault. The repository seems to be missing.

Yes for diversity it is actually best if different nodes are in different clouds. Each node has a copy of the ledger that it uses to maintain consensus, but there is just one "ledger" per network. 
"How can we achieve the same?" I don't think I understand the questions, but to set up individual nodes in separate clouds to build a brand new network you could use this to get started https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XE2QOiGWuRzWdlxiI9LrG9Am9dCfPXBXnv52wGHorNE

I am concerned about the ramifications for DIDComm of this DID core issue: https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/386
Joe A suggests that our (DIDComm designers) interpretation of the DID spec with regard to key rotation has no basis in the spec language. He may or may not be right, but I’m pretty confident that neither does the other interpretation he points out. I consider that other interpretation, where you can’t look up any DID state except the current one, to be totally unacceptable, to the point where I think we would have to abandon support for DIDs if key rotation is not supported. This is a BIG deal. Please be proactive about reading this ticket, commenting, and mustering support for our interpretation among like-minded community members.

Hello! I have a doubt about schema and credential definitions in the walkthroughs. I'm creating my own example to learn about the different flows. Is schema definition and cred_def issuance only allowed by the stewart trust anchor? I've sent requests for "TRUST ANCHOR" verinyms by the stewart, but these did's return unauthorized when sending schema definitions... am I doing something wrong?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 15 Sep 2020 18:11:13 GMT):<br/>
No.  Indy has a flexible authorization system for writes to the ledger.  It's configurable, and in the Sovrin system (for example), there are 6 explicit roles:

- readers -- anyone
- author -- anyone with a DID on the ledger
- network monitor -- has a DID and can query nodes to get detailed status about them
- endorser -- has a DID and is permitted to sign transactions from authors and endorsers (including themselves) such that they can be written to the ledger. The endorser pays for all transactions that they sign and are written.
- steward -- can operate a node on the ledger and contribute to validation
- trustee -- can do what an endorser can do and can sign transactions to write endorser DIDs.

So the TRUST ANCHOR is an Endorser on Sovrin, and so can sign and write it's on transactions, but a "normal" DID, cannot.  In the sandbox environment, there is a TRUSTEE that you can create the DID for -- the seed for the DID is available for all.
</p>
<p><strong>Lucampelli</strong> (Tue, 15 Sep 2020 18:20:44 GMT):<br/>
Also, the indy_node pool from /docker/pool_start.sh is giving an error called CommonInvalidState

This is a great opportunity for anyone wanting to get involved in Indy development to pick up some tasks to contribute with support from existing contributors.  We'll also be using this release to migrate the indy-node release process to GitHub Actions.

<p><strong>Lucampelli</strong> (Tue, 15 Sep 2020 18:24:12 GMT):<br/>
So even if stewart sends verinyms for an user for example, if the role is TRUST_ANCHOR the user can't create schemas, nor sign it's transactions, but if it's a TRUSTEE, it can?
</p>
<p><strong>Lucampelli</strong> (Tue, 15 Sep 2020 18:36:42 GMT):<br/>
Ok... so for some context, my code creates the stewart's wallet, then creates a regulatory agent, RA. Creates it's wallet, and stewart (maybe the gov) sends a verynim to the ledger appointing RA as Trust_anchor. RA then creates a schema (that's working) and now wants to create a cred_def based on it's schema, but i'm getting indy.error.CommonInvalidStructure.

<p><strong>Lucampelli</strong> (Wed, 16 Sep 2020 14:05:36 GMT):<br/>
Ok.. solved one issue. The cred_def problem happened because i used the id instead of the json... didn't notice it. Now this is the problem: 
{'identifier': '5mhbTjB662MT599k6dpB4P',
 'op': 'REQNACK',
 'reason': "client request invalid: InvalidClientRequest('validation error "
           '[ClientClaimDefSubmitOperation]: cannot be smaller than 1 '
           "(ref=0)',)",
 'reqId': 1600265018440896430}
i'm using only the "user" credentials, like did and wallet, not the stewart, since i made the "user" a trust_anchor... any leads?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 16 Sep 2020 14:08:46 GMT):<br/>
It's crypto magic, but here is a quick summary.  At issue time, the holder uses their link secret to create a piece of "blinded" data that they give to the issuer, who in turn puts it in the credential.

At proving time, the holder uses their link secret to "unblind" that data. That proves to the verifier that the holder has the link secret that was used to blind the data that went into the credential.  Further, that unblinded data is given to the verifier such that it is different in every proof, and does not create a unique identifier for the credential (Privacy preserving).

That's at a high level -- you would have to go to the crypto level to understand more.

Wikipedia of Commitment Schemes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme) will give you more on the data that the holder gives to the issuer to be put in the credential and later proven.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 16 Sep 2020 14:23:45 GMT):<br/>
On the TRUST_ANCHOR question -- I believe that is the generic Indy term for Endorser that is used in my definition above.

Hi everyone, I have a question about Indy's api calls about proof creation and verification. In order to prove that multiple credentials have the same attribute value without disclosing the attribute, "add_common_attribute" funtion of Ursa may be used. However, as far as I know, there is no way to add such functionality or trigger to call function "add_common_attribute" from Indy's api calls. Am I wrong?

* https://privatebin.net/?5149379525afb412#7NZkjBow4frdUZvkGeZNcYtsLwdcmcpgJXSfiaeHPN5C (Pool Timeout)

Do I maybe need to alter the dummy agent's sample config somehow?

No restrictions -- that's been a common case.  We hope people will use shared schema over time -- easier for verifiers, but not required.

1. Does  Master KEY used to get generated at the time of starting the agent itself in the backend process by indy?
</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Fri, 18 Sep 2020 09:24:12 GMT):<br/>
2. Does the master key & master secret key are two different things here ? and  does every actor knows the holder's master secret key at the time of verification?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 18 Sep 2020 15:00:46 GMT):<br/>
The terminology is not precise.  Master Secret is what is used in credential exchange.  Master Key I think in this context is the wallet key -- the key for encrypting/decrypting items in the wallet/storage.

Both are known only to the Holder/Prover. The Master Secret (aka Link Secret) is used to prove the Prover created the value that was put into the issued credential.
</p>
<p><strong>AryamaI</strong> (Fri, 18 Sep 2020 15:08:06 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran  please confirm so at the start of agent only master key is als generated? no way for a user to see rehat his wallet maste key is?
</p>
<p><strong>AryamaI</strong> (Fri, 18 Sep 2020 15:08:06 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran  please confirm so at the start of agent only master key is also generated? no way for a user to see what his wallet master key is?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 18 Sep 2020 17:58:41 GMT):<br/>
I think that is the case, but I'll ping @andrew.whitehead  to confirm.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 18 Sep 2020 18:06:55 GMT):<br/>
The master key can refer to a couple things. You can use a wallet password, in which case it derives a wallet encryption key using argon2 each time you open it. You can also configure the wallet with a raw 32-byte key and bypass the key derivation.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 18 Sep 2020 18:09:20 GMT):<br/>
Actually I don't think aca-py exposes a way for you to use a raw key, that's only at the lower level. But the encryption key is derived directly from the wallet password
</p>
<p><strong>AryamaI</strong> (Sat, 19 Sep 2020 03:15:17 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for the explanations  @swcurran and @andrew.whitehead 
</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Sat, 19 Sep 2020 07:30:26 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @andrew.whitehead so does is mean that master secret key is also getting generated internally in the process and as developer we don't have to do anything extra here?

Heads up @sheru and @SuperSeiyan 
We in Absa have forked LibVCX and took the development off hyperledger https://github.com/AbsaOSS/libvcx

So you might want to consider using this, as far as I know Evernym is not intending further development of libvcx development in hyperledger. Absa has been main contributor to LibVCX for a while before we decided to fork.

<p><strong>sheru</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 12:35:12 GMT):<br/>
once the nodes running in the local machine most probably you will get see the services on port 9000. you can found the genesis info in localhost:9000/genesis , use this path and run the aca-py agent and pass the genesis url in the envs of the docker.
</p>
<p><strong>AryamaI</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 12:45:04 GMT):<br/>
Hi @sheru , the ports exposed are from 9701-9708. Even so. I cant see the genesis info in any of these ports when trying to open from browser
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 18:52:36 GMT):<br/>
The port 9000 web service is a feature of von-network, so you don't get that with plain indy.  You need to get a genesis file for the configuration you have -- with the correct IP addresses and ports.  I think (but am not certain) that is available in folder where the nodes are running.  I would think the Indy docs for starting up a raw network would cover from where to get the genesis file.

Once you have that, you need to copy it somewhere that the ACA-Py agent can get to it and use the mechanism to use GENESIS_FILE with the path to the file.

You don't need the genesis files to start the nodes, but you need it to start the instances of ACA-Py that you are running.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 16:06:08 GMT):<br/>
The error you are getting is that the IP address is probably wrong.  You need to determine the IP address of the nodes (their public IP) and edit the genesis file to put those in.

Thank you @swcurran . Can you confirm going forward to build indy application at the production level. Is it recommended to use mainnet or proceed with our own indy node vanilla setup

On the mailing list for Indy, there was a proposal to move Absa LibVCX under the Hyperledger umbrella, and possibly to remove the libvcx folder that currently sits under Indy SDK. How can we make a formal decision on the proposal? Should we put it to a vote on a community cal, or vote on it here, or something else?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 18:32:17 GMT):<br/>
I personally would not use an internal indy node network for a production app.  A key component of decentralized identity is that the keys are publicly available and not controlled by one entity. Sovrin governs the mainnet, but the nodes are operated by many different organizations.
</p>
<p><strong>AryamaI</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 18:39:37 GMT):<br/>
Ok thank you @swcurran for the input
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 25 Sep 2020 23:18:49 GMT):<br/>
I should have said in the above: "... and *the publication of the keys is* not controlled by one entity"

I am trying to get indy-node to run locally following the "Dev Setup" guide: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/setup-dev.md
When finally running "pytest ." in the indy-node directory, it fails with "ImportError: No module named '_lzma'".
This seems (after a quick google search) to indicate a problem with the python environment.

1) The guide is aimed at Ubuntu 16.04, while I am running on Linux Mint 19.3. May this be the cause of the error, and if so, how can I get it to work?


In the bigger picture, I'm trying to get a better understanding of the communication between the Indy pool and clients. I've found out so far that it uses ZeroMQ, and as a next step I wanted to get indy-node to run locally and add debug output to print out all ZeroMQ messages that are being sent and received.

2) Are there some useful resources in the documentation that cover the topic of which messages are being sent/received via ZeroMQ?

It may be better to start by understanding the intercommunication from a higher level first.  That will also provide you with a better idea of the components and infrastructure involved.  A good place to start is https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/master/DevReadMe.md

Hello @esplinr , thanks for sharing the link above, I have checked it and see the transactions are for schema, credenital_defs. Can you tell me if I want to store not these standard indy data but rather ike store lets say some transaction done outside of indy, but store that transaction info on indy ledger like a financial transaction or something like that as an immutable record onto the ledger. Trying to understand if we can use indy ledger for more features than idenity

</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 13:22:49 GMT):<br/>
Indy is an identity specific ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 13:22:58 GMT):<br/>
So you would have to model the data as an existing Indy transaction.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 13:24:26 GMT):<br/>
Another approach is to creating a ledger plugin for your needs. This is a good example:
https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/token-plugin
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 13:25:05 GMT):<br/>
Or you can use indy-plenum as a general purpose block-chain without the indy-node transactions.

https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 13:27:09 GMT):<br/>
I would like to hear more about your "financial transaction data" use case. There are a few groups working on similar problems:

https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/pull/160
</p>
<p><strong>AryamaI</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 13:30:25 GMT):<br/>
@esplinr when you say model data as indy transaction that means either make a create schema, create credential definition transactions something like this rt . But I can't do a custom transaction?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 13:31:03 GMT):<br/>
Correct. Indy excludes custom transactions to discourage people putting random junk on the ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>AryamaI</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 13:35:41 GMT):<br/>
@esplinr  The problem statement which we are looking into is a transaction done between two peers in a network, where before making the transaction the peers are both validated using indy identity. Once validated transaction happens and then store the transaction info onto the blockchain indy ledger if possible
</p>
<p><strong>AryamaI</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 13:35:41 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 13:38:26 GMT):<br/>
The identity information isn't stored on Indy. The credential is defined on Indy, and the identity information is transmitted peer-to-peer. This preserves individual privacy. It also makes it easy to use those credentials as part of any workflow, such as validating participants to transactions on a separate DLT network.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 13:38:55 GMT):<br/>
But if you really wanted to store additional information on Indy, then the best approach would be to write a ledger plugin.

<p><strong>AryamaI</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 13:48:41 GMT):<br/>
@esplinr can you confirm if on the indy test/mainnet this new transaction type(plugin) functionality we can implement.  
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 13:50:43 GMT):<br/>
There is no Indy Test / MainNet.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 13:50:54 GMT):<br/>
Do you mean the Sovrin StagingNet / MainNet?
</p>
<p><strong>AryamaI</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 13:51:02 GMT):<br/>
Yes 
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 13:51:02 GMT):<br/>
You would have to propose the usage of your plugin, and get enough stewards to accept it.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 13:51:30 GMT):<br/>
The Sovrin network is designed to not allow non-identity transactions. Stewards don't want to be responsible for that data.
</p>
<p><strong>AryamaI</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 13:52:43 GMT):<br/>
Ok. If this functionality we want to incorporate then we can do it in our own network ledger rt as per the documentation?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 13:53:49 GMT):<br/>
It is possible, but might not be the preferred approach. In general, I would favor managing the data separate from the identity stuff.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 13:54:10 GMT):<br/>
You need to be careful to avoid correlation that undermines privacy.
</p>
<p><strong>AryamaI</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 13:55:24 GMT):<br/>
Ok. Thank you for the insights and suggestions @esplinr

I am trying to submit write transactions to Sovrin buildnet and for that I need to provide the TAA.  For that I need the acceptance mechanism.  When I attempt to read the mechanism list (TXN #7) I am getting no results.  I'm using indy_vdr for these transactions.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!
</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 21:52:35 GMT):<br/>
Being the impatient guy that I am I kept poking at this.  At first I found the following article https://sovrin.org/preparing-for-the-sovrin-transaction-author-agreement/ and assumed that maybe the mechanism could be _anything_.  So I passed something and got an error.  And happily I found in the error message the following:  `"Txn Author Agreement acceptance mechanism is inappropriate: provided session_instantiation, expected one of ['at_submission', 'click_agreement', 'for_session', 'on_file', 'product_eula', 'service_agreement', 'wallet_agreement']`.  I now know the acceptable values.

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 00:52:18 GMT):<br/>
Are you looking on the right ledger? The TAA and AML transactions are on the config ledger, aka. subledger 2
</p>
<p><strong>pfeairheller</strong> (Wed, 30 Sep 2020 00:56:55 GMT):<br/>
Running the same request for TAA and AML.  And the TAA works.  I'll check in the morning to be sure.

Using the indy-cli works to get the AML using `ledger get-acceptance-mechanisms` so you might be able to find example code in the indy-sdk/cli code to help. Start here maybe? https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/cli/src/commands/ledger.rs

Thanks for the heads up! Now one more question appeared, how to decentralize it? I mean run it in more than one server? I know that in order to connect to it from outside all I need is the genesis.txn file from it, and the client will connect on it's own. But what would happen if I, let's say have two servers, A and B. Ran the docker on A, creating the genesisA.txn file, transfered the file to B, and used it as the genesis file for creating the pool in B. What would happen?
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 02 Oct 2020 15:44:20 GMT):<br/>
The genesis file should contain the information for all the initial pool nodes.

Hi everyone. I'm new here. I'm a recent graduated and I attend the last year of the master’s degree in Telecommunications and Informatics Engineering. I’m currently developing my dissertation with the theme "evaluation of blockchain technology in Identity Management context in Mobility as a Service".

Hi Folks! I wanted to have a comparative differentiation between hyperledger indy vs Uport of Consensys vs Metadium, I have asked this question on the sovrin forum https://forum.sovrin.org/t/metadium-vs-sovrin/1496  here is the link and I still don't have answers. Indy and Metadium support multiple dids whereas uport supports only single did right?
</p>
<p><strong>vasantkk</strong> (Tue, 06 Oct 2020 13:23:34 GMT):<br/>
There are dozens of identity-related blockchain projects out there, and everytime we hear of a new blockchain-ID project we roll our eyes thinking, “another one?!” Civic, SelfKey, Metadium, Blockpass, VeriME, uPort, Sovrin, UniquID, BlockAuth, and the list goes on and on. How to differentiate from all these projects?

:point_up_2:  I second @vasantkk question
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Wed, 07 Oct 2020 02:56:47 GMT):<br/>
I believe the idea is that by allowing multiple DIDs and DID methods wallets and agents aren't necessarily tied to infrastructure or particular implementations
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Wed, 07 Oct 2020 02:57:53 GMT):<br/>
that's just my beginner's understanding though.  Other people should be more able to compare actual features and spec implementations of all these systems.  You might try the W3C identity WG.  I think they were discussing this on one of their mailing lists or chats
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Wed, 07 Oct 2020 03:34:51 GMT):<br/>
I’m not really sure what it means for a ledger to only allow one DID. In the case of Indy/Aries it’s encouraged to use single-purpose DIDs for communication between agents, which ought to be possible no matter what the backing identity ledger is. As for a comparison between the different ledgers, I’m not aware of one, but I’m sure it would be welcome.

what is the difference between indy vs ethereum
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Wed, 07 Oct 2020 13:07:34 GMT):<br/>
They are two completely different types of ledgers.

what makes erc725 different from indy?
</p>
<p><strong>vasantkk</strong> (Wed, 07 Oct 2020 13:10:05 GMT):<br/>
or SSI as a concept?
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Wed, 07 Oct 2020 13:16:53 GMT):<br/>
erc725 is a set of identity standards for working on etherum.  Indy is a ledger technology meant to work with W3C VC as implemented with DIDs.  SSI is a broad concept that covers lots of different forms of decentralized identity systems and how to go about making those systems useable on the Internet.
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Wed, 07 Oct 2020 13:17:15 GMT):<br/>
but like I said, the W3C Identity WG I think has a document or something you can ask about with an FAQ on all these things (or should)
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Wed, 07 Oct 2020 13:17:50 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Wed, 07 Oct 2020 13:31:54 GMT):<br/>

Just a reminder about the Identity Implementer's WG Call tomorrow morning (Oct 8th @ 9am MT).  In this call, we review updates from a variety of industry WGs that you may have missed this week.

For our discussion this week, I am planning to describe some cryptographic primitives and then we can all discuss if / how they might be of use to identity.

Here are links to the Wiki and the Zoom meeting.

How does sovrin ensure that the Issuer is not fake and not giving out fake certificates?
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 13:42:43 GMT):<br/>
@vasantkk If the issuer is not trusted in the ecosystem then people will not accept its certificates.  If the issuer is attempting to impersonate another issuer (like a fake US gov't issuer issuing passports) then they will likely not hold the right keys that the US gov't signs in its issuing documents (or delegates)

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 18:16:45 GMT):<br/>
@daidoji has it right.  Anyone can issue credentials to holders, and holders can present them to verifiers.  That allows the verifier to trust what they get from the holder -- they can't be tampered with, are bound to the holder and the issuer is known.

What the verifier has to decide if they trust the issuer.  They may know the issuer because they only accepted credentials from certain issuers, or they have to somehow (there are techniques) for deciding if the issuer can be trusted.  This the human trust side of VCs. 

As noted, an issuer can pretend to be another issuer without taking control of the identifier (and associated keys) used to issue the credential.

is indy a blockchain/ledger or a did standard a bit confused from this article https://medium.com/linum-labs/the-whos-who-of-decentralized-identity-systems-433b2dd9a195
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 12:56:09 GMT):<br/>
Indy is an open source ledger focused on identity, and in particular, verifiable credentials.  You can run an instance of Indy to operate a ledger, such as the ones operated by sovrin.org.  It is a "generic" blockchain underneath (plenum RBFT). with a transaction interface (indy-node) that limits the types of transactions to those specifically related to identity and verifiable credential use cases.  Entities (people, organizations, things) run agents that communicate with the ledger to read and write data.  It is public (anyone can read) permissioned (nodes of the network are permissioned to join consensus).
</p>
<p><strong>vasantkk</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 13:18:56 GMT):<br/>
is civic wallet open source cause  I see this https://www.identity.com/
</p>
<p><strong>vasantkk</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 13:51:33 GMT):<br/>
for private key recovery does indy use shamir secret key sharing for recovery?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 17:41:38 GMT):<br/>
The current indy-sdk has a storage component ("indy-wallet") that supports exporting an encrypted version of wallet data with a key.  What you do with that is up to you, so it would be a higher level component that would implement the storage of the export and how to handle the key for recovery.  So recovery strategies are at a layer up from Indy.

<p><strong>lijiachuan</strong> (Sat, 10 Oct 2020 11:09:06 GMT):<br/>
hi @swcurran , I would like to have your suggestion about another scenario of sharing digital identity, for example, to be able to use one service provided from one service provider, user needs to provide some identities  such as name, email or even bank information, we know that this needs to be shared securely with user's consent, and when user doesn't want to share this any more, he/she can revoke this consent. Is there any recommended approach to implement this? Traditionally this information is shared and stored in service provider's database, am not sure whether there is any other better way. Kindly advise. Thanks.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 12 Oct 2020 08:24:16 GMT):<br/>
There is nothing inherent in SSI for the use case you are defining. The user has been issued some credentials. A verifier asks the user for proof of those credentials via a proof request. The user (holder/prover) decides to construct provide and send the proof. At that point, the verifier has received the data and can do with it what they want -- there is nothing in the technology to prevent that, and there is nothing the holder/prover can do to "revoke" having given over the information.

Think of the same scenario with paper credentials -- showing your driver's licence.  You can't go back later and say "Forget that I showed you my licence".

Where this goes is the governance framework under which the participants are operating (if any). Under what conditions (e.g. GDPR, etc.) was the proof requested, and the proof sent.

Finally -- to be clear, an issuer of a credential can often revoke the credential to prevent the holder/prover from being able to continue to prove the credential they were issued.

Hi all: Currently I am on a project which brings together your project on the hyperledger Indy platform, my question which is the mobile agent that you used to develop the holder part. My question is precisely what type of mobile agent I can use and which is functional Aries MAX (Aries Mobile Agent Xamarin) - Xamarin / .Net, Aries React-Native Mobile Agent (ARNIMA) - React Native or React Native Indy SDK (rn-indy-sdk) - React Native.
Thanks in advance for your help

Hi everyone! I've a few questions around DKMS (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0051-dkms/dkms-v4.md). The document mentions an "Agent Policy Registry" for multi-device management. Is that implemented on Indy? Also, does libindy provide any recovery mechanisms? In particular, I'm more interested in social key recovery using Shamir Secret Sharing.

I think I also read some discussion about key rotation the other day but I'd like to know if my understanding's correct - Does Indy only support resolving the latest key for a DID every time? Is there a way to resolve the key at timestamp=x? I don't think indy-vdr exposes any such API (yet?). I'm curious to know if that's a limitation of the current design or it is by design? @danielhardman @andrewwhi

Ok, got it, so actually indy should only be used for this type of credential issuance, request and verify, but how the data will be used after verify is out of the scope but needs to be defined by another approach/framework.

@MathewJoseph Which version of RN are you using? This is a problem with react-native > 0.61.5 currently. We're having the same problem with aries-framework-javascript. See https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/29930 and https://github.com/react-native-community/upgrade-support/issues/114 . So assuming you're on RN > 0.61.5 for now the "fix" will be to downgrade to version 0.61.5
</p>
<p><strong>MathewJoseph</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 11:03:09 GMT):<br/>
@TimoGlastra I am using RN 0.63.2 for my project. Oh now it all makes sense i had a sample project of 0.61.5 and open pool was working fine in it but when i integrated it to the main app it started crashing even though everything was same.

Most performance test results are captured in the tickets linked to 
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1343
Such as 
https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1717

Then we largely rolled it into our regular testing process with video discussions:

We haven't done as much performance testing in 2020, as the pace of development has slowed.

Hi All,

I want to share with you this medium tutorial (https://medium.com/@khalifa.toumi/how-to-use-hyperledger-aries-cloud-agent-for-a-classical-workflow-issuer-holder-verifier-9dd595f2f847) that describes the different steps to have a simple workflow between a verifier, issuer and a holder.
Do not hesitate to comment it. I hope that it may help someone.

I recommending starting with Aries rather than Indy - Aries in an agent layer that sits on top of Indy and eventually will interoperate across other verifiable credential networks as well

Hi I am currently facing issues on Native iOS after installing pods and adding requisite files to the project, after following indy integration steps still it throws this error `error: module compiled with Swift 4.2.1 cannot be imported by the Swift 5.3 compiler /Users/IndySdk/ios/Pods/libindy-objc/libindy-objc/Indy.framework/Modules/Indy.swiftmodule/arm64.swiftmodule. `Libindy-objc` is not maintained frequently it seems. What can be done here, Can we expect a new release to avoid swift compiler error !?
</p>
<p><strong>gnarula</strong> (Tue, 27 Oct 2020 07:28:52 GMT):<br/>
yeah, I ran into the above as well. Unfortunately the only way around it for now is to build libindy-objc yourself using the xcode/swift you have locally to avoid version conflicts
</p>
<p><strong>pavanMude 1</strong> (Tue, 27 Oct 2020 08:05:12 GMT):<br/>
@gnarula Thanks for your response, Can you please elaborate, the procedure that you had followed while dealing with this issue and how did you overcome this error!? I appreciate your help here.
</p>
<p><strong>gnarula</strong> (Tue, 27 Oct 2020 08:20:35 GMT):<br/>
@pavanMude 1  Clone indy-sdk from https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk and cd into `wrappers/ios/libindy-pod`. Do a `pod install` there and then open the `Indy.xcworkspace` file using XCode. Build the `Indy` Project and then Archive it. View the archive in finder, right click, show archive-contents and then copy 'Indy.framework' from '/Products/Library/Frameworks' and import it to your iOS project
</p>
<p><strong>pavanMude 1</strong> (Tue, 27 Oct 2020 08:35:35 GMT):<br/>
@gnarula Thanks for your help, I will give a try then.
</p>
<p><strong>pavanMude 1</strong> (Tue, 27 Oct 2020 09:03:16 GMT):<br/>
@gnarula While installing pods from cloned `libindy-pod` project, it throws warning `[!] The Podfile contains framework or static library targets (Indy), for which the Podfile does not contain host targets (targets which embed the framework).` Do you have idea why it is happening !?

<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Tue, 27 Oct 2020 17:56:57 GMT):<br/>
this might be a silly question, but what will be the broad differences between `did:indy` and `did:sov`?
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Tue, 27 Oct 2020 17:58:23 GMT):<br/>
or what is the motivation for `did:indy`?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 27 Oct 2020 18:13:44 GMT):<br/>
The main motivation is that `did:indy` will have a component to identify the network instance on which to resolve the DID. That is missing from `did:sov`.  So an indy did will like look something like this:  `did:indy:7GF4e:1231243wer...` where the `7GF4e` is derived from a hash of something that will identify the network.  The exact mechanism to be used is to be determined.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 27 Oct 2020 18:14:39 GMT):<br/>
That allows DIDs to be resolvable on any published Indy network -- Sovrin, Sovrin Staging, IDUnion, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Tue, 27 Oct 2020 18:45:45 GMT):<br/>
ahhh, that makes sense.  Thanks!

Good day! I was wondering if it's possible to create a proof predicate comparing strings? I attempted setting the predicate to "=" and received the error telling me that it must be any of ">=","<=","<",">", so I was wondering if that is possible with proof predicates or only in attributes? Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Wed, 28 Oct 2020 12:47:43 GMT):<br/>
Currently it only supports integer comparisons, so the string has to be encoded as an integer. There is work underway to define those encodings on the ledger, but it's not done yet.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 28 Oct 2020 12:57:16 GMT):<br/>
Trickier yet -- a sortable encoding.
</p>
<p><strong>Lucampelli</strong> (Wed, 28 Oct 2020 13:28:21 GMT):<br/>
for now I'm just decimal encoding the string, so the way would be to encode the string and use it in two predicates? One <= and the other >=. because if it's true on both it means its ==. Right?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 28 Oct 2020 13:34:15 GMT):<br/>
That works.  Note that there is also a `restriction` that you can use for the equality of the value if that is all you are looking for.
</p>
<p><strong>Lucampelli</strong> (Wed, 28 Oct 2020 14:01:33 GMT):<br/>
How do I use then? Can't seem to find it in the docs...

I'm going through @esplinr 's indy-cli How-to to access sovrin buildernet. And I'm stuck in the step to write a schema. I set taa mechanism to be for_session in the cliconfig file. What else do I need? pool(buildernet):my_wallet:did(XD7...wvv):indy> ledger schema name=vswFirstSchema version=1.0 attr_names=FirstName,LastName,Address,Birthdate,SSN
Transaction author agreement Acceptance Mechanism isn't set.
pool(buildernet):my_wallet:did(XD7...wvv):indy> 
pool(buildernet):my_wallet:did(XD7...wvv):indy> ledger txn-acceptance-mechanisms aml={"taaAcceptanceMechanism":"for_session"} version=2.0
Transaction has been rejected: Not enough TRUSTEE signatures
</p>
<p><strong>wenjing</strong> (Wed, 28 Oct 2020 21:35:34 GMT):<br/>
Btw, here is the How-to I was following, except I ignored the payment-address, guessing it's no longer required. https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Token-Test-Instructions.pdf. What am I missing? Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>Lucampelli</strong> (Wed, 28 Oct 2020 21:57:53 GMT):<br/>
which restriction? right now I could only find that it restricts for schema id and other things but not the value
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 28 Oct 2020 22:52:08 GMT):<br/>
Restrictions come in 6 forms:

- schema ID
- schema Issuer (DID)
- Cred Def ID
- Cred Def Issuer (DID)
- attribute name (e.g. claim name)
- attribute value

So if you Cred Def ID and attribute value, you have the equivalent of an "equal" predicate.  You are exposing the data, but that's OK if it's equality you are after -- if you a claim is equal to value, you know the value.
</p>
<p><strong>Lucampelli</strong> (Wed, 28 Oct 2020 22:52:24 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>brentzundel</strong> (Thu, 29 Oct 2020 16:43:55 GMT):<br/>
on staging net and builder net you have the option of either use the token plugin, or to use transaction endorsers
</p>
<p><strong>brentzundel</strong> (Thu, 29 Oct 2020 16:45:17 GMT):<br/>
this website can help you get setup with tokens or endorser status on staging net: https://selfserve.sovrin.org/

<p><strong>wenjing</strong> (Thu, 29 Oct 2020 16:54:18 GMT):<br/>
Ok. I plugged in DID and verkey (again left the payment address field blank) in the selfserve page and it seems to work. Once this DID becomes an endorser, it can do write operations without tokens. Is that right understanding?
</p>
<p><strong>brentzundel</strong> (Thu, 29 Oct 2020 16:54:43 GMT):<br/>
that is correct
</p>
<p><strong>wenjing</strong> (Thu, 29 Oct 2020 16:57:32 GMT):<br/>
Thanks! very helpful to clear up some doubts. Is there a good place to figure out how the mainnet handle payments? like api definition?
</p>
<p><strong>brentzundel</strong> (Thu, 29 Oct 2020 16:58:07 GMT):<br/>
tokens are not currently used on mainnet, all transactions need to be signed by an endorser
</p>
<p><strong>wenjing</strong> (Thu, 29 Oct 2020 17:00:44 GMT):<br/>
I see. Presumably the endorser would create a "normal" payment account with sovrin to handle fees? Are there any other conditions for anyone to become an endorser?
</p>
<p><strong>brentzundel</strong> (Thu, 29 Oct 2020 17:02:11 GMT):<br/>
That is my understanding, but for specifics you'll need to reach out to Sovrin directly. I'd recommend asking questions on chat.sovrin.org
</p>
<p><strong>wenjing</strong> (Thu, 29 Oct 2020 17:03:27 GMT):<br/>

Another problem popped up. The "ledger cred-def" command requires "primary" which is said to be the "primary key in json format".   What is this? how to find it or create it?
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 29 Oct 2020 17:58:29 GMT):<br/>
The `ledger cred-def` command cannot be run from the indy-cli without using an external program to build/create the primary key.  I suggest switching completely to code to reliably create the cred-def.
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 29 Oct 2020 18:00:21 GMT):<br/>
payment address is optional for writing txns to the network, but is required if you are testing token functionality.
</p>
<p><strong>wenjing</strong> (Thu, 29 Oct 2020 18:48:52 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. That's what I thought as I follow the How-to coding series in the doc. By the way, for anyone who wants the details - the anoncred paper is where the ultimate answer is. The indy-cli tutorial probably should find a way to remove its reference by a higher level of simplification.

HI i am working on a RN project which uses indy. I am trying to implement the issue credential flow and the second phase of generating the credential request from prover side is causing issue for me. I debugged the java code in android studio and found that the issue is happening in the rust indy api lib.
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/a21383cb960a008ce5ba976a2054c323696b5946/libindy/src/api/anoncreds.rs#L945
The param check in the indy_prover_create_credential_req  api function is throwing invalid structure error
</p>
<p><strong>MathewJoseph</strong> (Tue, 03 Nov 2020 06:51:50 GMT):<br/>
I used the data i passed to the rust function and found this error
*thread ‘main’ panicked at ‘called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: IndyError { error_code: CommonInvalidStructure, message: “Error: Invalid structure\n  Caused by: UrsaCryptoError: Invalid Credential key correctness proof\n”, indy_backtrace: Some(“”) }’, src/issue-credential.rs:118:197
note: run*
</p>
<p><strong>MathewJoseph</strong> (Tue, 03 Nov 2020 06:53:05 GMT):<br/>
I deep dived into the rust code and found that
*pub struct CredentialKeyCorrectnessProof {
    c: BigNumber,
    xz_cap: BigNumber,
    xr_cap: Vec<(String, BigNumber)>,
}*
</p>
<p><strong>MathewJoseph</strong> (Tue, 03 Nov 2020 06:54:27 GMT):<br/>
The same cred offer is working fine in python

<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 03 Nov 2020 14:34:46 GMT):<br/>
Hi all, I have a question related to requesting proof for multiple credentials of the same type. E.g. lets say, as a holder, I have 10 vaccination credentials in my wallet. All from the same schema, but different credential_definitions. Each credential represents a single vaccination I received. When I go to my doctor I want to show proof of all received vaccinations. It seems like this is not possible with the current version of indy. Has anyone already put any thought into this scenario? Seems like a somewhat common use case, that I’m curious to see how it will work
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Tue, 03 Nov 2020 14:36:53 GMT):<br/>
you can show them one at a time?  Do you want to combine proofs?
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 03 Nov 2020 15:01:39 GMT):<br/>
One at a time would be possible, but this introduces some overhead and (I think) also eliminates the possibility to check all credentials are issued to the same holder (using link/master secret)
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Tue, 03 Nov 2020 15:06:26 GMT):<br/>
I agree on the overhead, on the second part I think you would just need to keep state.  No reason that you can't check their provenance all originates with the same holder.
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Tue, 03 Nov 2020 15:06:47 GMT):<br/>
although maybe I'm misinformed about that.  I am pretty new to this project

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 03 Nov 2020 15:20:46 GMT):<br/>
You need to use the `--config` option when starting the `cli`:
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#options
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 03 Nov 2020 15:21:18 GMT):<br/>
Content of you config file should be at least:
```
{
  "taaAcceptanceMechanism": "for_session"
}
```

<p><strong>san1ker</strong> (Wed, 04 Nov 2020 06:53:09 GMT):<br/>
Hi team!
While studying, I found writing credential definition takes more time and has larger time deviation than writing schema to the ledger.
(Time dev of writing schema is very uniform)
Can I ask why??
Thanks!!!

I don't know the extractly flow of add new trustee, is it need approved by other trustees?
</p>
<p><strong>dgt1nsty</strong> (Wed, 04 Nov 2020 14:04:14 GMT):<br/>
is trustee and trust anchor are the same thing?
</p>
<p><strong>dgt1nsty</strong> (Wed, 04 Nov 2020 14:05:33 GMT):<br/>
if it is according to doc of sdk becoming a Trust Anchor requires contacting a person or organization who already has the Trust Anchor role on the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 04 Nov 2020 16:19:02 GMT):<br/>
A trustee is the highest level access on the system and are (usually) required for creating any elevated role DIDs, and for operations that affect the network -- e.g. initiating upgrades of the software run by the nodes.

An Endorser (formerly Trust Anchor) can write or endorse the writing of "regular" DIDs (DIDs with no special privileges) and verifiable credential related objects (schema, cred def, rev reg and rev entries). An endorser may have to sign a legal agreement, and pay for any transaction that they endorse.  Those are required by Sovrin.

The roles are configurable, as are the number of signatures required.

Hi, I was navigating the indy codebase, trying to understand how DID Documents are registered, but I was not able to identify where it creates the DDo Creation transaction specified in the Sovrin DID Method¹. Any ideas? Thanks.

can we integrate caliper with indy for bench marking
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 05 Nov 2020 19:38:04 GMT):<br/>
no clue, have to ask someone else I'm afraid.

one man in #general told me that i have to wite a connector to integrate indy caliper

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 05 Nov 2020 20:57:41 GMT):<br/>
I don't know of anyone that has done anything with Caliper and Indy.

There is some detail in the JIRA's listed above about how the test was done.

Hi, I am building an identity solution for my school and we want it to be following a common standard that is universally verifiable. I have a few questions, will be great if I can get a response - 1. Does using Indy also mean I am compliant with w3c VC standards? 2. We are planning to go ahead with sov which provides me with a did of type sov, should I be looking at aries implementation? 3. When Indy too has a concept of channels authcrypt and decrypt etc. Is there a reason why I should look at aries? 4. Can I monitor the transactions of did type sov in the Indy scan net?

Question, is it possible to query secrets stored in an indy wallet ?

<p><strong>darkchylde</strong> (Mon, 09 Nov 2020 06:24:55 GMT):<br/>
for example signing keys

It is my understanding that this is intentionally NOT possible because it would prevent being able to implement the wallet using a backing HSM

Hello. I have the error "Transaction has been rejected: Not enough TRUSTEE signatures".
Before I : 
1. Connect to pool
2. Open wallet
3. Use TRUSTEE DID
4. Did "ledger nym did=... role=STEWARD verkey=..."
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 10 Nov 2020 02:35:12 GMT):<br/>
Don't have the instruction handy, but there is a command that dumps the config rules. Perhaps on the ledger you are using it takes more than one Trustee to add a Steward?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 10 Nov 2020 02:35:48 GMT):<br/>
If not that, then I would check on whether the DID you are using is a Trustee DID.

I've a question around an Indy read transaction's state proof. The multi_signature timestamp refers to the timestamp the state was last updated at right? I wonder if the state is still updated and that timestamp changes irrespective of any transactions being posted on to the ledger every fixed time interval? A quick analysis suggests so but I wanted to be sure
</p>
<p><strong>gnarula</strong> (Thu, 12 Nov 2020 07:37:50 GMT):<br/>
and is the time interval 5 minutes at the moment?

Hi all, 

I've been developing an Android Aries agent mplementation, along with a corresponding issuing/verifying agent server in Express.js and C++, on Windows.
On the server side, try as I might, the C Indy function callbacks don't seem to be called, and I've been coding C/C++ for 24 years, so I'm at a bit of a loss as to why.
As a temporary measure, I am talking to Indy by using ZeroMQ socket connections to the Indy Node.js wrapper and as insane as it sounds, this is working rather well. :)

The Android app is working nicely, and works with pretty much all of the BC Gov. issuers and verifiers, such as the Unverified Person Issuer and the Health Gateway verifier.
The server acts as a router when dealing with the BC sites and also works as an issuer for several test credentials.
I am almost done adding credential verification functionality to the server and have made sure that the schema_id, cred_def_id etc. are correctly used as keys for the corresponding JSON
array entries, where needed.

Indy is no longer yelling at me about missing or malformed data, but it would appear that the signatures do not match as 'false' is returned from Indy.verifierVerifyProof.
The encoded values in the issued credential match the values in the proof json (which I'm assuming is good), so I am rather confused as to what the problem is.
I've attached the following:
Verifying_Problems__Issued.txt - JSON console log of issued credential
Verifying_Problems__Verifying.txt - JSON console log of data sent to JS call indy.verifierVerifyProof
Verifying_Problems__Node.js - JS function call that calls Indy.verifierVerifyProof.

I've been through the ACA Py source code, stared at anoncreds.rs (I don't know Rust), and generally tried to figure this out, but I am embarrassed to admit that I'm rather stuck.
Please help, so that I can get this fixed and move on to implementing credential revocation.
Many thanks in advance.

Oh, I remember noticing that there was once a bug report for the Indy sdk where Indy.verifierVerifyProof was always returning true due to a casting issue (something about reading 4 bytes instead of 1 due to casting to an int or something).
Could this be a similar issue, assuming it's not me simpley being thick? :P

Hi everyone. I am in trouble with how key rotation works on Indy. In key compromise case it is clear. However, when everything is valid, how does it work? If an issuer issues a credential and then rotates its keys before verification process, how can a verifier verify this credential?
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Mon, 16 Nov 2020 13:52:21 GMT):<br/>
I think the credentials issued with the compromised key can't be verified at that point.

Unfortunately, it didn't change the result, it still fails to verify.
I solved the C++ callback problem and spent the weekend implementing the Indy calls so that my Agent server is now 100% C++.
The result is the same, it stil l doesn't verify.
Please see attached data, many thanks for looking at this.

Hmmm the only thing I notice is that the attribute names seem to be inconsistent (i.e. the names in the proof request, not the attribute names from the credential)
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Mon, 16 Nov 2020 16:54:09 GMT):<br/>
i.e. in the initial request_presentation attachment you have `attr1_referent` an attr2_referent`, but then in the proof_request_json you name them `email` and `website`

Hello, I'm currently looking through Indy documentation and wondering what the status of this page is: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/requests-new.md ? It's named "new", yet changes are 16 month ago(and therefore older than the requests page). Can anyone comment on the status of this?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 17 Nov 2020 00:50:20 GMT):<br/>
Some central concepts about this.  

Authorizations on the ledger are configurable, so in theory, the answer to your questions may be affected by the configuration of the specific ledger.

That said, in general the terms with the permissions are "Trustee", "Steward" and "Endorser" (formerly "Trust Anchor"). In general, Trustees will create all Stewards and Endorsers.  Stewards will ONLY be able to do operations that affect their node of the network, and would NOT create Endorsers. Further, Endorsers can create DIDs for Authors (no ability to create other DIDs), but that's it.

To your questions:

0. Change "Steward" to "Trustee" across the intro and the questions.
0. "a" is an Endorser and cannot create "b" another Endorser (caveat -- MAYBE the rules can be set up for that, but unlikely).
1. A Trustee may have authority to remove the "Endorser" privilege of "a" to just an Author.  A Trustee cannot change the verkey of the Endorser, and cannot delete the DID altogether.
2. Since "b" can only be created by the Trustee (not "a" unless "a" is a Trustee), the Trustee can operate as per the paragraph above about "a".
3. There is no "delegation" flow involving the two DIDs -- they are independent of one another.

Hope that helps.

Removing the /var/lib/indy/<network dir>/data directory on each node will reset the network to the genesis state.  To do this, stop indy-node service on every node, remove the directory on every node, then start indy-node again on every node.

Hello experts, I have a generic question, I am not sure if this is the right place to ask about it. In Verifiable Credentials, how a VC is correlated with an entity like a user? I read about Blinded Linked Secrets? but I could not find a lot of information about it anywhere? I am really surprised that such proving ownership is not talked about a lot in the documentation s and the W3C standards? Am I missing something? Does Hyperledger Indy have a different method for VC ownership? is there a documentation i am missing that explain those concepts?

</p>
<p><strong>paul.bastian</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 14:15:25 GMT):<br/>
Indy uses anoncreds. Credentials are not issued to a certain DID, but to the blinded link secret. the holder proves that 2 credentials belong to him by presenting the same signed link secret in both creds

Thank a lot Paul. I see now. But I have two questions: First, is this protocol fips compliant or has any sort of compliance or validation done to it? Second question which is not related: When an Issuer signs a Verifiable credentials (which include the blinded link secret), what DID public key is it signed with? is it the pairwise DID with the holder? or is it a special kind of DID that is published on the blockchain? In other words? does the Issuer use the same published DID for DID connections? or those are separate?
</p>
<p><strong>paul.bastian</strong> (Fri, 20 Nov 2020 15:10:30 GMT):<br/>
communication connection is done with DID public keys which translates to NYM verkeys, credential signing is done with credential definition CL keys
</p>

This I believe is the connection invite. I am unable to link this code to the creation of pairwise DID (as I was expecting). Would really appreciate if someone could point out in the code where in the process of creating a connection invite do pairwise DID get created.

<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 24 Nov 2020 09:19:01 GMT):<br/>
Indy SDK doesn't know about the concept of connections. Hyperledger Indy concerns with the issuing, holding, proving and verifying of credentials. It can also create and manage keys for you, which can be used in connections. Hyperledger indy doesn't concern with exchange of credentials or DIDs. Connections are a concept from Hyperledger Aries, for which you can use one of the available aries frameworks (aries-cloudagent-python, aries-framework-dotnet, aries-framework-go, ...)

Hey Paul, i really thank you for your answers. I have another question if you can answer: How relying party (verifier) do trust some issuer in a DID worlds? I am familiar with the concept of governance trust frameworks and members directory, and that those might be hosted on a blockchain, but how technically a relying party can find the list of trusted issuers (anchors) and who signs them?

I have faced the same problem and changed the indy-pool.dockerfile in the ci directory as follows:

1. add aptitude and apt-utils to the install environment

2. change the versions of each module as follows:
#ARG indy_plenum_ver=1.12.1~dev989
#ARG indy_node_ver=1.12.1~dev1172
ARG indy_plenum_ver=1.13.0~dev1220
ARG indy_node_ver=1.13.0~dev1220
ARG python3_indy_crypto_ver=0.4.5
ARG indy_crypto_ver=0.4.5
ARG python3_pyzmq_ver=18.1.0

3. change the installation command after the "ARG" section:
RUN apt-get update -y && aptitude install -f -y \
        python3-pyzmq=${python3_pyzmq_ver} \
        indy-plenum=${indy_plenum_ver} \
        indy-node=${indy_node_ver} \
        python3-indy-crypto=${python3_indy_crypto_ver} \
        libindy-crypto=${indy_crypto_ver} \
        ursa \
        python3-ursa \
        vim

With those changes, I was able to build the docker image. It also starts properly. However, I'm running into a different problem now, don't know if this is related to my changes. (Credential definition is panicking, no idea if this is caused by using different versions as in the original file, will have to figure this out).

        indy-plenum=${indy_plenum_ver} \
        indy-node=${indy_node_ver} \
        python3-indy-crypto=${python3_indy_crypto_ver} \
        libindy-crypto=${indy_crypto_ver} \
        ursa \
        python3-ursa \
        vim

Hi Experts, has anyone been able to run the file found in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/v1.11.0/samples/java/src/main/java/Anoncreds.java without problems? I get a panic error message: "thread '<unnamed>' panicked at 'attempted to leave type `linked_hash_map::Node<std::string::String, raw_statement::RawStatement>` uninitialized, which is invalid', /build/rust/src/rustc-1.48.0-src/library/core/src/mem/mod.rs:658:9" 

I have also got the full stack trace, if it helps. The panic occurs in line 53 of the file: 
AnoncredsResults.IssuerCreateAndStoreCredentialDefResult createCredDefResult = issuerCreateAndStoreCredentialDef(issuerWallet, issuerDid, schemaJson, credDefTag, null, credDefConfigJson).get();

Any hints what I could do about that? I'm running a local indy docker image, using a locally built libindy, debug version (from indy-sdk project). However, the same error also occurs when I use libindy-1.15.0-1 from Arch User Repos. (The stack trace says a little more with the locally built version, though, the AUR version is a release version without debug info).

Hi All,

I was wondering if anyone could point me to documentation around which port ranges/ports are used for indy nodes in the node pools in the various networks (builder, staging, mainnet). Based off the genesis files, we can see ports such as 9701, 9702 etc. But is there any explicit spec or documentation around this? This matters a lot for network firewalls and what traffic we should be allowing through.

Thanks!

indy is open to anyone to use but indy is the name of the technology, instances of indy (like the Sovrin chain `did:sov` method) each have their own protocol for integration if you want write access.  Usually the public has read access.

A schema is a small JSON object, whose size varies according to the number of attributes, each of which is a single string.
Conversely, a cred def is a large JSON object, with a 256-bit integer for each attribute in the schema. a cred def for a schema with 2 attributes will be much smaller than a cred def for a schema with 20 attributes.
Are you noticing the time difference between cred defs of similar size, or are the cred defs differently sized?

The rules for what permissions are required to create DIDs of different roles are different for each ledger. 
On Sovrin main net, a Steward does not have permission to create an Endorser (Trust Anchor). An Endorser also does not have permission to create another Endorser.

Hi Experts,
Needed your opinion on Indyscan?
It looks good, just wanted to confirm from you guys if its a stable and safe tool to use?
This is the link :- https://github.com/Patrik-Stas/indyscan
Any faced any issues with this?
Thanks for you time.

Hi guys, if I want to intergrate Hyperledger Indy to my Ethereum dapp, is that possible? Does anyone have any useful resources/links to learn how to use Hyperledger Indy? I've gone through the github but still find the learning entry barrier quite high
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Tue, 01 Dec 2020 11:57:09 GMT):<br/>

Hi @wip-abramson thanks for the reply! My dapp is a ticketing system on Ethereum (so we could regulate the secondary market etc). I would like to integrate some sort of decentralised identity management use case to the dapp for events attendees, so I just come across Indy. But since I'm new to hyperledger everything seems quite foreign to me right now haha. So would like get started on learning indy and also understand whether it is possible to integrate a permissioned identity management into a dapp built on a permissionless network
</p>
<p><strong>kaijuneer</strong> (Tue, 01 Dec 2020 12:05:08 GMT):<br/>
That seems like good resources! I'll check them out, really appreciate your help
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Tue, 01 Dec 2020 14:18:24 GMT):<br/>
Well Indy is just the ledger - https://indyscan.io/home/SOVRIN_MAINNET you want to use Hyperledger Aries which is at the application layer. Allowing connect to other agents, issue, store and present credentials etc
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Tue, 01 Dec 2020 14:36:46 GMT):<br/>
Hi KaushalIngle, author here. It's running on indyscan.io prety stable against Sovrin networks, in past I've encountered issue where indysdk was reporting no new transactions on the ledger, even though there actually were. Perhaps it was ledger issue, or maybe something in indysdk, I don't know. It didn't happen for several weeks now. In general it's running with minimal devops maintenance on my side for couple months.
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Tue, 01 Dec 2020 14:37:51 GMT):<br/>
As for the stability of the code and APIs, it can change, there's features I would like to add and it might require changes how the data is stored.
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Tue, 01 Dec 2020 14:38:58 GMT):<br/>
That probably won't happen for at least couple months as I am right now overloaded with other business :-)
</p>
<p><strong>Lucampelli</strong> (Tue, 01 Dec 2020 14:41:14 GMT):<br/>
Well, thanks for your reply, but that raises two questions:
First: In this case scenario you described, how are new Trust Anchors (Endorsers) created?
Second: In my case scenario, in the test network where everything is allowed, how those 3 questions I asked work?

Hi KaushalIngle, I mad a fork of Indyscan for the Indicio Networks and it is running great for me. indyscan.indiciotech.io
To make a prototype and see it working on my own machine was a matter of a few hours as Patrik did a great job of making that quite simple to do.  It took a bit more effort to get the different parts running as services on a public, AWS, Ubuntu 18.04 server and I am happy to share the notes I took while building that with anyone who is interested. (I am not an expert on Linux services, but it is all up and running for a few weeks now)

On Sovrin main net, a Trustee must sign the transaction to create an Endorser.
I'm not sure what the auth rules are for the other Sovrin networks. I do know that indy-cli has a command to retrive the auth rules ( I think it is: `get_auth_rules`)

</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 01 Dec 2020 16:57:31 GMT):<br/>
`dev` to develop against the latest, `test` if you need something a bit more stable.

Hi PatrikStas, 
Thanks for the rundown, quick response and for creating the tool. I was on the lookout for something similar. I will go ahead with it and will be on the lookout for the ledger issue.
Hi lynn.bendixsen,
Thinking of making a fork and using it as per needed. Good to know that it can be done easily. 
I would be really grateful if you could share your notes. It will make my work that much easier. 
Thanks a lot.

The Readme's that Patrik has are pretty good and they might work best for what you want to do, but here are the detailed notes I took: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1noHYmudrIyeqDh_Gitjo8LGXAC9duo7OpgYomvIGkoQ/edit?usp=sharing 
Look at Appendix A for how I set up our public IndyScan server for the Indicio networks.

It looks like your nym is in your wallet, but has not yet been written to the BuilderNet ledger.  https://selfserve.sovrin.org has a form you can fill in (ignore the token part) to get your nym on the ledger as an Endorser.

You can get an Endorser DID on the Sovrin BuilderNet or StagingNet from this site -- https://selfserve.sovrin.org/

You can ignore the payment address pieces.

For production use case with Sovrin MainNet, there is a formal process to get an Endorser DID and transaction fees associated with using it.

Hi everybody. Hope this question fits to this channel since it is about mobile mobile wallet apps: I found this Sovrin elaboration by @danielhardman regarding disaster recovery for mobile wallets (https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/What-if-someone-steals-my-phone-110319.pdf). A "device revocation feature" is mentioned, which I do not find in any other "not Sovrin" docs so far. Is this a (still existing) "Sovrin only" feature, or is there some equivalent in the general Hyperledger Indy space? And if there is not: When a wallet apps offer some kind of export / backup functionality, how can one make sure, that the backup is not imported as copy to a wallet app of a total different user (in order to "copy" identities)? I am pretty sure, that this is not the first time this kind of question was posted, but I would appreciate any hint very much...
</p>
<p><strong>Alexandru-MihailAdam</strong> (Thu, 10 Dec 2020 13:55:46 GMT):<br/>
I'm trying to write a schema on the Builder Network on Sovrin. I received a endorser DID, used it, but when i'm trying to submitRequest i get the following error: `{"op":"REQNACK","reason":"client request invalid: insufficient number of valid signatures, 1 is required but 0 valid and 1 invalid have been provided. The following signatures are invalid: did=KgHAvbiM4y6RHqJZHx2EGX, signature=2TEPnSQRUNmTjAj8zfQukTXqX7fZpQBKzyoAdAXqR5VJC1bG61vy6Zmy6RqzxX11VRLMtwQAh9JJyXwop9aD1zKH","reqId":1607608160786862225,"identifier":"KgHAvbiM4y6RHqJZHx2EGX"}`

<p><strong>Alexandru-MihailAdam</strong> (Thu, 10 Dec 2020 14:15:23 GMT):<br/>
PS: I checked my DID on indyscan.io as a NYM tx and it's published on the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>ArturPhilipp</strong> (Thu, 10 Dec 2020 14:30:06 GMT):<br/>
Are you using Indy CLI for the schema transaction? Are you connected to the correct pool (buildernet)?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 14:58:30 GMT):<br/>
Aries Cloud Agent Python has full support for revocation as an issuer/verifier, so you can use that.  I'm not sure of the status in the other frameworks.

The /demo directory has some example code showing revocation in action.

Hi all. I decided to try some of the indy tutorials directly after learning a bunch through #aries-cloudagent-python. I am trying the getting-started one (https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/sdk/en/latest/docs/getting-started/run-getting-started.html) from a freshly cloned copy of `indy-sdk`, launching from the `indy-sdk/docs/getting-started/` directory. Bringing up the network via `docker-compose up` fails with the following error. Looks like version problems for `indy-plenum` dependencies. I haven't tried to fix this on my own yet - but thought this group might like to know since it's the most basic walkthrough piece a newcomer might encounter.

```

Just realized this may have been a better fit for #indy-sdk and checked there. Sure enough - problem was reported and answer was found. See the thread here https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy-sdk/thread/cWq34By6rBvyGkAiR?jump=q4KbJYrDTrPqeCmwf

Basic gist: need to edit the `indy-sdk/ci/indy-pool.dockerfile` (to pin appropriate versions of the dependencies) and `indy-sdk/docs/getting-started/docker-compose.yml` (to get f-strings support on Python 3.6). Issue's open on github, so I trust this'll get included soon.

Hi, I haven't worked with Indy so far and I want to know how I can updated the DID document that that it follows this convention for the did-communication service: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0067-didcomm-diddoc-conventions#service-conventions

What's the quickest and easiest way to achieve that? I read about "NYM" transactions so far. But not sure how to achieve what I want. Maybe someone can give me a quick hint. Thanks! :)

Translation from Indy network data to DID doc is handled in the sovrin DID Method so far, and you can use a n ATTRIB for adding a service endpoint. However this is pretty outdated and there is currently a group working on a brand new Indy DID Method that will work for all indy networks

Hi Team,
</p>
<p><strong>Shweta1</strong> (Mon, 21 Dec 2020 14:58:57 GMT):<br/>
I am trying to create 3 indy node individual docker container and then create indy ledger browser server.For this I used ci/indy-pool.dockerfile and created three docker container. and then throgh this container I initialize and start node and then create genesis transaction.I followed follwing steps but getting poolledgertimeout error.


 docker build -f indy-node.dockerfile -t indy-node1 .
 docker run -itd -p 9701-9702:9701-9702 indy-node1
 
 docker build -f indy-node.dockerfile -t indy-node2 .
 docker run -itd -p 9703-9704:9703-9704 indy-node2

  Go to Node 1 docker container
  
 init_indy_keys --name Node1 
 start_indy_node Node1 127.0.0.1 9701 127.0.0.1 9702 &
 generate_indy_pool_transactions --nodes 2 --clients 3 --nodeNum 1 --ips '127.0.0.1,127.0.0.1'

 Go to Node 1 docker container
 
 init_indy_keys --name Node2
 start_indy_node Node2 127.0.0.1 9703 127.0.0.1 9704 &
 generate_indy_pool_transactions --nodes 2 --clients 3 --nodeNum 2 --ips '127.0.0.1,127.0.0.1'

up indy local ledger 

 docker build -f indy-local-server.dockerfile -t indy-webserver .
 
 docker run -dti -v /opt/von-network:/von-network -p 9000:9000 indy-webserver 
 
 go to webserver container
 
 GENESIS_FILE=../my_genesis.txn PORT=9000 python -m server.server
 
 but http://Ipaddress:9000 gives poolledgertimeout error.

I think you need to substitute whatever docker's internal host IP address is, von-network uses this to find it: `docker run --rm --net=host eclipse/che-ip`

<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Tue, 22 Dec 2020 06:55:04 GMT):<br/>
instead of 127.0.0.1

At least 4 nodes are required. Docker networking can be complicated, I can't really diagnose that. Also you don't need to rebuild the docker image for each node

Thanks andrew,it's working with 3 nodes.I diagonose the problem.Actually I am starting node by providing IP 127.0.0.1 it should be 0.0.0.0 like this  "start_indy_node Node1 0.0.0.0 9701 0.0.0.0 9702 &".YesI dont need to create separate image.Thanks a lot again

1. you should ask indicio directly for best answers :)
2. yes, it's HL indy based
3. you can connect via instructions on their website https://indicio.tech/indicio-testnet/ or, the easiest way is to sign up for a trinsic account and use a trinsic cloud agent (based on aries) http://trinsic.studio 
4. credentials issued from one network need to be verified using that same network. however an agent that issues credentials on Sovrin could also verify credentials coming from Indicio or visa-versa. Hope that makes sense

The error implies that the image name is wrong. Find the Dockerfile and change postgresql to postgres. That error implies a typo... There's no postgresql in dockerhub, but there's postgres

The buildGetSchemaRequest method succeeds and when I call the parseGetSchemaResponse I get the following error, looking for some pointers on where to continue my investigation as when I look at the rust code it seems to be looking for the "op" as you can see below it is not in the JSON, is this a version mismatch between the sdk and the indy-node... or something else?

Hello! To answer your specific question: To add a TRUSTEE you must use an existing TRUSTEE DID. Depending on how the Auth_rules are set up, you might need more than one TRUSTEE signature to add a new TRUSTEE.  
The screenshot you sent adds a little bit of confusion, though.  A Trust Anchor is not the same as a TRUSTEE. The older term "Trust Anchor" has been replaced by "Transaction Endorser" (or in a lot of the doc's it's just referred to as  "ENDORSER") Adding an ENDORSER DID to your test ledger also requires one or more TRUSTEE signatures.

Hi Indy Team, I have a question:
- 1. Do DID generated by libindy have a corresponding Did Document? Is there a way to see it via libindy?
- 2. I assume that there's a corresponding private key with every verkey. Is there a way to see it via libindy?

I am assuming that there's did doc from every DID that libindy generates because of this document:
https://sovrin-foundation.github.io/sovrin/spec/did-method-spec-template.html

And the peer did: https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/

Hi @lynn.bendixsen thanks!

I managed to figure out the DID of a trustee, and it's seed, thus I was able to add my very own trustee.

For everyone, here's your clue:
http://greenlight.bcovrin.vonx.io/browse/domain

1. Run a new node using von-network.
2. Browse localhost:9000/browse/domain and look for DID that is marked as trustee
3. Hunt the seed of that DID in google
4. build_nym_request --> role='TRUSTEE' and send via sign_and_submit_request

I recommend von-network as your indy node so that you'll have way to browse to indy blockchain. von-network is basically indy-node with UI.

Simply put:
- 1. I found this DID: V4SGRU86Z58d6TV7PBUe6f with a role of trustee.
- 2. Thanks to google, I found it's seed: 000000000000000000000000Trustee1
- 3. Generate a DID using create_and_store_my_did and use the seed above
- 4. Control your indy node!
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 05 Jan 2021 00:47:45 GMT):<br/>
For 1, the answer is yes and no :-).

Within LibIndy, there are three elements associated with the DID -- the verkey (public key), the private key and the DID identifier.  The latter is derived from the first verkey for a DID, so if you change the verkey and private key (e.g. rotate the keys), the DID identifier remains the same.  A DIDDoc can be constructed using three elements, but there is literal document stored.  Once you publish the NYM to an Indy Ledger, a resolver (such as the universal resolver) will retrieve those elements and return a formatted DIDDoc.  If you also add an ATTRIB to the ledger with an "endpoint" as the data value, the Universal Resolver will include that as a fourth element of the DIDDoc. Likewise, an endpoint can be added to a Peer DID.

2. There is a private key. Libindy does not give you a way to get that, as it would be insecure. The less handling of the private key the better.

</p>
<p><strong>ghabxph</strong> (Tue, 05 Jan 2021 08:11:49 GMT):<br/>
The idea is:
1. Create a schema
2. Create a credential definition 

**Create Schema**
anoncreds.issuer_create_schema
ledger.build_schema_request
ledger.sign_and_submit_request

**Create cred def**
(cred_def_id, cred_def_json) = await anoncreds.issuer_create_and_store_credential_def

Send the:
cred_def_id and cred_def_json
to the prover

Here's your guide:

</p>
<p><strong>ghabxph</strong> (Tue, 05 Jan 2021 08:15:53 GMT):<br/>
Now, I haven't fully explored Aries yet, but I think the idea is to send that cred def id and cred def json to the prover to send the link secret and so on.

thanks @ghabxph  yes all that works, but as in the following diagram

there is a step before you reply to credential-offer (which is coming from the issuer

<p><strong>alvaradojl</strong> (Tue, 05 Jan 2021 08:19:19 GMT):<br/>
so now i want to implement the flow, starting from the "holder" which is sending a credential proposal
</p>
<p><strong>alvaradojl</strong> (Tue, 05 Jan 2021 08:19:59 GMT):<br/>
they also mentioned it could be similar to have a credential preview, maybe you know how to create that credential preview?

Hello, in the Aries spec https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0104-chained-credentials/README.md for chained credentials it says some work has already been done in Indy in regards to this work.  Was hoping to implement this in acapy but would need someone to direct me along the way.  I asked in the #aries-cloudagent-python but if anyone in here has information on what it would take to do this I'd love to get it.

Good Day! I would like to ask if Credentials ever make to the public Ledger, or are they only stored in the wallets of the one who created it and the one who received it?
</p>
<p><strong>Lucampelli</strong> (Mon, 11 Jan 2021 13:00:04 GMT):<br/>
Good Day! A question that popped up was: Considering one's wallet is stored in a physical medium in one's possession, be it a computer (with the Indy Client), a SmartCard, a SmartPhone whatever. What can be done to recover a wallet in case of device destruction? Would indy be working side by side with another Ledger in order to keep track of all credentials and DID's for this case?
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Mon, 11 Jan 2021 14:07:40 GMT):<br/>
@Lucampelli , I think Indy was designed so that credentials never go on the ledger.  Just public dids, revocation registries, schema defs, credential defs
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Mon, 11 Jan 2021 14:08:13 GMT):<br/>
As to where they're stored, I think that's entirely up to the good faith of the issuer, verifier, and holder
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 11 Jan 2021 15:10:27 GMT):<br/>
As @daidoji noted, the credentials are issued to the holder and held in their secure storage.  That storage can be backed up and restored as needed.  That said, both the secure storage of the credentials, and the handling of the backups has to be done with care to prevent others from getting access to the private keys and the credentials.   As noted, the credentials never go on a ledger -- the ledger holds identifiers and public keys of issuers and metadata about the credentials -- credential schema and revocation data.
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Mon, 11 Jan 2021 16:50:30 GMT):<br/>
Which "data" are you referring to?  Just the ledgers?  
What I usually recommend is to get a complete snapshot so that the node can be restored quickly to contribution level.  The data for the ledgers themselves are restored automatically from other nodes within a short period of time of restarting, even if the ledgers need restored from scratch.

I've wanted to see how DID documents are stored on Indy (if at all), but it seems that there are stored some kind of credentials (?)
For example, in the GET_ATTRIB example in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/requests.md you can request the "dateOfBirth" attribute.
Where is this dateOfBirth coming from? (Is it some part of a VC? I don't think so, as there is no VC specified, and in my understanding VC aren't stored on the ledger.)
What is it exactly that is stored as "NYM" (and referenced by a DID) in Indy (in the context of SSI)?
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>etaleo</strong> (Tue, 19 Jan 2021 12:09:51 GMT):<br/>
So, as far as I understand, Indy does not follow the concept of DID documents and Verifiable Credentials (yet) as specified by W3, but instead has a different way of handling identites and related information to them, right?
I'm still confused about where the similarites and differences are exactly.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Tue, 19 Jan 2021 12:19:36 GMT):<br/>
`dateOfBirth` is an example attribute. To my understanding an ATTRIB is just a key value storage tied to a did. If you for example look at the universal did resolver for `did:sov` it uses a get nym + get attrib to retrieve the did + endpoint (https://github.com/decentralized-identity/uni-resolver-driver-did-sov/blob/main/src/main/java/uniresolver/driver/did/sov/DidSovDriver.java#L148-L202). There is currently being worked on a `did:indy` method that does align with the DID spec, however I believe it will still use nym and attrib requests under the hood
</p>
<p><strong>etaleo</strong> (Tue, 19 Jan 2021 12:37:42 GMT):<br/>
Thank you. How is Indy able to resolve the dateOfBirth request, or in other words how does Indy know where the information is stored / how does Indy relate the information to the DID?

All, trying to do some performance testing credentials issuance with revocation registry size as 50K, It is taking approx 3 mins just to create the Credentials Definition and then 5 mins just to issue a single credential. So it is too slow. But with no revocation registry credential issuance is almost immediate. I am using aries-cloudagent:py36-1.14-1_0.5.1 and using 4 node Indy VON Network from https://github.com/bcgov/von-network. Wallet database being used here is SQLLite only. The CPU and memory utilization are all with in the limit, don't think it has any thing to do with infra. Any pointers on how to optimize this ?

Question about https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/IS-1545 and https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-2327 and a wider question that doesn't seem to have a clear answer.  What exactly is the delta between W3C VC spec and Indy credentials?  I know enough to know that they're different but don't know enough to know how to list out all those differences.  Is it just this Rich Schema context that's missing or what?  Is there a list somewhere or is this something I just have to crawl the specs for to determine myself?
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 16:10:59 GMT):<br/>
The second looks like a bug but normally one doesn't need to mess with the genesis file I don't think so I'm not exactly sure what safeguards there are around that. 

Can both servers write to the same ledger that you're using??
</p>
<p><strong>x0axz</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 16:19:17 GMT):<br/>
no.. different servers and different ledger
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 16:21:00 GMT):<br/>
ahh then the issue is that those public dids are bound to the ledger.  If you create the did on one ledger and then try to use it on an issuer that's reading from the second ledger you're likely to get a failure.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 20:03:41 GMT):<br/>
Indy credentials are not W3C standard. The signature schema (CL Signatures) could be made W3C standard, but that has not been done, and there was some work on that with Rich Schema, but I believe that has been abandoned.  Our plan (ACA-Py/BC Gov and others) is to instead move to BBS+ Signatures with JSON-LD to both achieve W3C Standard format with ZKP and Selective Disclosure support.

To now, none of the W3C Standard formats or implementations (other than BBS+) achieves ZKP or selective disclosure, which we think is crucial.

We continue to use Aries using Indy VCs for now because (a) the tech stack is rich and complete and interoperable based on Aries Interop 1.0, (b) there is a large community of collaborators and deployments, and (c) the Aries protocols give us a the protocols needed to exchange credentials and proof while evolving the VC payloads (e.g. from Indy Anoncreds to BBS+).

Hope that helps.
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 20:07:55 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran that helps a lot.  

Did the Aries-Go implementation take another route?  Like where do Indy Anoncreds end and the Aries interop profile say begin?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 20:11:36 GMT):<br/>
AFGo skipped the use of Indy, anoncreds and the AIP 1.0 protocols.   Until recently they did not support ZKP or selective disclosure, but recently added support for BBS+, which will provide those capabilities.

On the down side, because they skipped Indy and AIP 1.0, we're not able to use AFGo in any use cases with ACA-Py or the Aries.Net framework.  We expect that to change over the next few months, but it's going to be a bit yet.
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 20:51:10 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran thanks again.  Here's another question that might help clear up the last bit of misunderstanding I have.

Lets say there's another credential format tomorrow. "ieee vc" or something like that.  Would the AIP be able to support that too?  Like are the credential formats (and crypto primitives) tightly bound to the protocols?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 20:56:03 GMT):<br/>
The goal of Aries 2.0 is to make it easy to extend.  The credential exchange protocols define the interactions, and leave the payloads open, so that handlers for different payloads (formats) can be added, and the protocols still work.

Of course, a specific deployment would have to have support for the format and it's underlying crypto (no magic :-) ), but it can be plugged in, and the protocols allow negotiation about what format to use -- e.g. payloads that both support.

So an offer might say -- "I have a credential to give you and I support formats anoncreds, JWTs and ieee vc -- what format do you want?"
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 21:05:37 GMT):<br/>
okay, I think that makes more sense.
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 21:06:13 GMT):<br/>
right now though acapy could only say "I support anoncreds" and aries-go can only say "I support w3c vc jwts" right?
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 10:14:14 GMT):<br/>
This is an interesting thread. I am wondering what is the point of supporting the VC Data Model for the credential side with signature schemes like CL and BBS+. The whole point is creating a fresh presentation each time so no one needs to interoperate with my VC. 

I see the value in moving towards a standard presentation format. 

Maybe I am missing something though, is the idea that it makes it easier to move wallets?

</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 14:26:00 GMT):<br/>
Like in an ideal future I can take any credential in the wild, it'll be spec'd to VC data model, a few standard crypto primitives, and I'll be able to use those primitives and the data model without caring how its generated
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 14:33:51 GMT):<br/>
I mean it depends on your use case, but in general all the agents mediator or not, would need to be able to read from the same ledger (and write if they're establishing new credentials or public dids)
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 15:01:31 GMT):<br/>
Agree with the ideal, but the phrase "a few standard crypto primitives" is where it gets interesting.  That has to be balanced with a desire to have a VC with attributes like ZKP and selective disclosure. TLS-style crypto doesn't get you those characteristics, but it is achievable with crypto that has been around since the early 2000s and is used elsewhere.

Where do you draw the line?

<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 15:20:06 GMT):<br/>
Yeah you can only take the credentials with advanced crypto is you "understand" how to. Very different from just storing essentially a document with a signature against it. 

So my question is why go to the effort of conforming to the data model for the credential object. Whats the value add?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 22 Jan 2021 15:27:17 GMT):<br/>
Wow, Will, I'm impressed.  A question like that on a Friday afternoon.  :-)

It is a good question.  I think the drivers of the standard started with the ideal above, decided they didn't need the "fancy" stuff and went ahead.

That said, BBS+ Signatures does allow sticking to the format while achieving the desirable characteristics.   But at the cost that the parties must support that crypto.

Hahahaha yeah it certainly feels like the VC Data model was never designed with this crypto in mind. 

I guess standards are always a compromise. 

I would love to follow along with the work going into BBS+ in aca-py. Did you select someone to work on this contract yet?

Hi, I'm trying to **Write DID on Ledger** by following this: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/docs/how-tos/write-did-and-query-verkey/cs/WriteDIDAndQueryVerkey.cs 

On Step 2, the Pool is created successfully, but at the time of opening pool ledger, it returns this error.
`IndyException: An unmapped error with the code '307' was returned by the SDK.`

Hi all, a Pool with Steward Role is running on AWS server controlled by me. Now, I wanted to add multiple Trust Anchors, which are running on different servers. 

I did one experiment, I used the genesis file form AWS Server in Trust Anchor server (which has 4 nodes with Steward Server IP), and didn't start docker and was able to Create Schema & Credential Definition.

Now, I've some questions.
1) Was that a right approach? if not, then what's the right way to create network like this?
2) Is there any need to run a docker on Trust anchor (I didn't run earlier)?
3) To add the Trust Anchor, have to add node_ip of the Trust Anchor's server in genesis file on Steward server?
4) How to add and remove the Trust Anchor in network?
5) How to generate DID for Trust Anchor?
6) If network is running, and I have add a new Trust Anchor, how to add it?

Is there anything else I should know about?

Hi all, I’ve finished what I believe is an interesting document describing an effective solution for the SSI Personal Data Usage Licensing (SSI-PDUL) problem and would appreciate your comments and feedback. 
You can edit a Google Docs copy of my Word master version of the whitepaper here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yP0OgDhq-3TTIien5gsETi4jZdyiKbwE/edit
If you prefer to read a PDF version, you can download it from here: https://hyperonomy.com/2021/01/27/self-sovereign-identity-personal-data-usage-licensing-ssi-pdul-model-solution-concept-review-draft-0-27/
One, what I believe to be an authoritative, comment that I’ve received so far is: Otherwise, I think it's a pretty unstudied problem.
Abstract
The purpose of this solution concept whitepaper is to provide the first complete description of the motivations, key concepts, problem statement, and solution approach for implementing the Self-Sovereign Identity Personal Data Usage Licensing (SSI-PDUL) Model, a functional component of the Self-Sovereign Identity Model (SSI Model).
This solution concept addresses the following user scenario:
How Alice User, an App User and Identity Owner, and Bob Developer, an App Developer and App Controller, might negotiate the use of Alice’s personal digital identifiers and any associated personal identity data by Bob’s app, based on Self-Sovereign Identity Model Usage Principles.
The scope of the Self-Sovereign Identity Personal Data Usage Licensing (SSI-PDUL) Model is personal digital identifiers and any associated identity data presented by Alice to the App. It does not include the permissioning of data internal to the App (although the natural extension of the solution to internal data is an obvious one).
The intended audience for this whitepaper is a broad range of professionals interested in furthering the application and use of the SSI Model in software apps, agents, and services using an SSI Personal Data Usage Licensing (SSI-PDUL) Model approach. This includes software architects, application developers, and user experience (UX) specialists; as well as people involved in a broad range of standards efforts related to decentralized identity, verified credentials, and secure storage.
The work documented here was performed under the auspices of the Trusted Digital Web project in the Hyperonomy Digital Identity Lab of Parallelspace Corporation.

Hopefully, it’s not sacrilege to suggest something like the following might be useful: _any file formats for the secure export/import of Verified Credentials_?
…something like the file formats used for exporting/importing X.509 certificates (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509#Certificate_filename_extensions).

The scenario is bootstrapping an app with a copy of a VC for you as "Member" or "Citizen" of the app. The attributes would only be shared within the app on a traditional SSI selective disclosure basis ...so it the very initial use case where you're claiming an instance of a mobile or desktop as "your own" ...an identity bootstrapping process ...where you're not beholding to any issuer or service provider once the credential has been issued.  You can take it and present it to any app you want to.

I don't really see how that would work, as the credential wouldn't have any binding to the new identity you're creating. Maybe if it was self-issued at the onset.

Alice User would initially use an Issuer to get her Member or Citizen credential then she would persist it to some sort of secure, password protected file format like PKS12.

To run your own ledger you'd have to follow the indy setup rules (or you can start from https://github.com/bcgov/von-network and work your way up to running your own ledger)

not sure, in the docs somewhere but it is a bit disorganized.  Maybe someone else can show specifically.  von-network is probably the path of least resistance though.

That is typically an indication one or more nodes have not started correctly or the browser container has not connected to the nodes.  The latter can be a timing issue where the nodes have not completely initialized before the browser starts and tries to connect.

`./manage down` deleted that volumes.  `./manage stop` leaves them intact.  Start von-network.  Leave it for a bit.  It can take a minute or so for everything to initialize.  If, after a few minutes, it still says `loading`.  Use `./manage stop` , and then start it again.  Typically the nodes will come up faster and things will initialize in the right order.

pasting this from #general :
 What is the the most expedient means to get going with publishing a DID document to the ledger? I found this: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/README.md which seems to be a prerequsite for this https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Token-Test-Instructions.pdf . I hope I am not confusing hyperledger indy and sovrin though. Evernym built indy, sovrin uses it along with its governance. afaik.
I'd imagine new stuff is never easy. I think. Oh wow, this seems heavy. I'm dowloading 200MB of files, installing Rust, etc. Is there a docker image for everything or just for a local pool, or is a local pool all I need?
I imagine the answer is somewhere along the lines of: it depends.
If it helps, the machine I'm using is a beast (circa a few years ago). The pipe out of the net is small though.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 05 Feb 2021 00:51:33 GMT):<br/>
So -- some thoughts.  Indy does not support the DID spec, focuses mainly on verifiable credential exchange using AnonCreds, where only the Issuer of VCs needs to have a DID on the ledger.

To create a DID on a public ledger, you can use the Indy CLI to generate a DID and then go to https://selfserve.sovrin.org/ to publish it.  The same process occurs on Sovrin MainNet, but requires more legal overhead -- the governance.

To add more to the DID (such as an Endpoint), you can use the CLI.  However, most people are using Indy because they want an agent to issue, hold, prove or verify VCs.  For that, you would probably want to get into Aries.

In other words -- just creating a DID on a public ledger is not really "a thing" in Indy -- it's usually associated with VCs, and for VCs, there is a lot more moving parts.

Hope that helps get you to the next step...

Pasting from #general: 
Trying to run python tests on indy, but I get this error: FileNotFoundError: Could not find module 'indy.dll' (or one of its dependencies). Try using the full path with constructor syntax.
</p>
<p><strong>abuaesh</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 08:40:33 GMT):<br/>
Fixed it. The tests should be run from indy-sdk\libindy\tests path. Also the command to test is: cargo test -- --test-threads=1

hi everyone,
as the SSI ecosystem grows, we feel there is a growing need for a standardized wallet security ecosystem and therefore a working group called "Wallet Security" is to be launched under DIF umbrella.
In particular we think that:
- we should get a common understanding, terminology about wallet security in the community
- talk about wallet security architectures to analyze similarities
- create a specification and interface to communicate about wallet capabilities, security, regulation-conformance and other points of interoperability
- define mechanism to enable wallet security assertions, certification and ways to prove them
- define specifications about wallet user authentication, ways how to ensure them and how to communicate them to issuers/verifiers

If you are interested about this topic and like to comment, participate, criticize:
- please review the Wallet Security WG Charter: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18H2hVjHZEBjbnzod8tLogJIEzySdecbk9d-QBJaqHP0/edit
- subscribe to the mailing list: https://lists.identity.foundation/g/wallet-security

After gathering initial feedback, we will have an open discussion meeting soon.

I hope this is in the best interests of the community and will get the necessary feedback to make an impact.
Best regards,
Paul Bastian

Hello! Is it possible, in a scenario where, let's say that SSI (with Indy) was deployed on a country, for 2 people to have the same DID? In the Self Soverign Identity documents I've read from Indy and Sovrin, it's stated that a user can create as many DID's as it wants, and by studying the code a little, the creation of DID's is made offline, and if that DID needs to become public, it is made through the verynim steps described in the getting started. So, in my mind, it is possible for 2 distinct people to have credentials made for the same DID. Unlikely, but possible.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 11 Feb 2021 17:20:23 GMT):<br/>
Define possible?  :-). Bottom line is that it's not a concern and there is no need for centrally produced identifiers.  I would suggest you look into UUIDs -- the same principles apply.
</p>
<p><strong>mwherman2000</strong> (Thu, 11 Feb 2021 22:43:33 GMT):<br/>
When are Hyperledger Indy/Sovrin VCs better than Ethereum smart contracts for NFEs/NFTs (non-fungible entities/tokens)? It seems obvious but I don't have a detailed/worked out answer.  One project I'm associated with wants to use the ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard on Ethereum but I believe VCs are a better route to take. Part of the desire to stay on Ethereum is there is quite a vibrant NFT community on Ethereum and lots of different EC-721 tokens.  What are the considerations/decision points/knock-offs? ...off to do some Googling.
</p>
<p><strong>mwherman2000</strong> (Thu, 11 Feb 2021 22:46:04 GMT):<br/>
ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard on Ethereum:  https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721
</p>
<p><strong>abuaesh</strong> (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 06:39:06 GMT):<br/>
I believe you'd want to compare Indy with ERC725; the standard used for SSI on Ethereum. 

Here is what I missed after moving  from working Ethereum to work with Indy: A vibrant community that hardly lets you go to sleep with unanswered questions. A solid ground of documentation and plethora of resources. They have at least one article for every problem you may run into. 
Now, I can get stuck in a technical problem for days and feel invisible when I ask questions here.

I'm not sure if that's because I am using Windows(so not many people ran into the same problems), or because I am looking in the wrong places.
</p>
<p><strong>mwherman2000</strong> (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 07:17:12 GMT):<br/>
@abuaesh It's the other way around: I want to do NFT better on Indy (using VCs) than either ECR-721 or ECR-1155 on Ethereum.  Is this possible?  ...can I do the same or better on Indy? What are the pros and cons?

<p><strong>abuaesh</strong> (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 10:22:12 GMT):<br/>
Yes, it is possible, since you can write anything really in a VC. You may want to check Indy plenum for that: a general purpose DLT. Indy node is just an identity-related implementation of plenum. 
Will it be better? I don't know tbh. I am still trying to get something to work on Indy!

<p><strong>Lucampelli</strong> (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 12:24:17 GMT):<br/>
Well, can two distinct people have in their wallets two similar DID's? Let's say you and I, you graduated university, created a DID for your diploma, eg. DID 1234, I completed a cooking course, and also created a DID for receiving the certificate, eg. DID 1234.

I am using this doc to understand how the revocation works internally.
I dint understand quite clearly about revocation registery 
if these are 3 nos 3,5,7 prime nos that form accumulator then what i read from the docs tails file will have following structure array &accumulator value

Is this understanding correct?
now 3,5,7 corresponds to name id dob respectively now if this credential is revoked how this tails file will change &what prover sends  to verifier when creating proof.
can anyone please help me here

Hi  @abuaesh, It looks like we need some more details to be able to help you with this one.  Csn you tell us what kind of pool you are trying to connect to? (test pool, docker pool, von image, public existing ledger, etc.) Usually that error comes from networking problems, or an issue in the genesis file used to create the pool handle. :)

It has a fairly accessible description of how revocation works with tails files and the like.

Hi guys! I'm new to the hyperledger indy stuff and trying to implement a blockchain which can be used in the documentmanagement area (e.g. to varify signatures on documents in the document flow of a company). I started at 0 with Linux Foundation courses and tried to follow the Tutorials mentioned there. I got confused going through the docs. In some for example Python 3.5 is necessary in some a version higher than 3.5, in some you can run commands in your direct local environment in some a VM is necessary and even there a venv is sometimes recommended. I wondered if this is a must? are there any special requirements for using indy? or does it only vary because of the different tutorials and years they were published? Would be really great if someone could help me in the indy jungle :) Thanks

A DID is 32 characters long. Each character can be a digit or an alphabet letter->36 possibilities per character. A chance to generate a duplicate is one in a 32 power 36 chance.

Hi there T_anna, yes, it took me a while before I could pass the installation test for Indy. Are you using Windows?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 15:43:47 GMT):<br/>
do you have a tails server running?  

There is an implementation here: https://github.com/bcgov/indy-tails-server

It is trivial to run locally if you have docker -- clone the repo and then run `./manage start`
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 21:12:37 GMT):<br/>
"Versions must have at least 1 dot in them", but could contain as many as 2, according to Adam Burdett. The version string must look like a version, apparently. I looked for documentation to support it, but was unable to find it.  The error message, though confusing, strongly implies that is the case, though.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 21:39:35 GMT):<br/>
Easiest way to run in Indy is using von-network https://github.com/bcgov/von-network

Assuming you have docker/docker-compose/bash, you can be running a ledger in about 5 minutes.

</p>
<p><strong>RazaDen</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 09:10:47 GMT):<br/>
The tails server needs to have a "public IP", i.e., ACA-Py needs to be able to call it via its ip/domain name or w/e.
</p>
<p><strong>RazaDen</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 09:12:55 GMT):<br/>
Maybe that's the problem? Otherwise it's pretty straight forward. Let me give you an example where the tails server is configured to have a public endpoint, via ngrok:
`--tails-server-base-url https://5cd2c2e7cde6.ngrok.io`
This is for instance the parameter that we pass to one of our ACA-Py instances

<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 17:03:14 GMT):<br/>
in other words, change "version=1" to "version=1.0" and your code should work.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 17:42:53 GMT):<br/>
Are you able to get `von-network` up and running locally first?  To the point were you're able to open the ledger browser and register a DID through the interface?

Following this guide https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain-Identity/indy-ssivc-tutorial I get errors on my ubuntu 16.04 when trying to build the network saying "Error while fetching server API version". After googling this issue one suggestion was to follow another guide, since the IBM guide is archived. When following this https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/education/blob/master/LFS171x/indy-material/nodejs/README.md I get the following erros: "ERROR: for node4  Cannot start service node4: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint nodejs_node4_1 (2b46b52b453ef2b4edef405e993534d83a5a5a5d9b53aba2cfcf4435c8855f55): Bind for 0.0.0.0:9708 failed: port is already allocated

I'm also getting the info that python3.5 is outdated. This info is actually not true, since "python --version" returns Python 3.6.xx

Update: after resetting my docker containers i ran the command a second time, network came up, got the page where I can authenticate a new DID. Am I now done? Is this now a running von-network? Sorry for the dumb question, but since I got so many errors and different tutorials I am confused if this is it now..

<p><strong>abuaesh</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 21:25:47 GMT):<br/>
Yes! It works now--I mean giving a different reason for rejection:
"op":"REJECT","reason":"client request invalid: InvalidClientTaaAcceptanceError('Txn Author Agreement acceptance is required for ledger with id 1',)"}
</p>
<p><strong>abuaesh</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 21:26:33 GMT):<br/>
@lynn.bendixsen 
I am using an endorser did to send the request.

Trying to write a credential schema to the Sovrin Ledger, I get this response:
{"identifier":"N5woRhHcnE7BBh3FwsPqFJ","reason":"client request invalid: InvalidClientTaaAcceptanceError('Txn Author Agreement acceptance is required for ledger with id 1',)","op":"REJECT","reqId":1613724753152741900}

Here is the schema request I send:
{"reqId":1613724753152741900,"identifier":"N5woRhHcnE7BBh3FwsPqFJ","operation":{"type":"101","data":{"name":"Government_ID","version":"0.1","attr_names":["issuing_state","first_name","date_of_birth","date_of_issue","nationality","id","last_name","date_of_expiry","gender"]}},"protocolVersion":2}
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 19 Feb 2021 14:50:26 GMT):<br/>
That means you have `von-network` running properly.  Now you can try connecting the agent and see how far you get with what you were doing before.
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Fri, 19 Feb 2021 16:27:05 GMT):<br/>
You need to send the txn to the functions that add the TAA to the txn before sending it to a ledger that requires TAA.  I will see if I can find the docs or a code snippet to help.

Hello folks,
on March 1st, 6pm CET we will have an open call to kickoff the upcoming Wallet Security WG at DIF.
I will present motivation, goals and a first roadmap.
Very short summary:
 - standardized wallet security is necessary for sensitive credentials like id-cards, payment credentials or more
 - create a specification and interface to communicate about wallet capabilities, security, regulation-conformance and other points of security-relevant interoperability
 - define mechanism to enable wallet security assertions, certification and ways to prove them
 - define specifications about wallet user authentication, ways how to ensure them and how to communicate them to issuers/verifiers


WG Charter:https://docs.google.com/document/d/18H2hVjHZEBjbnzod8tLogJIEzySdecbk9d-QBJaqHP0/edit
Mailing list: https://lists.identity.foundation/g/wallet-security

Topic: Wallet Security WG Kickoff
Time: Mar 1, 2021 06:00 PM Amsterdam, Berlin, Rome, Stockholm, Vienna

Thanks Lynn. I found these 2 links talking about the TAA:
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/requests.md#transaction_author_agreement
and
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/requests.md#common-write-request-structure

But they don't really mention how to call the function doing this.

Hi everyone,     I am trying out revocation with von tails server. For demonstration purposes i am using current nodejs revocation sample which uses tails file stored locally in .indy-client folder 
I am referring this readme file https://github.com/bcgov/indy-tails-server. i have deployed this server with docker I ran nodejs revocation sample (not deleting wallet) sample failed to revoke credential. So to test server i tried sending PUT request to von server but i am getting Revocation registry ID is not valid:GcjVZQ...

Can anyone please help me here?

Just figured that the timestamp  shouldn't be the exact current time of accepting the TAA, to reduce corratability risk. So, the timestamp should be the time of the start of the day of accepting the TAA.

More about it here: https://sovrin.org/preparing-for-the-sovrin-transaction-author-agreement/ 
"Similarly, the application should not provide the time the user accepts, but only the day. Correlation risk can be further reduced by tracking a different acceptance date per DID on the ledger, or regularly asking the user to reaccept the agreement in order to change the acceptance date—although we acknowledge these approaches may increase the user’s friction when writing to the ledger."

How do we know that the credential offer goes ONLY to the designated person. What if the offer(or a copy of it) falls in the wrong hands? They will still be able to generate a credential request, and get issued the credential(unless if the issuer keeps a list somewhere of DIDs that are legible to this offer). Is there something I am missing in the steps because I can't find something that links the offer to its targeted recipient.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 23 Feb 2021 18:50:04 GMT):<br/>
The "best practices" in that is that you establish a DIDComm connection with an entity, and then use that channel to get some sort of proof of who they are.  If possible, you would use the channel to do a proof request.  With that done, binding the channel to the proof, you would use the same channel to issue the credential via the offer-request-issue sequence in the issue-credential protocol.

Note as well that with AnonCreds (assuming you are using that), in the Offer and Request there are crypto graphic elements that bind the two parties to the credential.  So when you issue the credential to the entity, you are binding it to that entity, and they will be the only one that can present the credential.

That's not the role of Indy. You don't want to put data about individuals, even identifiers and public keys on any blockchain. What you can do with Indy is issue a verifiable credential to every citizen that allows them to prove their National ID without any need to have verifiers integrating with the National ID service. The identifier does not need to be given to the verifiers for many (most?) use cases -- they just need to know the the person is a citizen or resident.

Hi everyone, I was reading indy-plenum doc  and I didn't get what these statements saying "Client-to-node and node-to-node communication happens on CurveZMQ. The codebase has an abstraction called Stack that manages communication. It has several variants which offer different features."  I understand that messages are send back and forth by  peers' corresponding transient public keys  obtained using curvezmq and are generated by curve-keygen. But what does following statement is saying "codebase has an abstraction called Stack that manages communication". What Stack stands for in this context and how it manages the communication? Can you please someone eleborate this statement so that I can make more sense.

Hello! Are issued credentials stored also in the issuer's wallet? I mean, let's say Faber University Issued a Graduated Credential for me, will it also be stored in it's wallet? Or it depends on the implementation?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 02 Mar 2021 19:25:20 GMT):<br/>
Depends on the implementation.  In ACA-Py, there are three options for issued credential exchange record (which would contain the info in the credential).  (1) Delete the record entirely, (2) keep the full exchange record in the wallet, (3) keep a minimal record that just contains just enough about the issuance to be able to revoke it using the ID of the record.  

Regardless, it is up to the controller to, for example, link the credential exchange ID to the entity your system that represents the holder.  For example, Faber would keep in it's system the ID of the student and (at least) the ID the Credential Exchange ID so that if it needs to revoke the credential for the student it can find the information necessary to do so.

Sorry for the delay in respsonding.  Have you read this document -- particular the part about the "interval" meaning in the proof, and the interval meaning in the query to the ledger?  The differences between those create a lot of confusion and may be what you are seeing here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0011-cred-revocation
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 03 Mar 2021 15:30:18 GMT):<br/>
Basically, to create the proof of non-revocation, you have to have all of the deltas from ledger -- you have to know all of the inactive and revoked credentials so a witness can be constructed. If you don't get all of those, you can't make the proof.
</p>
<p><strong>vineeta</strong> (Wed, 03 Mar 2021 15:53:06 GMT):<br/>
yes I had checked this document  wherein verifier sents the interval in non-revoked field but it doesnt explain 
about verification process. I had tried a scenario where proof is created by prover using now() as current timestamp
for fetching delta (similar to what is done in indy-sdk samples/nodejs/revocationScenario) & at verifier this revReg object is created using timestamp from identifier as key 
So not clear on this part what does that timestamp mean. In this example delta is fetched based on current timestamp but timestamp key is from identifiers(timestampOfProof)

Hi everyone, Is there a way to configure tails server url in revocation registry definition using indy-sdk. tails-location takes file system location by default.
We were  able to add location using Aries but can't figure out how to do it with indy SDK. Can anyone please help here
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Wed, 03 Mar 2021 18:23:44 GMT):<br/>
I don't think the SDK provides a method to do that. Currently you have to manually edit the JSON of the revocation registry definition
</p>
<p><strong>vineeta</strong> (Wed, 03 Mar 2021 18:35:23 GMT):<br/>
Yes. You can update revRegDef['value']['tailsLocation'] before building request here. indy.buildRevocRegDefRequest(did, revRegDef);

Indy blockchain is a public permissioned blockchain, is it true that everyone can read the data on the blockchain without authentication or authorization ?

The Identity Implementer's WG is meeting on Thursday (Mar 11th @ 9am MT / 4pm UTC).  In this call, we will review updates from several industry WGs, which you may have missed this week.

Renata Toktar (Evernym) will give a presentation / demo on a new process called "ledger freeze" and how that works with Indy ledgers.

Here are links to the Wiki and Zoom meeting:

Hi Guys, I have a few questions about indy. if someone can help would be great. How can you connect your indy node to sovrin network? if yes, will sovrin charge for connectivity?
If I will issue a credential using evernym, will I be able to load that credential in any wallet like Trinsic ?
What would you recommend in terms of building applications - indy connected to sovrin, trinsic or evernym ?
If i will spin my own network of indy, are there any wallets that will work automatically with it?

Hi everyone, although it is widely agreed that we don’t put personal data of individuals on Indy, in case someone ends up putting personal data either accidentally or maliciously, is there a workaround to somehow take care of it? 
Also, can “Right to be forgotten” be somehow managed while using Indy?

<p><strong>deas</strong> (Mon, 22 Mar 2021 16:59:38 GMT):<br/>
I'd _really_ try to avoid a scenario where that's possible, personally. What are you using Indy for that enables someone to write personal data to the chain?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 22 Mar 2021 17:25:20 GMT):<br/>
On Sovrin, there is an agreement with an Endorser and with an Author that explicitly excludes writing personal data to the ledger as a way to avoid the need for that.  The only potential PII that could go Indy is an identifier (with nothing about that identifier controller/subject), and on Sovrin, only business entities where such an identifier is NOT personal are (legally) allowed to write to the ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 22 Mar 2021 17:26:04 GMT):<br/>
If those agreements are followed, there is no PII on the ledger, and not a need to be forgotten.

@swcurran I agree that because of the legal agreement a business entity will not be writing any personal data on the ledger since that could have legal consequences. But in case of accidental writes, is there anything that could be done on the ledger?
</p>
<p><strong>HighBrow</strong> (Tue, 23 Mar 2021 07:00:27 GMT):<br/>
@deas I’m not enabling someone to write personal data on the chain. I am talking about the case when some personal data could actually land up on the ledger since as of now there are only legal implications that would discourage that to happen in the first place.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 23 Mar 2021 13:51:43 GMT):<br/>
Correct.  There has been a plan defined to "tombstone" data -- make it inaccessible from the network, but that has not been implemented.  This link was posted to the feature overview:

The Identity Implementer's WG is meeting tomorrow (Mar 25th @ 9am MT / 3pm UTC).  In this call, we will review updates from several industry WGs, which you may have missed this week.

Steve McCown (Anonyome Labs) will give a presentation on how to simplify creating language wrappers for Rust libraries to more easily support multiple platforms.

Here are links to the Wiki and Zoom meeting:

Not sure which channel would be best for this question. I was attempting to stand up a DID resolver on Openshift 4. (Note that I am abandoning this and waiting on resolver being included in act-py; however, if there is an easy answer, that'd be great). This appears to be one of the many issues related to openshift and the image user accounts, but hoping I can get pointed to something more concrete that I can address. I know the files for my genesis transactions are on the image and in the location specified by my config.  I have built and run the same image outside of Openshift and it works.  But this is my error stack: ```m[33m[qtp1262822392-12] WARN servlet.ResolveServlet (doGet) -[m [31mDriver reported for did:sov:WRfXPg8dantKVubE3HX8pw: Cannot create pool config "_": org.hyperledger.indy.sdk.IOException: An IO error occurred.

<p><strong>CryptoMuck</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 12:46:50 GMT):<br/>
Hello all, 
while studying the Indy project I wondered if there is some kind of verifiable encryption implemented or if there are plans to implement it? So that for instance it would be possible for a prover to encrypt an identifying attribute from a credential in form of ZKP under the usage of a public key from a third party, so that this third party could decrypt the attribute in case of (proven) misbehaviour by the prover and identify him. Thank you!
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 14:21:32 GMT):<br/>
At this point -- no plans for that.  The prover can put self-asserted claims into a presentation, so in theory, I think that could work.
</p>
<p><strong>CryptoMuck</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 16:10:06 GMT):<br/>
Thank you very much. Are accepted proofs currently stored by the verifier in some form?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 18:22:53 GMT):<br/>
That's up to the verifier -- and the regulations under which they operate. Minimizing what the verifier holds can reduce their liability.

<p><strong>deas</strong> (Tue, 20 Apr 2021 12:44:46 GMT):<br/>
@waqaswahid1 I'm not an Indy expert, but I'm pretty sure that's not really what Indy is for. The beauty of Indy is that none of the private information is stored on chain; all of the private data moves between (Aries) agents in an encrypted peer-to-peer fashion following the DIDcomm protocols. All that's stored on chain is the sets of the definitions and public identities needed to enable the verifiability of proof presentations made in those subsequent peer to peer transactions.

Out of curiosity, what would be the goal of making user data into NFTs?
</p>
<p><strong>waqaswahid1</strong> (Fri, 23 Apr 2021 10:01:43 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=S9vha3tSfoXbxZCiL) goal of making user data into NFTs is that user have the power to sell their personal data as an NFT to the companies.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=S9vha3tSfoXbxZCiL) to give power to the users to sell their personal on their own. but it is only possible when user data will be fully private and decentralized.

The Identity Implementer's WG is meeting tomorrow (May 6th @ 9am MT / 3pm UTC). In this call, we will review updates from several industry WGs, which you may have missed this week.

This week, James Ebert (Indicio) will be giving a presention on the new Aires Bifold project.

how to make DID of the user data which include the name, email, age, id no, and many other attributes? The DID should be accessible outside the world.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 10 May 2021 17:52:36 GMT):<br/>
The following was posted by the W3C DID Working Group. Does anyone (e.g. @brentzundel  @peacekeeper  @drummondreed ) exactly what is needed here?  I tried to understand it, but it is not obvious to me  what is supposed to be in the DID Method document, and what testing is done.

```
The W3C DID Working Group achieved another milestone last week; all tests for the specification are now complete.

This means that we are ready for DID Method implementers to submit their DID Method implementations for conformance testing against the specification.

The deadline for submitting DID Method implementations is in two weeks (by May 25th, 2021).

The instructions on how to submit a DID Method implementation can be found here:

https://github.com/w3c/did-test-suite/#adding-your-did-implementation

If you are a DID Method implementer, please get your DID Method implementations submitted in the next two weeks.

Hello, is there any way with which we can get the private key associated with a DID in Indy. indy_create_and_store_my_did Function creates and stored the keys in the wallet and with KeyForDidAsync function we can get the verification key for the specified DID but this does not return the private key.  so is it possible to Fetch the private key associated with the DID?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 14 May 2021 15:10:05 GMT):<br/>
In Indy, use of the private key is embedded within Indy library calls, and the private key does not get exposed outside of those calls. I think there is even code that clears the memory where the private key was used to prevent it getting out.

So, the basic answer is -- you can't.  It's stored in encrypted storage, accessed by the routines that need to use it, and unavailable anywhere else.

The short answer is that nothing has been done to my knowledge. All the pieces exist in the ledger, but someone would need to write an observer client to pull the transactions without engaging in consensus.

why is there three revocations IDs for one credential definition?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 18:17:53 GMT):<br/>
Not sure what you mean by 3.  There are two objects -- RevReg_Def and RevReg_Entry.

The RevReg_Def is the metadata about the RevReg -- size, use type, ID, etc.

RevReg_Entry -- are the updates to the RevReg as credentials are revoked -- the list of index values in the tails file that are revoked and the new accumulator for the entry.

<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 19:00:57 GMT):<br/>
when i am creating a revocation reg for a given cred def, it is producing 3 different rev reg ids
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 19:01:03 GMT):<br/>
Is that using ACA-Py?
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 19:01:06 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 19:01:06 GMT):<br/>
yes, it uses ACA-Py
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 19:03:42 GMT):<br/>
the interesting fact is that when I created the rev reg id it gave me a different id and when I issued a credential, it attached the an other id, both were out of the three displayed, but the point is how to identify which id was used in the credential as the issue credential outputs don't carry rev reg info
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 19:04:40 GMT):<br/>
I am using the bcgov indy-tails-server as well
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 19:04:56 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure about the three, but ACA-Py creates an extra RevReg so that there is never a need to stop issuing to create a RevReg (which can take awhile).

When ACA-Py includes revocation on a Cred Def, it automatically creates two registries.  Then it activates one, and uses it until it is all used up.  When the first is full, it switches to the second one, and makes a third one in the background.  That continues as needed.

An issue is never delayed to make a RevReg.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 19:05:26 GMT):<br/>
So, it's not an Indy thing, it's done at the ACA-Py level.
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 19:06:23 GMT):<br/>
ohh ok, but then how do we know which one has been used for which cred, when we are an endorser
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 19:07:34 GMT):<br/>
When issuing, the "issue credential" process should be returning the id of the credential and it's revreg -- you have to know both to revoke.

As well, if you keep the credential exchange record around in the issuer, both pieces of data are in that, and I believe (could be wrong...) that you can supply that when revoking, and the data will be automagically pulled from that record to do the revocation.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 19:08:26 GMT):<br/>
I'm confused on the three IDs that you first had (unless you have done a bunch of issuing).
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 19:08:37 GMT):<br/>
thats my whole issue, `issue-credential` endpooints are not giving me the rev_reg_id back
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 19:09:39 GMT):<br/>
Hmmm....  need people with more knowledge here -- hands on in the code.

@esune , could you please weigh in here?

<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 19:14:17 GMT):<br/>
this is the output of the /issue-credential/send API
</p>
<p><strong>sauveergoel</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 19:14:33 GMT):<br/>
it doesnot provide with rev_reg_id
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 25 May 2021 20:56:39 GMT):<br/>
Looks like it is still in the "Offer_sent" state -- which makes sense for the response to the API call -- it's an asynch operation to issue a credential.  There should be a webhook come back to the controller when the credential itself has been issued.

Also, you can query the credential exchange records and then look at the one for the issuance (assuming it has not been deleted).

As @swcurran stated, normally you would get `revocation_id` and `revoc_reg_id` as part of the response. Not sure whether they will show up if the state is prior to `issued`, as they might not have been written yet (I am not sure about this, but it is possible).

I would first make sure you can complete the flow and reach the `credential_issued` state on the credential exchange, and dig deeper afterwards.

FYI - Arnaud (Chair of the Hyperledger TSC) requested a "top story" about each Hyperledger project.  I've sent this in for Indy:

```
The top story in the Hyperledger Indy community this year has been the deployment of new public instances of Indy. While the most active and best known instance of Indy, Sovrin's Mainnet, continues to operate smoothly, a new global ledger was deployed by Indicio.tech, and the IDUnion group deployed their network in the European Union. The expansion of networks has triggered efforts to create a new DID Method for Indy (called "did:indy") to enable resolving Indy identifiers across all public Indy networks.
```

Feel free to provide feedback -- we can adjust as needed before the Hyperledger Global Forum.

Not that I'm aware of.  There many ledgers that store DIDs (90-odd last check?), and many Indy ledger instances. But no ledgers that store the same objects as Indy, but using a different underlying blockchain.

Hi all, I have a question regarding credential unlinkability. Based on the contents of a proof, a verifier cannot track which credentials are used to create the proof, I understand that. But if a prover wants to present a proof unlinkably multiple times to the same verifier, then it has to establish a new connection with the verifier for each presentation, correct? And I assume that on network level it must also be ensured that the individual presentations cannot be linked to each other (e.g. by changing IPs of the prover). Have I got all this right?

<p><strong>brentzundel</strong> (Wed, 02 Jun 2021 17:00:16 GMT):<br/>
Indy relies on state proofs for verification of read requests. This allows (currently) a read transaction to be answered by a single validator node, rather than requiring the read request to go through multiple validators. The same proof would allow for an observer node to be trusted.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 16:39:34 GMT):<br/>
A little more detail -- to make sure that the transaction is valid, a client could query each validator node, compare the answers and decide if it is correct.  The state proof is signed by multiple validators (I believe (T - 1)/3 nodes where T is the total number of nodes) so that a client only has to ask one validator node, get back the state proof and verifiy it.

There are several things that are not quite right here.  From the proof, the verifier can tell what credentials the claims come from -- they have to know that to know who issued the credential and to verify the signatures on the data.

`But if a prover (AMA) wants to present a proof unlinkably multiple times to the same verifier (ACA Py), then it has to establish a new connection with the verifier for each presentation, correct?`

That's correct -- a person/entity could do that. Would be like signing up for a website using different email addresses.

Linking via IP address might be possible - depends on how the message travelled from prover to verifier. With DIDComm, that could be multiple hops.

Hi, I've been working with indy for a while and I notice kind of inconsistency in pool genesis format. I mean that, some versions have the pool_genesis content in where services port numbering is defined as string and others as integer. The problem arises when you try to load one of those files to connect to the pool, because you will get a common invalid state error message. For example: the sandox pool genesis (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/stable/sovrin/pool_transactions_sandbox_genesis) has ports encoded as string, while built-in development pool included in indy-sdk repo, has them defined as integers (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/samples/nodejs/src/util.js). So, what is the correct data type for this field?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 04 Jun 2021 15:06:56 GMT):<br/>
Interesting.  Thoughts @andrew.whitehead  @dbluhm

I'll check with Lynn Bendixsen; he manages our Indy networks at Indicio and was also a major player in the Sovrin networks
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Fri, 04 Jun 2021 17:04:51 GMT):<br/>
All of the public networks that I have created genesis files for use strings for the ports, so I would assume that strings is the correct format.  
To create my genesis files I  use: https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/steward-tools/tree/master/create_genesis and I have some step-by-step instructions to help with running that script:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HXG6WOl_3K7k63CNdYEiTk1Y3eMiwLuhr5uTHg3RaoY
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 04 Jun 2021 18:11:39 GMT):<br/>
Presumably indy-sdk accepts both.  @andrew.whitehead -- can you confirm that indy-vdr does as well?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 04 Jun 2021 18:57:27 GMT):<br/>
It looks like client_port and node_port should both accept a string or number
</p>
<p><strong>sergio.anguita</strong> (Mon, 07 Jun 2021 08:35:19 GMT):<br/>
Im working on type safe application and needed to know the correct data type, just to avoid extra code for handling both datatypes. For what you said, using String is the most desirable way, am I right?

As I asked in #aries, can Indy manage something like "data DID" (or document DID)?  I heard that ACA-py can't handle such concepts, is that also the case in Indy? In this case, "manage" means issuing a DID Document with data as the subject, controller as the data manager (person), etc.

Some people have mentioned using Indy as a document management system. Have you done anything like this?

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 15 Jun 2021 13:41:06 GMT):<br/>
The ACA-Py answer was based on capabilities of Indy -- not for Aries/ACA-Py per se.  Indy is only used for storing specific data related to the issuing of verifiable credentials.  It is not for storing arbitrary documents, and does not support doing so.  Currently, the DIDDoc returned from resolving an Indy DID is constrained to a very limited format.

Hi all, I had a question about the quintessential zero-knowledge proof example of Alice proving that she is over 18 without revealing her DOB - given that current Indy predicates only work on int32s, what is the best way to represent dates in a credential such that they work for predicate proofs?
I had one idea: at first I was trying to go with an approach of number of days since a certain epoch and being able to use common datetime functions to do the calculations, but it seemed rather complicated and there were a lot of subtle issues around timezones, leap seconds, which epoch to choose, etc. The approach I would like to propose is to apply simple modular arithmetic to map a date to an int of the form YYYYMMDD. This would allow easy conversion to int and back to date without any confusion that would result from using time libraries. The only gotchas I can see are that you couldn't represent dates before AD (which seems ok, or they could be negative which also seems ok), and that you'd need to have some error handling if somehow a credential was ever submitted with an invalid mapping eg 20201332 (13th month, 32nd day, etc) - although some error handling on credential issuing should address that. To construct the proof the verifier would just convert today's date minus 18 years to int form, and then check that the int-date DOB on the credential is < that.
What do people think? Ideally I'd like to use a standard date convention so if there's not already one, I could add a proposal to https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0074-didcomm-best-practices/README.md#date-time-conventions (or create a new RFC)

(And I should specify that 32 bit unixtime wouldn't work, as we want to include dates outside of 1901-2038)

dates can also considered as numeric values using epoch format, which is more standarized way to figure out if a value is bigger or less than certain threshold. In that way, the epoch is truncated to int32 size to make the calculations. Does this fit for your needs?

<p><strong>jacobsaur</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 16:45:32 GMT):<br/>
I believe the epoch format for unix timestamps can only cover dates between 1901-2038 (unless you're referring to another format), and we need to be able to handle dates outside that range (eg 30-year mortgages in the future, land titles in the past, etc).

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 17:27:13 GMT):<br/>
I would love to see this.  A couple of interesting challenges to throw into this:

- It would be nice to be able to do this via a convention so that it can be used with minimal/no changes to Indy AnonCreds and the indy-sdk.
- If you switch to epoch for the raw data, the format becomes ugly for display, such as in the wallet.  It could lead to needing both an epoch date and a "human" date attribute.

Would it work to have a convention of the field name and data format? For example, the name of the attribute must end in "DT" and the data element must be an ISO date format.  Alternatively, perhaps it is sufficient that the string format being an ISO Date is sufficient.

If you do that, then the encoded value can be an integer date, and the proof request predicate could assume it is a date.

The encoding would then have to be formalized in an RFC, so that all participants were aware of it.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 17:30:16 GMT):<br/>
This would extend that to include some "format-sniffing" to decide if something is a date and then encoding it as appropriate.
</p>
<p><strong>jacobsaur</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 21:57:32 GMT):<br/>
Would the approach I suggested of mapping to an int in the form YYYYMMDD address most of these issues - ie it doesn't require changes to Indy AnonCreds and it's more or less human readable? Granted some UIs will still probably want to format it into a date format appropriate for their locale but at least you can tell what date it is by looking at it.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 24 Jun 2021 22:20:56 GMT):<br/>
Doh...I misread what you wrote and was making it more complicated. 

That's a great idea and it does solve the human readable problem -- nice!

Hi everyone,
I have a question about indy node performance. When we perform a load test with indy java wrapper, the tps values we get are very low (for example, the tps value for nym request is around 50-60)
and when we monitor,we saw that java threads are waiting on submit request step. Does anyone have a similar load test and get different values?
Or if you can get much higher tps values, what would you suggest to check? Not only write request but also read request is giving similar tps results.
We made our test in our private network ( which 4 nodes on same machine different docker containers and machine resources 40 GB ram,30 CPU, 105 GB storage.)

I was thinking it should go in either or both of https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0441-present-proof-best-practices and this https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0592-indy-attachments

In a quick scan of 0592, I don't see the "verifying claims" section that was in 0037 (link from my earlier comment), so I think we should add that in, and include this idea there and in the examples.  As well, we need the caveat of this not handling time zones and all that stuff, so the test is accurate to +/- 24 hours.

I think we should verify the process and document it so that people have a clear example of "To prove a person is over 21, do the following" covering the attribute in the schema, the credential data and the proof request. 

The RFC you mentioned is a general one about DIDComm messages, not about VCs, so I recommend NOT adding it there.  We need to focus on clarifying the handling of this for Indy AnonCreds.

I've submitted a PR here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/687
The only thing that seems a little bit off is that the RFC is focused on  proof presentations, while this also has a component about how the issuer should represent dates in their issued credentials (but it's in the service of eventually creating a proof).
Comments welcome!

Hello Everyone, 

I am trying to run Von network on the AWS instance. On executing "./manage start" I am able to run it. Even with AWS instance's public address I am able to see the VON Dashboard and when I do <public address>/genesis , I am able to see genesis file where client port IP and node port IP as AWS Instance's private address instead of public address. 

How can I get public IP instead of private IP in my Genesis file? 

I tried to give external genesis file which has client IP and Node IP as my AWS Instance's public address but, I am getting error "Error initializing pool ledger " on VON Dashboard. Could anyone please guide me here?

Step 5:
```
# This command requires the publicly accessible ip address of the machine `public_ip_address`
# WEB_SERVER_HOST_PORT maps the docker service port to a public port on the machine
# LEDGER_INSTANCE_NAME sets the display name of the ledger on the page headers.
./manage start public_ip_address WEB_SERVER_HOST_PORT=80 "LEDGER_INSTANCE_NAME=My Ledger"
```

Thanks for the response. 

I tried this method as well, I am not getting any pool initialization error but *I was still getting private IP in client IP and node IP my genesis file.* 

This private IP in genesis File causing issue when I am passing ledger URL(AWS instance's public URL) in Aries Agent to start up.   

Could you please guide me here?

Hi,

  It's possible to query from indy-cli for all schemas in a DOMAIN ledger? like in VON Ledger Browser filtering by txn_type=101.
  Many thanks.

No.  There are no query mechanisms on Indy.  VON Ledger browser and IndyScan query one by one through all the ledger objects, creates a database and use that to do queries like the one you want to do.

Sorry for newb question. I have stucked here for days. I even tried to search on past messages but I still unable to get indy-cli working on MacOS Big Sur. I am using .zshrc to set up the environment path but zsh still returns command not found.

Here's how my .zshrc looks like 
`export LIBRARY_PATH=~/Users/capuchin/SDK/indy/libindy_1.16.0/lib/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/Users/capuchin/SDK/indy/libindy_1.16.0/lib/
export LIBINDY_DIR=~/Users/capuchin/SDK/indy/libindy_1.16.0/lib/`

Can someone point to me what did I do wrong? and also runnin indy-cli executable file returns 

`capuchin@macintosh ~ % /Users/capuchin/SDK/indy/indy-cli ; exit;
dyld: Library not loaded: /Users/jenkins/workspace/indy-sdk_indy-sdk-cd_rc/libindy/target/release/deps/libindy.dylib
  Referenced from: /Users/capuchin/SDK/indy/indy-cli
  Reason: image not found
zsh: abort      /Users/capuchin/SDK/indy/indy-cli`
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 07 Jul 2021 14:06:24 GMT):<br/>
Looks like you're using absolute paths, so you shouldn't include the `~` prefix
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 07 Jul 2021 14:07:34 GMT):<br/>
... also rather than updating your `PATH` env variables try creating links to the `/usr/local/lib` directory (which is searched by default)
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Wed, 07 Jul 2021 14:08:39 GMT):<br/>
e.g. `ln -s /Users/capuchin/SDK/indy/libindy_1.16.0/lib/somefile.dylib /usr/local/lib/somefile.dylib`

Hey all, I am trying to locally run von network and aries cloud agents. So to begin with, I am using sovrin network - stagging network genesis block to start the von network locally. Now when I start the aries-cloud-agent with the local LEDGER_URL and it gives me TAA error while creating schema. The did is registered on the sovrin staging network using `https://selfserve.sovrin.org/nym`. Not sure why I am still facing the TAA error since von network code was recently updated to incorporate those changes. 
Anyone has any idea about this?

It sounds like you're connecting to Sovrin StagingNet and not a `von-network` ledger instance.  From what I can gather you're setting up `von-network` as a ledger browser for Sovrin StagingNet.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 13 Jul 2021 12:06:23 GMT):<br/>
What's the error you are getting regarding the TAA?  When a TAA is enforced on a network you need to accept the agreement using one of the accepted options.

to:

Hi all, 
we are working as Consortialpartner in the project IDunoin and in future also in the project EBSI. 
In context of education, we want to „pimp“ the schema definition (and credential defintion) to have a full High School Diploma (Abiturzeugnis) as verifiable credential.
Is there a way to modify the existing schema such as: 

from:
`
  "attrNames": ["age", "sex", "height", "name"]

For indy credentials not really. Indy creds are just lists of attributes. So as soon as you want to define an array with an unspecified size (as your example suggests) you have a problem.
</p>
<p><strong>PatrickHerbke-TUBerlin</strong> (Wed, 14 Jul 2021 10:00:51 GMT):<br/>
is there a more detailed documentation somewhere than https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/sdk/en/latest/docs/how-tos/save-schema-and-cred-def/README.html?
Would our approach (array lists) generally not work or can code passages be adapted to implement this?
</p>
<p><strong>PatrickHerbke-TUBerlin</strong> (Wed, 14 Jul 2021 10:04:03 GMT):<br/>
The current schema restrictions wouldn't allow any more complex certification, such as high school diploma (Abiturzeugnis). We don't want to store just signed pdf files in our wallet solution...do you have a tip, which solutions would offer themselves for it?
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Wed, 14 Jul 2021 10:09:38 GMT):<br/>
Currently you could either (1) Prepare a schema/creddef that supports a fixed number of arrays items and make them explicit attributes0.degree.type ..., but this makes proof requests pretty ugly.
(2) have the whole attributes block as one stringified attribute, but then you have to disclose the whole block
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Wed, 14 Jul 2021 10:10:36 GMT):<br/>
The main issue is that a credential definition includes cryptographic matterial per attribute. Hence, the number of attributes is fixed
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Wed, 14 Jul 2021 10:11:32 GMT):<br/>
There was work in Rich Schemas, but it's more likely that we switch to W3C Credentials with BBS+ Signatures
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Wed, 14 Jul 2021 10:11:32 GMT):<br/>
There was work on Rich Schemas, but it's more likely that the community switches to W3C Credentials with BBS+ Signatures to support such use cases
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 14 Jul 2021 10:17:09 GMT):<br/>
Note that such use cases with BBS+ are going to "fun".  While you can have an arbitrary length array, for selective disclosure, all of the attributes become a list, and you pick the elements of the list to disclose. Thus, to expose an entry (set of values) in the array, you will have to determine the indices in the list for those items.  That said, a user interface can be constructed for the Holder to make the selection of the values in they array they want to disclose and then have the code calculate the list indices needed.

Another approach would be to issue individual credentials for each array item :)
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 14 Jul 2021 10:19:13 GMT):<br/>
And interestingly, I just raised a PR to the "issue-credential" RFC to support such a use case -- issuing multiple credentials with an instance of the protocol :-). https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/pull/692

Hello! two quick questions: Are the Hyperledger Indy's credentials actually Smart Contracts, or does Indy actually use Smart Contracts?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 14 Jul 2021 18:58:49 GMT):<br/>
No and No.  Indy credentials do not go on a ledger.  Only public keys for signing / verifying credentials,  credential schema metadata, and revocation data go on the ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>Lucampelli</strong> (Wed, 14 Jul 2021 19:01:20 GMT):<br/>
Nice, thank you! One last question: In a setting where a university needs a credential in order to be valid for issuing a diploma. If the university's credencial were to be revoked, and the university ceased function, how to check if the university was "valid" by the time the diploma was sent, if it is needed to obtain the proof from the university in order to check that?
</p>
<p><strong>Lucampelli</strong> (Wed, 14 Jul 2021 19:02:22 GMT):<br/>
I'd say maybe the university generates and sends the proof, together with the diploma credencial... what do you think?
</p>
<p><strong>Lucampelli</strong> (Wed, 14 Jul 2021 19:03:01 GMT):<br/>
This way the student would be able to send that proof with the diploma proof, and someone would be able to check both right?

There has been some talk of that -- being able to include a proof within a credential.  The RFC 104 chained credential talks about that use case.  https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0104-chained-credentials

That said, I'm not aware of an implementation of this.  Would love to see it as it could add a lot of interesting capabilities, including the one you mention.

While following this tutorial. We are sucessfully able to set up a static indy pool, but we want to add nodes dynamically as given in this document. But, if our node is on a different EC2 instance, how can we give the access of genesis file as it doesn't exist on this new instance?

The genesis file is a static document once established, and so can be put in an accessible place.  For example, the Sovrin network genesis files are on GitHub.

Hi Team,
I have setup indy nodes on multi host.2 indy nodes on host1 and 2 indy nodes on host2.
How I can add New nodes into this environement.How i can use genesis_url.Also can i remove nodes from this network?
Thanks in advance !!

To add to this question, is there a specific procedure to be followed for adding new nodes from a host different from host 1 and host 2? When trying to do so while following https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/node/en/latest/add-node.html
my node crashes
</p>
<p><strong>Shweta1</strong> (Mon, 19 Jul 2021 12:09:02 GMT):<br/>
what error you are getting?

<p><strong>chhokra</strong> (Mon, 19 Jul 2021 12:11:45 GMT):<br/>
The error log on my third host shows the following messages 
"Node3 found the following missing connections : Node2,Node1.

The node is not ready yet so view change will not be proposed now, but rescheduled"

1- Holder privacy
2- Max revocation proof size 4KB
3- Max computation time 1s
4- Single network request to become up-to-date

In finishing the revocation proposal for anoncreds 2.0 I want to make sure I didn't miss anything

Hello Team, 

We are trying to create an indy-network where we are facing issue adding a node into an existing pool. 

So far our network setup is working for "Remote Test Network" but when trying to add another node from different aws instance then getting error as mentioned below. 

We are following Hyperledger indy documentation "https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/node/en/latest/add-node.html#node-preparation"

Could someone please guide us here?

Hello Team,
We are developing edge agent for android. We are using libindy library for android taken from " https://repo.sovrin.org/android/libindy/stable/1.16.0/".
When we try to store the credentials using indy_prover_store_credential, we see the following error- "indyorg.hyperledger.indy.sdk.InvalidStructureException: A value being processed is not valid."

Please note that we have ensured the following:
1. we are passing valid JSON string values for all the input params. For "rev_reg_def_json" we passed null.
2. ensured the JSON strings carry the value null instead of "null", wherever applicable.

Any pointers to how we can find out which param may be causing the issue? The library does not specify that in the error.

We tried to build the libindy for android by adding few logs. But we could not successfully compile it. The 'cargo build' is successful but the 'build-libindy-android.sh' is failing with error - "can't open file 'build/tools/make_standalone_toolchain.py' :[Errno 2] No such file or directory?"

We are building on ubuntu 20.0.4.

Did anyone face this issue or knows what could be the issue?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 20 Jul 2021 12:29:23 GMT):<br/>
A few things to look at:
- Indy-node uses ports 9700-9799.  I see 8701 and 8702 in your screenshot.
- There is a distinct difference between internal and external client and node IP:Port addresses, especially on AWS.  When initializing the node you need to use the internal addresses and ports.  When registering the node on the network with `ledger node` you need to use external (publicly accessible) addresses.
- The genesis file must be constructed with publicly accessible addresses.
- After that you need to make sure you have your internal and external addresses mapped correctly.

Hello Everyone, 

I am a beginner in Hyperledger Indy and trying to understand the basics. 

There is one question that I am not able to relate or understand. 

What is the purpose of adding a node to an indy pool? Does the node gets added as validator node and become a part of consensus? If so what is the reward of becoming a validator node? 

Could anyone please guide me here?
</p>
<p><strong>MikeSmith</strong> (Thu, 22 Jul 2021 17:25:45 GMT):<br/>
Hello Everyone, 

I was trying to setup Indy node and as per the documentation I found only Ubuntu 16 is preferred. Is there any way to make the setup on Ubuntu 20?
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 22 Jul 2021 17:39:04 GMT):<br/>
Adding nodes to an Indy pool helps with consensus as every node currently added becomes a participator in consensus. Because of the BFT algorithm that Indy uses for consensus, the more nodes that are part of the pool, the more robust, or stable the network is (or more tolerant of nodes going down or unavailable).  
The best benefit of running a node on a public Indy network is the good feeling you get about donating to a great cause! Think of the prestige and the marketing opportunities! Participating also makes the network diverse, decentralized and viable, so if the product you are working on needs a network, it pays to support at least your favorite one, and maybe more than one, as we head into an era of multi-network compatibility and usage. Node Operators (Stewards) do not have any special write privileges on the major public networks at this time, they simply manage their node. Some networks might return some of the eventual profits of the network to Node Operators, but even then it is unlikely that it will do much more than cover costs IMO.

Patrik made it pretty easy to change just a few things to make it work for your own ledger.  Here's a link to my notes that I made while doing this first on my MAC locally, then on a public server:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1noHYmudrIyeqDh_Gitjo8LGXAC9duo7OpgYomvIGkoQ

Hi all! I would need some help with running and integrating the indy-node or sovrin in a real project. I am working on it almost for a week now, but several packages and links are broken or deprecated, even the getting started docker file from (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/docs/getting-started/run-getting-started.md)

through the Indi-CLI eventually I managed to generate an own DID, but not even with that I was able to connect to the created sandbox in the end, only to a sandboxes, which were in the list already. I guess there was some issue with the IP addresses.

Please, I am a junior software developer, and not a big master of computer science. However it would be really important to me, to integrate some way the DID based connection in our project, but need some help or further explanation, from someone who already did that.

Chances are you are looking to create an agent -- a component to use verifiable credentials -- issue, hold or verify them.  Assuming so, you should be looking at Aries, not Indy. Aries enable you to build agents to exchange verifiable credentials.

Take a look at the getting started part of the https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python README.

We've put together a course on becoming an Aries developer on edX -- https://www.edx.org/course/becoming-a-hyperledger-aries-developer

My concern is to look for a used case of Sovrin apart from BC Gov case.

<p><strong>gaberasturi</strong> (Wed, 28 Jul 2021 07:45:48 GMT):<br/>
Hello,

  I have one doubt about log levels in VON-NETWORK.
  
  At docker-compose level we have two log related environment variables.
  
  - LOG_LEVEL=${LOG_LEVEL}
  - RUST_LOG=${RUST_LOG}
  
  I suppose the levels are:
  
  INFO, WARNING, ERROR, DEBUG, TRACE
  
  But how can I enable diferents levels? or how do we need to config then? i mean how is the "string" needed to enable f.e debug level.
  
  Its posible to have granularity of logs only enabling at some of them Indy, zqm, cripto,...?
  
  Following the next link https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/INDY-1104 We are able to enable debug on each node editing `/etc/indy/indy_config.py` and adding `logLevel = 0` but want to know if there is an easier way 
  
  Thanks in advanced.

@bt333 have you tried something like https://indyscan.io/home/SOVRIN_MAINNET?
</p>
<p><strong>sergio.anguita</strong> (Wed, 28 Jul 2021 11:24:25 GMT):<br/>
its opensourced at github (https://github.com/Patrik-Stas/indyscan) - ISC LICENSE
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 28 Jul 2021 11:40:58 GMT):<br/>
Could you please open a new issue on `von-network` for this please; https://github.com/bcgov/von-network/issues.
We'll be happy to answer your questions there.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 28 Jul 2021 11:46:12 GMT):<br/>
Have you looked at [von-network](https://github.com/bcgov/von-network)?  It's a indy-node based ledger designed for use during local development.  It has a ledger browser built in so your can review the transactions on the ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 28 Jul 2021 11:47:04 GMT):<br/>
Example hosted instance; http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io/
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 28 Jul 2021 11:50:39 GMT):<br/>
When running in AWS it's important the nodes are initialized with their internal IP addresses, while when registered with the network you need to use the public IP address so nodes are able to reach each other.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 28 Jul 2021 11:53:08 GMT):<br/>
You can use `nc` to test the connection from each node to the other nodes.  example `nc -vz <node_ip_address> <node_port>`
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 28 Jul 2021 11:55:58 GMT):<br/>
Use cases are somewhat endless.  Any use case that can benefit from verifiable credentials:
- Identity
- Licensing
- Proof of origin
- Authentication and Authorization
- etc.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 28 Jul 2021 11:57:16 GMT):<br/>
Are you specifically looking for case studies?
</p>
<p><strong>Shweta1</strong> (Wed, 28 Jul 2021 13:12:09 GMT):<br/>
Thanks Wade,it is connected.but how pool_transactions_gensis will be update.this file have only first four nodes
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 28 Jul 2021 13:15:12 GMT):<br/>
The `pool_transactions_gensis` file will only contain what is originally (manually) written into it, it does not get updated automatically as new nodes are added to the pool.  It is only used to bootstrap connections to the ledger.  Once a connection is made a node or client can read to pool ledger to get the full list and state of the nodes in the pool.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 28 Jul 2021 13:22:15 GMT):<br/>
For example, the gensis file for Sovrin BuilderNet only contains four entries; https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/stable/sovrin/pool_transactions_builder_genesis
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 28 Jul 2021 13:22:15 GMT):<br/>
For example, the gensis file for Sovrin BuilderNet only contains four entries; https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/stable/sovrin/pool_transactions_builder_genesis.  While the network has 19 nodes currently.

<p><strong>Shweta1</strong> (Wed, 28 Jul 2021 13:22:46 GMT):<br/>
Thanks WadeBarnes!! so this pool_transactions_genesis will remain same.When ever i am initializing  new node,this pool transaction file should be provided first.

Hello Team, 


Can anyone please help me with N = 3f+1 , How does it actually works? Is it a possibility formula if there is 1 malicious node then there should be a total 4 nodes to handle it? 

I am trying to understand the process if a pool gets created of 4 loyal nodes and then 4 malicious nodes join the pool. How it can be prevented?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 28 Jul 2021 18:12:57 GMT):<br/>
It means if you have N nodes, you can handle up to f failures, where f = round((N - 1)/3).

So if you have a 25 node network, you can sustain up to f = 8 failures.

Likewise, if you have a 4 node network, you can sustain f =1 failures.

The balance is that the more nodes, the slower the consensus, so you have to balance speed with network resiliency.

A failure is either a node outage or a detected malicious node.

When changing an existing node's configuration you don't specify all of the parameters, only some.  For example removing a node from the network would be `ledger node target=<validator_identifier> alias=<node_alias> services=`.  `arget=<validator_identifier> alias=<node_alias>` always required.

Hi Team,

I am trying to setup von network locally and following the steps which are given here _https://github.com/bcgov/von-network#running-the-web-server-on-your-local-machine.
_
When I am executing *"GENESIS_URL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/master/sovrin/pool_transactions_sandbox_genesis LEDGER_SEED=000000000000000000000IanCostanzo PORT=9000 python -m server.server" *

It is giving error for _No module named 'indy'
_
And we resolved this using  pip install python3_indy

Later we got error for  No module named 'plenum'

And we tried to resolve using * pip install indy-plenum*

But It is failing with messages below 
_Failed building wheel for indy-plenum
Failed building wheel for orderedset
Failed building wheel for psutil_

and so on.. 

Could someone help us here? 

our python --version is 3.5.2 
and python3 --version is 3.6.13
and pip and pip3 --version is 20.3.4 (python 3.6)
</p>

Is there a particular reason you are running it directly on your machine rather than running it in the docker environment; `./manage build`, `./manage start`?  Using the docker environment contains all of the dependencies.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 04 Aug 2021 13:09:36 GMT):<br/>
If you are just trying to connect the ledger browser to another network , you are better off doing it this way; https://github.com/bcgov/von-network#running-the-web-server-in-docker-against-another-ledger

<p><strong>SwapnaliDive</strong> (Wed, 04 Aug 2021 13:14:12 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for your reply. 

We are trying to use von network web app where we can review the transctions occuring on the ledger. 

We have set up our indy network and now we want a monitoring service. We are trying to run von network locally so that we can pass our genesis file. 

But during the setup itself we are getting above errors.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 04 Aug 2021 13:57:11 GMT):<br/>
It might just be easier to make your genesis file web accessible so `von-network` can download it.
Or, update the code and docker environment to be able to accept (mount) a genesis file.  Then you could contribute that back to the project for others to use.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 04 Aug 2021 13:58:11 GMT):<br/>
For Network/Node monitoring there is this project; https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node-monitor

Hello Team, 

I wanted to know if I create a pool  on aws instance using the steps mentioned in hyperledger indy documentation `https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/node/en/latest/start-nodes.html` 

So my poolTransaction genesis file which gets created at path /var/lib/indy/sandbox, If i want to make it web accessible 

All I need to do is replace the nodeIp and clientIP from 127.0.0.1 to AWS instance's public address. 

Could someone confirm? Is there anything else required to make genesis web accessible?

Hello Team, 

Can someone help me to understand this? 

When we create a pool so we start with few number of nodes those come inside the pool genesis file. 

Are those nodes steward or trustee ? If these are not trustee then where does trustee exist? 

Also, what if my all pool *genesis * nodes are down then what will be the impact?

4 nodes are running on host1.Again I am trying to run these 4 nodes on host2.is it possible to restore all indy nodes data from

</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 10 Aug 2021 13:45:39 GMT):<br/>
Nodes only have a single role (at the moment), they are validators.

The role of Steward and Trustee is for DIDs.  A Steward DID has the permissions to manage their node's configuration on the ledger, while a Trustee is able to perform more privileged operations.

The basic roles and permissions can be found here; https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/auth_rules.md
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 10 Aug 2021 13:45:59 GMT):<br/>
Auth rules can be customized for a given network.

Hi all,
I am trying to add a new kind of transaction or modify NYM transactions to include some additional information.
Can anyone point me to the relevant places in the code to do that?
I am trying to understand indy-node and indy-plenum codebases for a couple of weeks. Looks like I need to 
add the new type of transaction to plenum. Do I need to make changes to the indy-sdk also?

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 11 Aug 2021 18:14:27 GMT):<br/>
Not sure where in the indy-node/plenum code.  If you are modifying the NYM transaction, I think (not certain) that you only have to change indy-node.  If you are using indy-sdk to send transactions, then yes, you also have to update indy-sdk with the new information being sent.

If all pool genesis nodes are down, then any agent or entity that only has the genesis file will not be able to connect to the network.
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 12 Aug 2021 14:42:43 GMT):<br/>
Hi @Amit18,  At a somewhat high level, if only some of your Nodes crash, then the data directory on those Nodes will be automatically populated when you bring the Nodes back up.  This is called "catchup", I think, and it happens on Node startup or when you first  add a node to the network.  If all nodes go down, then complications might arise that I am not 100% sure about.  There are some checks that are performed based on information in the audit ledger.  I am pretty sure that an identical copy of the Data directory could be restored to every node on the network and then it would work, but my information might be outdated.  Try it out and let us know :)
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 12 Aug 2021 14:50:57 GMT):<br/>
That's a tough one because not even the genesis files will work for getting connected to that network.  Changing the IP addresses of all of your genesis file nodes, means that you need to create new genesis files to be able to connect.  The Indy Blockchain architecture does not seem to mesh well with the scenario that you propose...

Updating the genesis file (changing it) is not allowed. It violates the blockchain "immutable ledgers" notion.  The only way to update a genesis file is to extend it to be larger so that it includes the additional changes made , for example, to update the IP addresses while the ledger is live.  The only other way to do what you are talking about is to reinstantiate the ledger, then replay all of the transactions that  you want to have on your new ledger.

Ideally, the IP addresses where we are running the node shouldn't be stored in ledger and assuming them as part of configuration files. In hyperledger fabric we use alias names for peers and orderers. is there any notation that we can use in Indy node?

Transaction rejected occurs when there are not enough nodes in the pool that are in consensus. Without more details, it's difficult for me to tell what happened to the other nodes (for a 4 node network, you need 3 to be up and participating in consensus).  Your log files might help you determine what has happened to the other nodes.  /var/log/indy/<network_name>/<alias>.log

<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 12 Aug 2021 21:22:00 GMT):<br/>
None that I know of.  Indy does not allow for anything like that, ,and I am not sure why, but it's probably for security reasons.

We have total 5 nodes running when we are trying to migrate 5th node which is running at 5th instance to 6th instance then we are not getting success.

Below are the steps that we are following : 

1) At 5th instance we are shutting down our 5th node
2) At 6th instance we are copying pool_transactions_genesis and domain_transactions_genesis from 5th instance.
3) On 6th instance we are running -- 
 	-- sudo init_indy_node Node5 <IP> 9711 <IP> 9712

	-- sudo start_indy_node Node5 <IP> 9711 <IP> 9712

	-- Then from indy-cli, using node owner did we are adding Node5

	ledger node target=<previous_target> client_port=9712 client_ip=<new_ip> alias=Node5 node_ip=<new_ip> node_port=9711 services=VALIDATOR blskey=<previous_blskey> blskey_pop=<previous_blskey_pop>

After following the above steps , other nodes able to find 5th node from new_ip but when we are starting 5th node from 6th instance it is not connecting with other nodes. 

Could anyone please verify the above steps and guide us ???

When initializing the node on the new host, you need to include the random seed that was generated from the first time you ran the init_indy_node command on the previous host, otherwise a new random seed is generated and all of the keys will be different, so it will appear to the network as a new node with a duplicate name (alias).
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 13 Aug 2021 14:16:57 GMT):<br/>
The format of the command you need to use is; `sudo -i -u indy init_indy_node <ALIAS> <node ip> <node port #> <client ip> <client port#> <seed>`
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 13 Aug 2021 14:18:10 GMT):<br/>
When you first ran the init command the output would have included a line like this:
```
Generating keys for random seed b'FA7b1cc42Da11B8F4BC83990cECF63aD'
```
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 13 Aug 2021 14:19:06 GMT):<br/>
It's that seed (the value between the single quotes) you need when re-running the init on the new host.

@swcurran thank you for the help! really appreciate it! I am doing this on a fork for my own use. I am trying to add some verification methods in the NYM transaction for including it in the DID. Currently the NYM has only verkey. I want to add more information (which are not attributes).

Hello Team, 

I also want to know is it possible to migrate those nodes as well which comes under genesisFile? If yes, does genesis file gets updated automatically?
</p>
<p><strong>Amit18</strong> (Mon, 16 Aug 2021 11:36:13 GMT):<br/>
is it possible to migrate all nodes from host1 to host2.All nodes are valdiators.
</p>
<p><strong>Amit18</strong> (Mon, 16 Aug 2021 11:36:13 GMT):<br/>
is it possible to migrate all nodes from host1 to host2.All nodes are valdiators.After Nod1,Node2,Node3 migration,i am able to do ledger transaction.But after succesful Nod4 migration,I am getting error.sometimes Node1 is not reachable or Node 2,Node3,Node4.After several restart of indy nodes,no nodes are reachable to each other
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 16 Aug 2021 12:28:59 GMT):<br/>
You need to update the genesis file manually.
</p>
<p><strong>bt333</strong> (Mon, 16 Aug 2021 13:38:45 GMT):<br/>
Could you please confirm this? 

So, If there is a pool of 100 nodes where 10 are the founder nodes and one of founder node migrated to different IP which will lead to update the genesis file manually. 

After the manual updation of Genesis file all the remaining nodes will need to update their genesis file manually? They will have to follow pool connection process again? 

Does it mean that it is recommended that founder nodes should remain at same ip and port for forever?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 16 Aug 2021 13:43:52 GMT):<br/>
Interesting.  There is a plan to create `did:indy`, and one of the 2 major purposes for that effort is to do what you are doing.  Here is the definition of what is planned: https://hackmd.io/@icZC4epNSnqBbYE0hJYseA/S1eUS2BQw

I think the change is in indy-node only (on the ledger side), but am not certain.  And there would be indy-sdk/indy-vdr changes on the client side to retrieve the data.

Dear Wade Barnes,
Thank you for your answer!

My plans are install Hyperledger indy, run test version. Do some project. Maybe related to DIDs.

My thesis subjects is in Hypereledger Indy and DIDs, so I have to do some project on it. 
I do not know why there is no much information about Indy on youtube.

@huzhiyang, You may find it easier to get started with https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python
The tutorials and getting started guides are more up to date.  It provides a layer of abstraction that hides many of the intricate complexities on Indy.

I think that is possible, but really everything would have to be the same, so it would probably be quite difficult to succeed. (Each node would have to restore their own original same keys, same IP's, same aliases, etc)
I am not sure about the migrate, all of what I have worked with is multiple separately managed nodes for networks.

Hi, I'm trying to connect the indy sample to a production network, instead of the local docker indy pool. The network is set up and I can connect to it via the indy CLI, using the network's genesis file. But when I try to use that same genesis file to connect from my indy-sdk environment (which is local to my machine, same as the indy CLI) it times out (`UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: IndyError: PoolLedgerTimeout`). I think this could mean that the network is not configured to accept all the right traffic... but if that's the case how come my indy CLI from the same machine _can_ connect? Has anyone had this issue? Does anyone have an idea?

Hi! I am Meng Kang, a Master’s student in Electrical Engineering supervised by Dr.Victria Lemieux. We are looking for people with a background in blockchain, cryptography, or software engineering to volunteer for an anonymous survey. You will first watch a presentation video of our software design research project ‘A Decentralized Identity-Based Blockchain Solution for Privacy-Preserving Licensing of Individual-Owned Data to Prevent Unauthorized Secondary Data Usage’, and then provide your feedback by filling out an online questionnaire.

Here is the link for the presentation video:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X7epdOwUB0SvDOlKrDeGU8l8eKwWSiLd/view?usp=sharing
Here is the link to the survey: https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3C4Yp2FPiHufmM6
Here is the PDF version of the video: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pbjmTVxWe6HQ4Jge-qR0-xS3nn2rIRAW/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=105944806570308548495&rtpof=true&sd=true

The video will take you 20 minutes to watch, and the survey will take you another 20 minutes to complete.

Thank you for your time and feedback on our research.
Please contact me via meng.kang@ubc.ca if you have further interest in this study.

Hi, it seems like there are many potential avenues to implement wallet recovery in the case of loss or breach, though no method is implemented at the Indy level (source: https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=9mcnDczAp8WwMpRXo).

Does anyone have a suggestion for (open source) wallet recovery protocols/solutions? Even if they only work for a particular wallet implementation?

Hi 
I'm new to Indy and installation and testing was done successful on EC2 instances with public ip's but now to productionize the same for client we need to use private subnet to host indy network. So can we use AWS NAT gateway to make this communication ?

Occasionally, writing data to the indy ledger does not cause errors, but data is not registered in the ledger. The ledger is using a docker.
Do you know anything about this Situation?

Hi team,
We are using stable libindy.so for android and see some issue with storing credentials on wallet.

For debugging, We are trying to build the libindy for android following the steps mentioned here (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/docs/build-guides/android-build.md), with additional logs. We used v1.15 of source code from github for this.

We were able to build it, but are seeing a different error while in the call to indy_add_wallet_record. 
This error was not seen when we used the stable libindy from here(https://repo.sovrin.org/android/libindy/stable/1.15.0/) 

So, the question is, how are the stable build libraries built? Are there different scripts to generate them? We followed the steps mentioned in the github link above.

Hello Team,

      I created two pools using indy cli namely pool1 and pool2. 
      Why I can not use the created schemas on pool1 to create credential defination on pool2. In this case, I am using the same Indy Node Setup. 

I am not able to undestand conceptually Indy Network , Pool setup with Indy nodes, 
pool setup with indy-cli. What is the exact difference. Can someone please help to enlighten the concepts. 

Thank you.

Hi I'm having trouble with the "How to start local nodes pool with docker" Ledger... somehow a build_get_nym_request is failing with "indy.error.CommonInvalidStructure". The thing is... it was working just fine until I sent a build_nym_request and sign_and_submit_request.... then it simply broke... Is there a way to reset the local pool docker ledger? what have I broke?

Hello,  In the Indy CLI the abbreviated "pool" is actually a "pool handle" that points to a network or pool of nodes.  So IF both pool1 and pool2 from your example used the same genesis file during setup, then they both refer to the same network and schemas created while you were connected to pool1 CAN be used to create credential-definitions on pool2, because in this case they are referencing the same network.
From the Indy Node perspective, the network contains a "Pool Ledger' which is a record of all of the nodes added to that network. So from this perspective a "pool" is the group of nodes in the same network. 
Does that help?

Of course. I have a DID in ebsi ledger and want to associate that DID with another DID in indy ledger
</p>
<p><strong>HakanTUB</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 11:32:27 GMT):<br/>
this is to make a proof that the DID issuing credentials in indy network has the right to do so. And that right is basically coming from did:ebsi
</p>
<p><strong>HakanTUB</strong> (Wed, 06 Oct 2021 11:32:49 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>conanoc</strong> (Thu, 07 Oct 2021 02:48:20 GMT):<br/>
You could write an indy DID in the DID doc. of ebsi if ebsi allows writing such metadata in the DID doc.
</p>
<p><strong>conanoc</strong> (Thu, 07 Oct 2021 03:05:38 GMT):<br/>
You also can add attributes in Indy DID https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/node/en/latest/requests.html#attrib
In this case, you should add a proof as an attribute, for example, a signature of the owner of did:ebsi signing the indy DID. Then, you could prove that the owner of the indy DID is the owner of ebsi DID.

I create a proof request, and execute "anoncreds.prover_get_credentials_for_proof_req" without trouble, receiving all valid credentials for it.
I then create the the proof with "anoncreds.prover_create_proof" without trouble.
The problem comes when I try to verify the proof.
Since I use validation for attributes as well, I wonder why it is not working.
I will place all payloads in as comments on this thread.
I'd appreciate if any one could help me...

Question with regards to endorsing transactions. When trying to submit a transaction as a DID that is not ENDORSER I get the following error (which makes sense). However one of the OR requirements doesn't make fully sense to me. It mentions *OR 1 signature of any role is required and needs to be owner with additional metadata fees attrib_add*

Could someone explain to me what this means and how this requirement could be achieved? :)

```
Ledger rejected transaction request: client request invalid: UnauthorizedClientRequest('Rule for this action is: 1 TRUSTEE signature is required and needs to be owner OR 1 STEWARD signature is required and needs to be owner OR 1 ENDORSER signature is required and needs to be owner OR 1 NETWORK_MONITOR signature is required and needs to be owner OR 1 signature of any role is required and needs to be owner with additional metadata fees attrib_add OR 1 ENDORSER signature is required AND 1 signature of any role is required and needs to be owner\nFailed checks:\nConstraint: 1 TRUSTEE signature is required and needs to be owner, Error: Not enough TRUSTEE signatures\nConstraint: 1 STEWARD signature is required and needs to be owner, Error: Not enough STEWARD signatures\nConstraint: 1 ENDORSER signature is required and needs to be owner, Error: Not enough ENDORSER signatures\nConstraint: 1 NETWORK_MONITOR signature is required and needs to be owner, Error: Not enough NETWORK_MONITOR signatures\nConstraint: 1 signature of any role is required and needs to be owner with additional metadata fees attrib_add, Error: Fees are required for this txn type\nConstraint: 1 ENDORSER signature is required AND 1 signature of any role is required and needs to be owner, Error: Not enough ENDORSER signatures',)

Hello! An interesting question about the workings of revocation registries popped up.
For example there are 3 entities: A, B and C.
A is organizationally superior to B, and B > C.
This means that A manages B, and B manages C.
B then issues a credential T to C, and sets up the revocation registry R for it.
In a scenario where A sees the credential as being irregularly issued, how can A access the revocation registry set up by B, in order to revoke that credential?
Can B, when publishing the revocation registry to the ledger configure authorization for A to publish on it as well?
How can that be done?

I have a question, with blockchain Indy can you store information besides the did, or my other assumption is that it needs to be used with other blockchain to store additional information, Thanks

on Indy nothing gets stored on chain besides the did, schemas, cred defs, and revocation pointers.  Its designed that way so that privacy and anonymity are the default.  If you want to store data on chain then you have to use some other technology explicitly.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 12 Oct 2021 15:29:43 GMT):<br/>
The idea with Indy is that you don't put data on the blockchain -- you only put public information, notably a DID, and schema information.  Nothing about the verifiable credential goes on the ledger.

Hi Timo,  Short Answer - You must own the DID you are adding or editing the attrib for, and add the ledger fees associated with the fee named "attrib_add" for that specific requirement. 
More details:  The error is essentially listing all of the possible ways to authorize the requested transaction and is based on the Auth_Rules for the ledger you are using. For example, the Sovrin BuilderNet currently has Auth_Rules that would produce that kind of output. You can see all of the auth_rules using: `indy-cli> ledger get-auth-rule` 
The part of the message you asked about refers to any owner of the DID that wants to change or add an attrib has to pay the ledger fee associated with the request  (the fee named attrib_add).  I looked on the Buildernet to see what the current fee is and it appears that the fee table for the "sov" payment method has been removed, so that effectively invalidates that method of satisfying the auth_rule.
The only method currently valid on the builldernet for an "Author" (no role) to get their attrib added or changed is to have an endorser sign that transaction.  The same is not true for the Sovrin StagingNet or the Sovrin MainNet, so as you progress towards "production" know that the rules will change (for Sovrin's networks). On the Sovrin Staging and Main networks (And on all Indicio networks), the owner of a DID can change their attribs as much as they would like to.  @WadeBarnes might want to look into fixing that inconsistency.   Even more data  for those that  are still with me :) (Sorry for the huge post)This has been an issue historically. The network operators want to charge for attrib writes to the ledger, but the original implementation had a bug in the auth_rule restricting an Author from being able to change their attrib regardless of what signature was on the txn.  There was a "quick fix" applied to remove the bug but that fix made it "free" for authors to add/edit their attribs (can't track them down to ask for payment). Then the overall issue was never re-addressed or fixed for the desired ability to charge for it. BuilderNet seems to have addressed the bug and the ability to charge for the txn. It looks like the correct fix was applied there, but then never propagated to the other Sovrin ledgers.
</p>
<p><strong>TimoGlastra</strong> (Thu, 14 Oct 2021 21:32:29 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for this really detailed answer Lynn! This is really helpful :) We're currently testing a setup where we let an endorser submit a new DID to the ledger, but then want to use that DID as the public DID on an ACA-Py agent. When we start ACA-Py it will automatically try to update the endpoint on the ledger (which is a desired feature because we want the endpoint on the ledger), but currently rejects with the following error. Would you say this won't happen on either Sovrin staging or main net? Do you know if there are any plans to change this?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 14 Oct 2021 23:07:34 GMT):<br/>
FYI -- @ianco is working on automatic/configured endorsing in ACA-Py, so that an endorser can sign any transaction needed by an author that they agree to endorse.
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 14 Oct 2021 23:13:22 GMT):<br/>
FYI Right now we have endorser support built in for Schema, Cred Def and Revocation functions, but not (yet) for updating DID attrs
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 14 Oct 2021 23:14:11 GMT):<br/>
As I understand from @lynn.bendixsen 's answer, if you are the DID owner you can write the transaction (with fees) without any endorser signature
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 14 Oct 2021 23:14:13 GMT):<br/>
OR
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 14 Oct 2021 23:14:28 GMT):<br/>
You can get the transaction endorsed, and then write it to the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Thu, 14 Oct 2021 23:14:46 GMT):<br/>
I'll add this (endorser support for DID attrs) to the TODO list
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 14 Oct 2021 23:29:08 GMT):<br/>
@TimoGlastra The way it currently stands, I am pretty sure you won't get an error on Sovrin's Staging or MainNet. You could test the behavior on Indicio's Testnet, if you like, as it is currently set up with the same over-permissive Auth_Rule for attribs.  
The way it currently works makes it really hard for Sovrin to collect the listed attrib fees for their networks, though, so if I had to guess, I would say not to count on it being that way for the long term.  It's really up to Sovrin on how they manage that though.
While I am answering your specific question, the other posters in this thread  are pointing at what is probably the real answer to your issue. (Auto-endorsing would likely help to resolve the error you are seeing in your use case.)

Not sure what you mean Lynn about the fees.  There should be no rules that even mention fees as I would assume that is tied to the token.  We'll look at that.

As far as tracing the fees, it's pretty easy -- the ATTRIB is tied to a DID that was endorsed by an Endorser (or is an Endorser). That's how must cover the ATTRIB transaction on ledgers that have fees.

Hi i'm trying to use this image right here https://hub.docker.com/r/bcgovimages/von-image/tags unlike the one hosted on Github, this one doesn't come with manage.py to run a localhost testnet. My question is how do I use this image, when checked there are only 3 items inside namely requirements.txt, logs and ledger which the later are empty folders.

Hi @shanest, What is it you are trying to do with the image?  `von-image` has a number of different uses.
If you are trying to run a local dev ledger, I'd recommend referring to [von-network](https://github.com/bcgov/von-network) and using the `./manage` script to `build`, `start`, and `stop` the ledger.  If it's the [von-network-base](https://github.com/bcgov/von-network/pkgs/container/von-network-base) image you're referring to as the "one hosted in GitHub", `von-image` is the base image for that image; https://github.com/bcgov/von-network/blob/master/Dockerfile#L1
</p>

<p><strong>shanest</strong> (Wed, 20 Oct 2021 13:38:43 GMT):<br/>
Yep. im building a demo and trying to run local dev ledger. I'm assuming I could do the initialization of von-network within a single docker-compose file actually. In that case, I'll stick to using the former. Thanks Wade.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 20 Oct 2021 13:40:06 GMT):<br/>
`von-network` is based on docker-compose.  It has everything you need to run an local dev ledger.

Hi, I am trying to make an open source Authentication System which will be used as an authentication tool for a crypto-currency based private project.
I am confused whether I should be using the Kadena chain (as it supports more transactions) or should I be using Aries or Indy?
As the summary of explanation says that Aries is a tool, could it be used with Kadena as a blockchain?

"Huge indy network" is currently not advised.   The current recommendation is 25 distributed nodes and you might be okay going as high as 32 but would likely run into performance issues if you go any higher than that.

On Linux (or Mac) I use `pwgen -s 32 -1` to generate my secure seeds.
You could also use a password keeper program. 1Password has an option to generate a 32 character password (seed). And 1Password is a secure way to store the seeds too.

Indy is the ledger.  Aries allows you to build agents that are peer to peer and that talk to  whatever ledger you are using.

With VCs you don't us

Indy is the ledger.  Aries allows you to build agents that are peer to peer and that talk to  whatever ledger you are using.

With VCs you don't write to the ledger when issuing or verifying credentials.  You can issue a billion VCs using just a single ledger transaction, so the scale of something like financial transactions is different.

Nothing about a VC itself goes on the ledger, and nothing is written at ledger issuance time.

No problem.  Since writing occurs when you want to define a type of credential, and not when you issue a credential, the volumes are way lower.  The highest writing  is in revoking credentials (if that is needed) and for most business cases, that happens once a day per type of credential.

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 25 Oct 2021 17:37:07 GMT):<br/>
Revocation is still something we'd like to scale, but it's not a ledger issue to scale it -- it's getting the right cryptography for revocation.

There is no need for a blockchain for VCs. The VCs are shared p2p -- the issuer creates a VC for a holder and gives it to that holder.  The holder keeps it locally. A verifier requests a presentation that requires the use of the VC, and the holder constructs the proof based on the VC and gives it to the verifier.  Nothing about the issuance or verification requires writing to a blockchain.

Does that make sense?

I think I understand that, VC is a virtual coin which is developed and distributed by an organisation or identity or group to its members. They hold it and the value of coin rises according to the demand and usage. I don't think it will stay locally if it is part of a blockchain, afterall we are creating the VC out of an established coin/currency.

As per my understanding, We need blockchain to keep the data secure, we can call it somewhat secure database. But, If I am making an ecommerce website and keeping the identity and currency and its transactions and making smart contracts for distribution of currency according to some rules, then will that not be the use of Blockchain? VC is a subcoin (sub currency) which I can customize and make using the parent financial blockchain's rules and algo. Please correct me if I either missed something or didn't understand or misunderstood something.

Topic: Transaction Endorser for Sovrin Main Net. Hi I have developed a aca-py controller, that issues credentials currently on Sovrins BuilderNet. Our goal is to be able to issue credentials anchored on Sovrins Main Net. We therefore need an endorser for our transaction. We are Swiss-based non profit organisation and are now looking for an endorser that we can use together with the new endorsing functionality provided by aca-py. Is anybody working on this right now or nows of an endorser that cloud provide this functionality for us?

Hello Team, 
   
      How can I generate genesis nodes transaction file using separate ips for node and client

Node example with separate client_ip and node_ip - 

{"alias":"ev1","client_ip":"54.207.36.81","client_port":"9702","node_ip":"18.231.96.215","node_port":"9701","services":["VALIDATOR"]},"dest":"GWgp6huggos5HrzHVDy5xeBkYHxPvrRZzjPNAyJAqpjA"},"metadata":{"from":"J4N1K1SEB8uY2muwmecY5q"},"type":"0"},"txnMetadata":{"seqNo":1,"txnId":"b0c82a3ade3497964cb8034be915da179459287823d92b5717e6d642784c50e6"},"ver":"1"}

Would you be able to provide a bit more background on what you're doing?
</p>
<p><strong>SwapnaliDive</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 13:32:18 GMT):<br/>
For security reasons I read, we should keep node_ip address and client_ip as different, becuase if we connect cli with validator node and if the node_ip and client_ip address is same in that case user may access the steward node information

Are you trying to build your own indy network?  If so for what purpose?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 13:36:31 GMT):<br/>
If for development, your better bet is [bcgov/von-network](https://github.com/bcgov/von-network).
If for `beta`, `test`, or `prod`, there are the hosted Sovrin Networks; https://sovrin.org/overview/
</p>
<p><strong>SwapnaliDive</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 13:37:43 GMT):<br/>
If I see the soverin genesis file 
Link :  https://sovrin-mainnet-browser.vonx.io/genesis
how to set different addresses that too for genesis file.
</p>
<p><strong>SwapnaliDive</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 13:38:10 GMT):<br/>
I am building own indy network just to figure out how exactly the things work between the nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 13:39:49 GMT):<br/>
Resources for that are here; https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/issues/1674

The `Create New Indy Network` is the better of the two.  It also provides a link to the script used to generate the genesis files.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 27 Oct 2021 13:41:43 GMT):<br/>
As for building a node that supports two IP addresses, you'll need to configure your nodes with two separate network interfaces and assign separate IPs.

We are definitely not talking about the same thing.  I'm talking about Verifiable Credentials as VCs, and they are not a virtual currency or coin -- nothing to do with that.  A VC is like a paper credential (e.g. a driver's licence, passport, university degree) that an issuer gives to a holder and the holder presents to a verifier.

No cryptocurrency involved in the general use case.

oh.. I thought we are discussing the use case I mentioned.
</p>
<p><strong>webspeller</strong> (Thu, 28 Oct 2021 16:27:13 GMT):<br/>
I am trying to figure out the tech stack with the amount of knowledge I have. There are 2 projects 1) An Identity Platform, something like Evernym or Kiva
</p>
<p><strong>webspeller</strong> (Thu, 28 Oct 2021 16:28:05 GMT):<br/>
2) A web platform which will allow clients identified through project 1. This web platform will use currency ( a Coin on Kadena Blockchain).
</p>
<p><strong>webspeller</strong> (Thu, 28 Oct 2021 16:29:20 GMT):<br/>
My confusion is, Whether I should be using Kadena as a blockchain for: 1) both the projects 2) Either of the projects 3) for coin only.
</p>
<p><strong>webspeller</strong> (Thu, 28 Oct 2021 16:31:22 GMT):<br/>
If not Kadena, then should I be using Indy as blockchain and Aries as web/mobile p2p transaction tool (I believe it is something like Evernym video, in which they have made a mobile app and once they scan the QR code through mobile they get the certificate downloaded to their mobile and can use that further for transaction or communication with the organisation).
</p>
<p><strong>webspeller</strong> (Thu, 28 Oct 2021 16:52:26 GMT):<br/>
I am worried abt both the issuence of tokens on chain as well as verification of ID/person each time they connect to access the VC (verifiable credential).

To get started, use von-network as your ledger and an Aries agent (perhap ACA-Py) as your "ledger client".  The Aries agent embeds the indy-sdk code.  That bootstrapping will help your understanding for building to a production product.

Hello Team , 

How did the sovrin network integrated the payment mechanism on the network? Is is managed on-chain or off-chain? We saw the payment functions in indy-cli but couldn't decipher what was the currency and/or token used and how it's done.

Can someone please guide us on the same

The payment mechanism is on ledger.  It's still experimental and is only available on BuilderNet and StagingNet.  More information can be found here; https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Token-Test-Instructions.pdf

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 15 Nov 2021 14:18:57 GMT):<br/>
The references to the token have been temporarily removed from the https://selfserve.sovrin.org/ page.  You can still register for test tokens using the following `curl`:
```
curl --location --request POST 'https://selfserve.sovrin.org/nym' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "network": "buildernet",
  "did": "your_did",
  "verkey": "<your_verkey",
  "paymentaddr": "<your_address>"
}'
```

Hello,

  We have a doubt about credentials revocation and tails file and what is write into the ledger.
  
  We are using .NET implementation.
  
  When we register a revocable credential we see that in the ledger at REVOC_REG_DEF the tails fail location URI is composed by Issuer endpoint URI + /tails/....
  
  `Tails file location: http://ISSUER_URI/tails/......`
  
  This location URI is working so we understand that Issuer is doing as "proxy" to tails server? because our tails server is in other location. Yes we are registering in the Issuer `RevocationServerUrl` pointing to the tails sever.
  
  As is pointed in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/tree/master/text/0011-cred-revocation#putting-it-all-together
  
  > - Verifiers do not need to contact issuers or consult a revocation list to test revocation.
  
  We are assuming that nobody (Verifier or Prover) need to interact with Issuer in verfication protocol.

  Our doubt is if all is working as expected? or we have something bad configured.
  
  Thanks in advanced.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 20:32:22 GMT):<br/>
The issuer needs to publish the tails file for a revocation registry, and needs to write updates to the RevReg on the ledger (RevRegEntry transactions).

The holder needs to get the tails file associated with the credential issued to them. This is a static file, so in theory, they only need to grab it once and hold on to it. To construct a proof, they need to get the RevReg state (usually, the latest) from the ledger, and use that with the tails file to create a proof of non-revocation.

The verifier needs to get the RevReg state as well (just the accumulator from that) and use that to verify the proof of non-revocation.

Hope that makes sense.

Hello,

I am setting up environment for developing indy-node and meeting some problems: `pytest` outputs errors.
When testing indy-plenum, I got the following output.
```
= 7 failed, 11453 passed, 307 skipped, 71 warnings, 1089 error in 2380.80 seconds =
```

I executed commands according to https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/setup-dev.md on ubuntu 16 https://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/ , but the test `pytest . ` did not run.
According to error messages, I executed `pip install --upgrade 'setuptools<45.0.0`, `pip install pip==9.0.3` and so on.
Then, `pytest .` ran but showed errors.

For example I got the following. Actually, plenum/config.py does not include `GENESIS_DIR`
```
E       AttributeError: module 'plenum.config' has no attribute 'GENESIS_DIR'
```

If this question is not suitable here, I would appreciate it if you could tell me where I should write.
Thanks in adnvace.

but our doubt is more related about if the issuer need to act like a proxy to reach the tail server.

We expected tails location file is provided by tails server URL not through Issuer enpoint URI.

Hello,
We are developing a .NET web agent which has to support the revoke functionality.
The ledger operation is rejected for some reason, when we try to send a Revocation Registry Entry to the network.
We have performed the following steps:
- Credential definition was successfully created,
- The tails file was created;
- The REVOC_REG_DEF transaction passes as expected.
- The initial REVOC_REG_ENTRY is successfully sent.
But when try to revoke a document, the REVOC_REG_ENTRY transaction is rejected.
Does anybody have a clue what can be the problem?
Thx in advance.

Ah...the tails server URL is given to the issuer in ACA-Py so they know where to put the tails file.  The holder is only told of the full URL of the tails file itself. Does that make sense?

Note that the idea of a "tails server" is an add on to make publishing easier.  In Indy, the only requirement is that the tails file be somewhere, and the credential given to the holder has a URL to the file.
</p>
<p><strong>gaberasturi</strong> (Thu, 18 Nov 2021 15:16:13 GMT):<br/>
Yes we registered/configured in the Issuer `RevocationServerUrl` pointing to the tails sever. f.e http://TAILS_SERVER/ so what we are expecting (maybe wrong) is that the URL to the tails file be http://TAILS_SERVER/tails/... instead of http://ISSUER_SERVER/tails/... and what we are getting registered in the ledger is Tails file location: http://ISSUER_SERVER/tails/...
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 18 Nov 2021 15:18:43 GMT):<br/>
Hmmm...sounds like something is wrong in the config. I'd say post an issue in either the ACA-Py or Tails Server repo with your configs.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 18 Nov 2021 15:19:05 GMT):<br/>
Have you looked at the Alice-Faber demo in ACA-Py, with the revocation option set?
</p>
<p><strong>gaberasturi</strong> (Thu, 18 Nov 2021 15:26:21 GMT):<br/>
Hmmm maybe the problem is that we are NOT using ACA-Py but .NET?
- VON-NETWORK Ledger
- Indy Tails Server (with all tests passed)

I going to review Alice-Faber demo in ACA-Py with the revocation option set.

Was found which was the problem. We were creating the credential definition with the endpoint.Did, but the library Revoke method uses IssuerDid. Thus DIDs were different.
Thx for logs suggestion, did the thing.

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 19 Nov 2021 17:27:05 GMT):<br/>
You shouldn't have to disable TAA services when adding new nodes.

For Node5, double check the mapping of the external to internal IP/Ports.  Make sure they are not reversed.  Also what are the external IPs you are using to register Node5 with the network?  I've checked Nodes1 to 4 and their ports seem to be open.

You should have a look at https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python.  It's provides a higher level starting point for building applications and abstracts many of the complexities of the `indy-sdk`.

Hello Team, 

	Using the TRUSTEE's DID I am setting the TAA as follows using incy-cli : 

	1) ledger txn-acceptance-mechanisms aml={"Session Agreement":"some description"} version=1 send=true

	2) ledger txn-author-agreement text="some description" version=1 send=true ratification-timestamp=1637837478

	After enabling the TAA I am starting the indy-cli like -

	indy-cli --config taa-config.json 

	taa-config.json file have the below contents: 

	{
   		"taaAcceptanceMechanism": "Session Agreement" 
	} 

	After setting up TAA I am trying to add the new nodes into the network using indy-cli "ledger node" command which is failing network. We are not able to write on ledger.

	Can someone please confirm the method of enabling the TAA on the ledger ?

You should focus on getting a single node connected successfully at a time.  Otherwise you'll run into consensus issues, which you've already seend, and then you won't be able to do anything.

Hello, everyone!
When try to create a proof (AnonCreds.ProverCreateProofAsync) providing a mix of revocable and non-revocable credentials, it returns an error saying "A value being processed is not valid". 
Is this case supported by Indy?
Thank you!
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 26 Nov 2021 15:09:02 GMT):<br/>
It certainly should be -- I've not heard anyone saying this had been a problem, and we did a lot of testing in implementing revocation in ACA-Py.  Likely sharing the details is needed -- try to simplify your PR as much as possible.
</p>
<p><strong>vasile135</strong> (Fri, 26 Nov 2021 15:24:22 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for response. 
I followed your advice from here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet/issues/184#issuecomment-816187518.
If I drop the revocation interval, I'm able to create a proof.
But, in this case, when I call AnonCreds.VerifierVerifyProofAsync as verifier, an error is thrown, probably because verifier's proof request still has RevocationInterval.
hmmm...

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 26 Nov 2021 16:41:28 GMT):<br/>
The key question is where the issue is coming from -- is it happening in Aries Framework .NET, or is it in Indy?

It would be good to try this in ACA-Py to see what it does with this scenario.

@esune @ianco -- have either of you ever tried this use case -- a PR asking for revocation, with two credentials being used in the Proof, one revocable, one not.
</p>
<p><strong>vasile135</strong> (Fri, 26 Nov 2021 16:42:58 GMT):<br/>
Thank you, @swcurran
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 26 Nov 2021 17:10:44 GMT):<br/>
I see that you're not providing any restrictions in your proof request.  In this case the attributes are "self attested" and I'm not sure how revocation is handled in this scenario (I would expect an error, because self attested attributes can't be revoked)
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 26 Nov 2021 17:11:20 GMT):<br/>
Try using the schema id, schema name or cred def is as a restriction and see how the proof is handled
</p>

Hi, can someone tell me how do we ensure that the credential we issue cannot be tampered by the holder?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sat, 27 Nov 2021 21:22:29 GMT):<br/>
All of the attributes in the messages are signed by the issuer and given to the holder. If the holder tampers with any of the messages, the signatures will not verify.

Note that in AnonCreds, there is the raw data (e.g. strings, dates, numbers) and there is the encoded value (always integers). It is the encoded value that is signed.  So the verifier must also verify that the raw data can be encoded in the way the issuer had done so before signing the encoded values.  The Indy verifier library does that.

`vc-authn` is a standard OIDC identity provider. How you configure your app will depend on the plugin you are using as OIDC client, this is an example of what `oidc-js` would take as input configuration: https://github.com/bcgov/essential-services-delivery/blob/main/openshift/templates/issuer-web/config/esr2/dev/config.json#L15-L34

Hey all. I was trying to find out what cryptographic construction is used for forming the `aggregated_proof.c_hash` and `aggregated_proof.c_list`? And do I get it right that the purpose of aggregated proof is to ensure that the proofs being verified were in fact generated together?

This would indicate Node5 does not recognize the DID you are using for the query.  It could be that it has not completed synchronizing with the other nodes, therefore it does not have record of that DID yet.
</p>
<p><strong>Shweta1</strong> (Mon, 06 Dec 2021 14:55:58 GMT):<br/>
what is the issue when node is not synchronizing?I can see one info new node log "Node5:0 primary has been disconnected for too long"

</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 06 Dec 2021 14:58:24 GMT):<br/>
Typically it's because the new node can't communicate with the other nodes.  Either because of connectivity issues between the nodes, or the node has not been registered with the network and therefore is not recognized as a valid node.

all node are reachable and new node is registered into network too.but catchupService is not working properly for new node.Why this is not working .Attached info
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 06 Dec 2021 15:53:48 GMT):<br/>
How many transactions are on the ledger and how long has Node5 been running?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 06 Dec 2021 15:56:48 GMT):<br/>
What is the output of `sudo validator-info` when run on Node5?  What is the output when run on another node?

If you are just needing a ledger for development purposes or for a POC you could use; [von-network](https://github.com/bcgov/von-network).
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 14:13:34 GMT):<br/>
Another option is; [indy-node-container](https://github.com/IDunion/indy-node-container).
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 14:15:12 GMT):<br/>
You could also use the Sovrin Networks, starting with BuilderNet, which provide a path to a production hosted environment; https://sovrin.org/overview/
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 14:18:18 GMT):<br/>
If you still want to setup your own network there are some guides here;
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/issues/1674
Which are the basis for the updated documents in this PR; https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/pull/1689
</p>
<p><strong>PalanisamyChellappan</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 16:58:36 GMT):<br/>
i have tried von network. that also throws python library mismatch errors. i will try the another options and wll update to you.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 17:00:07 GMT):<br/>
You shouldn't get python library mismatch errors with von-network.  You run it by issuing two commands; ./manage build`, `./manage start`.

That is spins up the nodes and the ledger browser in containers.

</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 17:07:51 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>PalanisamyChellappan</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 17:08:07 GMT):<br/>
which branch you had tried

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 17:08:33 GMT):<br/>
`main` , I renamed `master` this morning.
</p>
<p><strong>PalanisamyChellappan</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 17:08:58 GMT):<br/>
alright.. i will clone that now
</p>
<p><strong>PalanisamyChellappan</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 17:09:16 GMT):<br/>
i am using  Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 17:09:53 GMT):<br/>
I built and ran von-network on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS yesterday.
</p>
<p><strong>PalanisamyChellappan</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 17:10:42 GMT):<br/>
ok.. python version is Python 3.6.13
</p>
<p><strong>PalanisamyChellappan</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 17:11:11 GMT):<br/>
following the below documentation
</p>
<p><strong>PalanisamyChellappan</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 17:11:13 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/bcgov/von-network/blob/main/docs/UsingVONNetwork.md
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 17:12:27 GMT):<br/>
BTW if you want to host `von-network` on a machine and have other machines connect to the ledger you would run `./manage start <host_ip> WEB_SERVER_HOST_PORT=80`
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 17:13:21 GMT):<br/>
The version of Python on the host system should not really come into play since everything is running in containers.
</p>
<p><strong>PalanisamyChellappan</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 17:13:31 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>PalanisamyChellappan</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 17:14:09 GMT):<br/>

I'd recommend using:

or 
- https://github.com/IDunion/indy-node-container
but if you're intent on building it from scratch there are these resources:

Yes, the Indy-cli can do it, so sdk calls exist that can be used to change roles.  Make sure to pass in (use) a DID with the right permissions for the role change requested, and check required permissions by looking at auth_rules.

@esune can ı use  diffetent critential for different  page  with keycloak. for example I added scopes. when ı call oidc with ```read scope``` and if user proof cridential  , user can read  page.  when ı call ```write scope``` and if user proof cridential , user can write something to page . is it possible or does any example about this  . already ı added   scopes to keycloak.  when ı call with scope ı can read userdata and scopes  .  when user click the write page , app must wants to second cridential with ```write scope```

```read scope``` and if user proof cridential  , user can read  page.  when ı call ```write scope``` and if user proof cridential , user can write something to page . is it possible or does any example about this  . already ı added   scopes to keycloak.  when ı call with scope ı can read userdata and scopes  .  when user click the write page , app must wants to second cridential with ```write scope```

Actually, what I want to do is: When I log in with different certificates, I want to  control the user role.For example, let's have the user role when I log in with user only id. When I log in with a driver's license, I want to  have a driver role.

How do you do that in the backend will vary, I think if you're using Keycloak you can define functions to assign roles based on claims received by the IdP, but I have not done that in the past.
</p>
<p><strong>esune</strong> (Tue, 14 Dec 2021 17:08:40 GMT):<br/>
You could also have the role listed in the credential and have Keycloak read it as part of a claim.

Hi, I am trying to provision 4 node Indy network as detailed out at https://github.com/bcgov/von-network, all the 4 nodes and web server on the same instance. The instance is on ubuntu 18.04, there is no public IP to the VM and I am using private IPs only to complete the setup. In the final setup I am seeing errors when these nodes are trying to communicate with each other. In the logs I can see they are trying to communicate over private IP only. Also I can see genesis file getting correctly generated with the private IP values

Are you using the latest version of `von-network`?  I had this running on an ubuntu 18.04 VM the other day when I was testing updates.
</p>
<p><strong>gpaliwal</strong> (Wed, 15 Dec 2021 18:29:46 GMT):<br/>
I think it is from main branch
executed these steps :

curl -L https://github.com/bcgov/von-network/archive/main.zip > bcovrin.zip && \
    unzip bcovrin.zip && \
    cd von-network-main && \
    chmod a+w ./server/
</p>
<p><strong>gpaliwal</strong> (Wed, 15 Dec 2021 18:32:29 GMT):<br/>
you think I should be try tagged release 1.7.2 instead of pulling it from main ?

<p><strong>esune</strong> (Wed, 15 Dec 2021 19:04:26 GMT):<br/>
Correct, using a mapper save the role as an attribute instead and then add it to the JWT generated by Keycloak when you authenticate
</p>
<p><strong>gpaliwal</strong> (Wed, 15 Dec 2021 19:22:34 GMT):<br/>
I think the issue is probably related to the VM Only, tried with a new VM, it runs perfectly fine there

I guess I will have to interfere with the keycloak codes for this. Because it only saves simple things (username name surname). Maybe if I save the schema id, I can assign a role accordingly.

I find it here https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/wrappers/python/indy/error.py

BC Gov has posted a funded "Code With Us" Challenge for individuals/teams interested in updating Hyperledger Indy to support the new `did:indy` DID Method, specified [here](https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/). The opportunity and response guidelines are [posted here](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/marketplace/opportunities/code-with-us/e3dd1605-cc1d-4c30-a9ee-245940bccd0d). The total funding for the challenge is $70,000CDN and is divided into 4 phases. The first 3 phases require the use of Python working on the [Indy Node](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node) and [Indy Plenum](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum) repos, while the 4th phase requires Rust development in the [Indy VDR](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-vdr) repo. Those responding may choose to apply for only the Python work, only the Rust work or both.

Questions can be asked here or on the website hosting the opportunity.

Applications for the challenge will be accepted up to January 10, 2022. and the work is expected to begin shortly after that date, with completion expected by March 31, 2022.

Hi all, I am new to SSI. I am confused between Indy and Aries projects.  What are their differences ?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 29 Dec 2021 12:31:34 GMT):<br/>
Aries is compatible with Indy, and in most cases, at the moment, it is built on top of Indy.  The Aries frameworks provide many layers of abstraction that make it easier for you to concentrate on creating your application without worrying about the intricacies of what's going on under the hood at the Indy levels.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 29 Dec 2021 12:31:34 GMT):<br/>
Since you're new to all this Aries is the place to start.

Read this: https://www.edx.org/course/identity-in-hyperledger-aries-indy-and-ursa ```

``` It's a lot of reading, but it explains Hyperledger Indy, along with Aries and Ursa very well. And you don't have to pay for the course. That just lets you get a certificate.

Hello everyone,
I am analyzing the attack vectors of a blockchain like ddos. Since indy uses two ports the internal consensus api cannot be accessed from the outside world. But since Indy is using ZeroMQ to handle client-server connections in a "hungry" way, the docs recommend to limit amount the parallel connections. https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/node/en/latest/setup-iptables.html#using-raw-iptables-command-or-iptables-front-end
So an attacker could open 500 parallel connections to a node to prevent new clients to interact with a node. The huge read request (just some json stuff to blow the size up) will go through something like toxy proxy to reduce my bandwidth, so the connections will be up for a long time.
Has anyone else made tests like this before? Or is this problem already solved and the docs just outdated?
</p>

This is an inherent vulnerability with Indy's current architecture. That's why each validator should run a firewall.

A DDOS that follows the deterministic leader through consensus view changes means that a sustained attack could bring down the network. But that would be very hard to achieve in practice. We did tests in 2019 where we took the network through thousands of view changes under high network load and the network recovered as soon as the attack halted.

We've talked about changing the consensus protocol to make it more robust against such attacks using an approach like Aardvark or the Tendermint protocol. At this time, no one is volunteering to do that work.

I am not talking about a DDos attack where you "bomb" a huge amount of traffic to overload the CPU and RAM of a node. This can be prevented, as you mentioned, with a rate limit for the connections of a firewall. But when I send N requests, where N is the max amount of parallel connections defined, each request is about 10MB and I am slowing down the bandwith to 1KB/s, I can block all incoming traffic for around 10.000 seconds and then run the requests again.

The consensus isn't touched at that point, but no agent will be able to send new transactions to one of the nodes, doesn't matter if its a read or write request.

I am engaged in projects applying blockchain technology for data security. For instance, sensors deployed in the field, and they collected the measurement and stream to the data aggregator. Now my project scope is to secure this data exchange and data storage. I am very new in blockchain and IT, so i am seeking guideline help if anyone can so that i can start. You may recommend me a series of courses for beginners so that i start from the beginning.
Thank you for your time!

The Indy SDK is just a library you can use to build your own software. Or did you mean indy node, the software to run a blockchain node?

I'm currently investigating if it's possible to run indy nodes on Kubernetes. Hyperledger bevel seems to support this. As far as I understand, the genesis files need to contain node IPs (not hostnames). Does anyone know how they handle this, since the Kubernetes pod IPs can change at any time?

The Indy Working Group meeting has morphed into an "Identity Implementers WG" meeting on Thursday's, every 2nd week (but cancelled today). It covers broader issues in Identity.  The Indy Contributor's call is next Tuesday and every second week.  The Aries Working Group is every week on Wednesday morning.  Those are both focused on building, deploying  and using Indy and Aries, respectively.

Indy's performance will depend hugely on how big the pool of validators is, how much RAM and        compute power they have, and how fast their network connections are. Thus, there isn't a general    "Indy performance" study. The team that builds Indy evaluates it in a specific configuration to     guarantee acceptable performance before each release. They are trying to prove sustained reads of   thousands of reads per second and >10 writes per second, with a validator pool of 25-ish, and they  have consistently achieved those metrics. Less validators would increase write performance          significantly. (10 writes per second sounds slow to me, although it is twice as fast as the global  bitcoin network. However, Indy has a number of performance optimizations that are still teed up,    that should easily allow this number to be 1-3 orders of magnitude faster when we need it. It just  hasn't been a focus for now, partly because of how skewed traffic is toward reading.) The bottom    line is that Indy's performance is predictable, and fast enough, for the use cases we have today.   And it can be increased substantially when we need to.
Exchanging credentials does not involve the ledger very much, though. Issuance doesn't require any  write with each credential--only a write of the schema, cred def, and revocation registry that they all use. So you could issue 1000 or 10M credentials, and you still only have 3 ledger writes and no ledger reads (except maybe to populate a cache). When the credential is used to present proof, the  verifier and the holder/prover each do a ledger read to check an accumulator value. These reads are likely to be cached for the holder, if they are proving regularly; in real usage, only the          verifier's reads will probably have a linear correlation to ledger traffic.

Because of the protections on correlation, performance metrics don't need to be a primary focus     (but any and all help here is very much appreciated). Time correlation means that throughput spikes ought to be spread out over time, so we don't have to worry about "visa network" type numbers.
We have been using 10 writes per second and 100 reads per second as our performance minimum (if we  fall below that we are worried). Benchmarks can go much much faster of course, the Sovrin           Foundation uses those numbers as a guideline for our production configuration on a global pool of   24 nodes.

Also, regarding performance - 10 write transactions per second can look small compared to 1000s,    but there is huge difference in benchmarking conditions:
- other ledgers usually use just 4 nodes, often inside one LAN, while 10 TPS in plenum was measured with 25 nodes scattered across the world, which increases number of messages per batch 40-fold with PBFT/Aardvark and 240-fold with RBFT, and increases latencies
- other ledgers often generate batches every 5-10 seconds, but plenum defaults to 1 batch per       second, so this is 5-10 more batches per unit of time than with other projects, but significantly   decreases latency
- other ledgers use very simple test transactions, like incrementing some counter, while in plenum  we test with writing cred defs, revocations etc with fees on top of that - many of these things use pretty heavyweight crypto
If we conduct a test in a single AWS VPC with 4 nodes, batch per 5 seconds and some dummy           transactions I believe we can easily achieve something in a 500 write transactions per second range with current code.
read performance in Indy Ledger is pretty good, this is more than 5000 per sec on 25 nodes pool,    and this is easily scalable with Observer Nodes (which are almost done BTW).

That's exactly what I'm describing. Consensus can't complete, so writes can not be processed. But any node can provide a trustworthy result signed with the state proof from before the attack.

Call to Participate - DIDComm User Group

Now that the DIDComm v2 spec is nearing completion, and there are robust libraries in multiple programming languages, we are starting a user group to share learnings as we put DIDComm into production. We will organize community resources, produce a handbook, foster application-level protocol creation, maintain the didcomm.org website and repo, and recommend best practices. We invite anyone who's interested to register in the user group's email list or discord channel:


Discord Invite: https://discord.gg/F4Qw7h6Sr9
Mailing list: https://lists.identity.foundation/g/didcomm-usergroup

The first regular meeting will be held in January, with meeting selection to happen prior. Please fill out our survey: http://whenisgood.net/d8dkhgi

Although this UG is sponsored by DIF, this is not an IP-protected context. We won't be developing specs or working on standards. Thus, you don't have to be a member of any particular org to join, and there are no legal terms to review or paperwork to sign.

Please join us!

hello ,Everyone I'm trying to create a wallet using(Indy-SDK) on local pool running on docker ,parallel connected the pool using (indy-cli). i think i created the wallet using (indy-sdk) but it's not showing the same wallet on (indy-cli) terminal and when i'm trying to create the same wallet using (indy-cli) then it's showing "Wallet already exists".
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 21 Jan 2022 14:34:10 GMT):<br/>
If the wallet already exists then you need to "attach" it to the cli.  Within the cli prompt, you can type "wallet help" or "wallet attach help" to see the options
</p>
<p><strong>ianco</strong> (Fri, 21 Jan 2022 14:34:19 GMT):<br/>
Once you "attach" the wallet then you can open it

Hi Everyone, I want to deploy indy-node to OpenShift but indy-client and indy-agent pods are missing their start.sh scripts. Is there a branch of indy-node that i can use to deploy indy-node to OpenShift?

Issuance doesn't require any write with each credential--only a write of the schema, cred def, and revocation registry that they all use. So you could issue 1000 or 10M credentials, and you still only have 3 ledger writes and no ledger reads (except maybe to populate a cache)

Folks, when I create TRUST_ANCOR in the cli like this ...

```
wallet open Government key=government_wallet_key
did new seed=000000000000000000000Government1 metadata="Government"
did use 5iWVNb56iqMoGwnY62HB1j 
ledger nym did=5iWVNb56iqMoGwnY62HB1j verkey=~5Zyg8vCV5qQfdfRwQk8w94 role=TRUST_ANCHOR endorser=Th7MpTaRZVRYnPiabds81Y
wallet close 
```

it is not stored in the ledger. In Python I see that there is a reference to the STEWARD required. How do I do that in the cli?

In batch scripts I see commands with leading dash ...

```
- ledger get-nym did=23LxaWGVajU7vMn7zcrHGK
```

How is this different from not using a dash?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 24 Jan 2022 14:04:17 GMT):<br/>
The `TRUST_ANCHOR` role has been renamed to `ENDORSER`.
Also it looks like you're attempting to write the same DID you are using.  You'll need to write the DID using a privileged DID that is already on the ledger.
Are you connecting to a ledger?  Which one?
The error messages from the commands should give some hints.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Mon, 24 Jan 2022 14:05:53 GMT):<br/>
In the batch scripts prefixing a command with `-` tells the cli to continue even if the command fails, otherwise the batch process will stop on a failed command.

Here are a couple projects you may want to check out:
- https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel
- https://github.com/IDunion/indy-node-container
</p>
<p><strong>tdiesler</strong> (Mon, 24 Jan 2022 14:17:36 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. I think I figured it out

https://github.com/tdiesler/nessus-indy/blob/ghi4/etc/getting-started-cli.batch

The error msg when the nym already exists in the ledger is a little confusing

```
Transaction has been rejected: STEWARD can not touch role field since only the owner can modify it
```

I won't complain, because I'm just starting with this ;-)

The IP addressing (what indy-node wants) and the URI addressing (what OpenShift wants) can be a little tricky.

Also the ephemeral nature of containers running on OpenShift cause issues with the automated network upgrade process of indy-node.  When a network upgrade command is issued, the nodes will perform the scheduled upgrade as requested, however this will not persist a rollout or restart, and the node running on OCP will revert to the software versions built into the image.  This can cause consensus issues, especially if there is a breaking change.  It can also pose a security risk if the upgrade was meant to resolve a security issue.

Virtual development environments have been integrated into the `ubuntu-20.04-upgrade` branches of [hyperledger/indy-node](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/tree/ubuntu-20.04-upgrade) and [hyperledger/indy-plenum](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/tree/ubuntu-20.04-upgrade).  You can now spin up a fully functional development environment in your choice of a Visual Studio Code Devcontainer or a Gitpod.
Thanks to @pSchlarb for his work on getting this done.
Happy Coding!

Folks, in indi-cli> ledger cred-def I see ...

```
ledger cred-def schema_id=1 signature_type=CL tag=1 primary={"n":"1","s":"2","rms":"3","r":{"age":"4","name":"5"},"rctxt":"6","z":"7"}
```

Where can I learn more about the primary key? Alle these `{"n":"1","s":"2","r":{"age":"4","name":"5"},"rctxt":"6","z":"7"}` seem to be required and `"rms":"3"` seems to be optional.
What do these keys mean and how do they relate to the schema?

Those scripts were designed more for demonstrating things in a local OpenShift cluster where all the moving parts are running within the same OpenShift namespace.  The scripts dynamically configure the nodes with the IP addresses assigned by OpenShift so everything can communicate.  This does not translate very well to a production environment where the nodes in OpenShift need to communicate with the outside world.

lol, I'm just now noticing this is based on work I did back in 2017.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 13:54:08 GMT):<br/>
We never did finish automating the process, and we were running into the issue with exposing the nodes to the outside world via static IP addresses from OpenShift, which was overly tricky and complicated (at the time at least).
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 14:00:26 GMT):<br/>
At the time we were looking for a way to host a pool of nodes on OpenShift for test purposes.  We ended up building out and deploying instances of [bcgov/von-network](https://github.com/bcgov/von-network) on Digital Ocean instead.  For example; http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io/

If you want to go the route of a containerized node instance the two links I provided are the best resources at the moment.
If you want to go the more traditional route there is documentation here on how to setup a new network; https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/NewNetwork/NewNetwork.md
You can also find Terraform and Ansible scripts here for setting up a node in AWS; https://github.com/CQEN-QDCE/Candy.

It seems that this primary key is generated by some higher level function. How would I generate/know these values if limited to indy-cli? The meaning of n, s, r, rctxt, z, rms is not document AFAICS.

It seems that this primary key is generated by some higher level function. How would I generate/know these values if limited to indy-cli? The meaning of n, s, r, rctxt, z, rms is not document AFAICS. 

```
{'id': 'DFuDqCYpeDNXLuc3MKooX3:3:CL:1',
 'schemaId': '1',
 'tag': 'tag',
 'type': 'CL',
 'value': {'primary': {'n': '109330..4017',
                       'r': {'age': '733086..7466',
                             'master_secret': '68361..4385',
                             'name': '479567..1881'},
                       'rctxt': '85822..43689',

```
</p>
<p><strong>tdiesler</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 15:23:36 GMT):<br/>
Perhaps `ledger cred-def` requires some involved pre-steps to obtain the primary key?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 15:33:24 GMT):<br/>
If you were limited to the `indy-cli` you would not be able to generate the cred-def.  That's why the code I pointed out in `von-network`'s containerized `indy-cli` exists.
</p>
<p><strong>tdiesler</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 15:37:23 GMT):<br/>
Ah ok, I thought it would be possible to use indy-cli alone to step through getting started. Ultimately, I need to use Java anyway. Perhaps its best to start with that right away and resort to cli when needed. WDYT?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 15:37:50 GMT):<br/>
I agree.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 15:37:50 GMT):<br/>
I agree.  Go the code route.

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 25 Jan 2022 15:41:11 GMT):<br/>
Yes.  The cred-def is generated here; https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/samples/java/src/main/java/Anoncreds.java#L50-L56

Question: Rate limits
Our use case involves building an agency on top of indy, via the java wrapper.  I'm busy testing the throughput, and the test procedure involves creating a new wallet, storing a did in it, and making a nym request to write that DID to the ledger.

Running the code in a container, and sending 100 requests, 10 concurrently at a time, maxes out at about 1 request per second. This is true for the default test network and for the sovrin builder net. 

Ive been narrowing down the issue to either being with the harddrive IO, or a limit on the indy side. Are there any rate limits on the indy side that could account for this?

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Wed, 26 Jan 2022 13:09:44 GMT):<br/>
You are running into a limit in the indy-sdk.  I can't recall the exact technical details, but many operations all go through a central blocking queue before being processed.
@andrew.whitehead or @swcurran may be able to elaborate.

Creating new wallets could have an additional delay as it derives the wallet key, depending on the configuration

Re. the call to participate in a new DIDComm Users Group that I posted last week:
We had a nice set of respondents to this survey. Unfortunately, the general consensus was that it is impossible to get us together! Almost every proposed timeslot had at least ¾ of the respondents saying they couldn’t come. We are busy!
I’m going to try again, but with the following changes:
* I’ve extended the calendar time until Feb 11, in case the early parts of a month are better for us than the end parts.
* I’ve decided to look for 30 minute slots instead of 60. I think this might be better – the commitment to attend is less heavy, and perhaps calendars will be a little more flexible. I believe we can still get a lot done in 30 minutes, if we’re well organized.
So, can we try again?

Hello, I'm looking for technical documentation on key derivation in the context of Indy Wallets and Indy Agents communication. Specifically, I would like to fully understand the key derivation processes from the provided seed to all the various elements such as the DIDs, the verkeys, etc. Could you please share some references in such regard?

In Java, I can create/store a Steward DID like this ...

```
		String stewardSeed = new JSONObject().put("seed", "000000000000000000000000Steward1").toString();
		CreateAndStoreMyDidResult didResult = Did.createAndStoreMyDid(ctx.stewardWallet, stewardSeed).get();
		ctx.stewardDid = didResult.getDid();
		ctx.stewardVkey = didResult.getVerkey();
		
		logInfo("DID Steward: did={}, vkey={}", ctx.stewardDid, ctx.stewardVkey);
		String nymRequest = Ledger.buildNymRequest(ctx.stewardDid, ctx.stewardDid, ctx.stewardVkey, null, ROLE_STEWARD).get();
		Ledger.signAndSubmitRequest(ctx.pool, ctx.stewardWallet, ctx.stewardDid, nymRequest).get();
```

and then create and later get a Schema like this ...

```
		String issuerDid = ctx.stewardDid;
		Wallet issuerWallet = ctx.stewardWallet;

		IssuerCreateSchemaResult schemaResult = Anoncreds.issuerCreateSchema(issuerDid, "Transcript", "1.2", new JSONArray(Arrays.asList("first_name","last_name","degree","status","year","average","ssn")).toString()).get();		
		logInfo(schemaResult.toString());
		Ledger.buildSchemaRequest(issuerDid, schemaResult.getSchemaJson()).get();
		ctx.transcriptSchemaId = schemaResult.getSchemaId();
		
		String schemaRequest = Ledger.buildSchemaRequest(issuerDid, schemaResult.getSchemaJson()).get();
		Ledger.signAndSubmitRequest(ctx.pool, issuerWallet, issuerDid, schemaRequest).get();

		String getSchemaRequest = Ledger.buildGetSchemaRequest(ctx.faberDid, ctx.transcriptSchemaId).get();
		String getSchemaResponse = Ledger.submitRequest(ctx.pool, getSchemaRequest).get();
		ParseResponseResult parseSchemaResult = Ledger.parseGetSchemaResponse(getSchemaResponse).get();
		logInfo(parseSchemaResult.toString());
```

With all else equal (fresh pool nodes, removed indy-client state), this does no longer work, with a seed other than `000000000000000000000000Steward1`.

For example, if I change the seed to `000000000000000000000Government1` I get the above exception. is this perhaps because of some stale state that I'm not aware of?

@tdiesler, What ledger are you using for your testing?  Does the DID fo `000000000000000000000000Steward1` already exist on the ledger before the code is run? i.e. Is that DID setup when the pool is first created?

Has the DID for `000000000000000000000Government1` been added to the ledger with endorser privileges?
</p>

<p><strong>tdiesler</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 13:45:13 GMT):<br/>
Hi Wade, its this code here (https://github.com/tdiesler/nessus-indy/blob/main/itests/samples/src/test/java/io/nessus/indy/test/SchemaTest.java#L91)

The ledger is empty, so is the indy client state. I'm currently investigate whether this could be a timing issue. i.e. the get schema request may not be able to get the schema just yet

Is that possible?
</p>
<p><strong>tdiesler</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 13:49:16 GMT):<br/>
There is PoolUtils.ensurePreviousRequestApplied(...) - maybe that's it.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 14:01:02 GMT):<br/>
What ledger are you using?  A functional ledger is always going to have some information written to it, and typically that includes a set of Steward DIDs and a Trustee DID.  Any other DIDs written to the ledger need to be "endorsed" by one or more of the foundational DIDs.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 14:01:29 GMT):<br/>
Do you know about https://github.com/bcgov/von-network?

</p>
<p><strong>tdiesler</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 14:23:17 GMT):<br/>
I'm creating the ledger with genesis Txs from PoolUtils. So far, I assumed that these nodes are not connected to a wider network and that Steward does not exist when the network is started.

Let me verify that ...
</p>
<p><strong>tdiesler</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 14:23:40 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for that pointer I'll look into it
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 14:44:26 GMT):<br/>
You're currently using this method to run a pool; correct?
```
docker build -f ci/indy-pool.dockerfile -t indy_pool ci
docker run -it -p 9701-9708:9701-9708 indy_pool
```
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 14:45:50 GMT):<br/>
I'd recommend running a `von-network` instance.  It makes the transactions on the ledger far more visible.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 14:46:29 GMT):<br/>
You'd have better insight into what "default" transactions exist on the ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>dovidkopel</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 14:48:39 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>tdiesler</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 14:59:16 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that's what I'm using.

This code here tries to register 9 Steward DIDs. It works for Steward1-4 and then fails for Steward5-9

```
		for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
			String stewardSeed = new JSONObject().put("seed", "000000000000000000000000Steward" + i).toString();
			CreateAndStoreMyDidResult didResult = Did.createAndStoreMyDid(ctx.stewardWallet, stewardSeed).get();
			ctx.stewardDid = didResult.getDid();
			ctx.stewardVkey = didResult.getVerkey();
			
			logInfo("DID Steward{}: did={}, vkey={}", i, ctx.stewardDid, ctx.stewardVkey);
			String nymRequest = Ledger.buildNymRequest(ctx.stewardDid, ctx.stewardDid, ctx.stewardVkey, null, ROLE_STEWARD).get();
			String submitResponse = Ledger.signAndSubmitRequest(ctx.pool, ctx.stewardWallet, ctx.stewardDid, nymRequest).get();
			logInfo("SubmitResponse: " + submitResponse);
		}
```

so it seems that not all of the Stewards are equal and the ledger already knows about the first for DIDs

```
2022-02-01 15:44:56 INFO  [io.nessus.indy.test.SchemaTest] - DID Steward9: did=FiYoKcGabuCtTN8fi9J8JD, vkey=92DLtcgtCreSEUu2ed8pWPcvjxwXXrzAWLq2mWVeS5An

```
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:00:24 GMT):<br/>
That's because Steward1-4 already exist as part of the pool.
</p>
<p><strong>tdiesler</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:00:44 GMT):<br/>
Is that hard coded?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:01:08 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, as part of the setup of the test pool.
</p>
<p><strong>tdiesler</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:04:56 GMT):<br/>
Anything else that already exists (e.g. some TRUST_ANCHOR perhaps)? Is that setup in GitHub somewhere?

Is it still correct to assume that I run a local ledger, not connected to wider (external) network?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:05:37 GMT):<br/>
Yes a Trustee (previously a TRUST_ANCHOR) also exists.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:07:35 GMT):<br/>
This is the code that sets up the test ledger when you use the method you're using; https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/plenum/common/test_network_setup.py
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:10:52 GMT):<br/>
It looks like there are 5 `Client` DIDs that also get generated automatically for that test ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>tdiesler</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:12:31 GMT):<br/>
Mercy. Starting with one of the Stewards, I should be able to create government, Faber, Acme & Thrift as TRUSTEE, right?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:12:33 GMT):<br/>
`von-network` generates a cleaner ledger, just the 4 Stewards (one for each node) and a single Trustee, and provides a ledger browser so you can see exactly what is on the ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:13:57 GMT):<br/>
A Steward is not allowed to create a Trustee; https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/auth_rules.md
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:14:38 GMT):<br/>
You need to sign such a transaction with a Trustee DID.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:16:29 GMT):<br/>
The DID for the default Trustee on the test ledger you are using should be `000000000000000000000000Trustee1`
</p>
<p><strong>tdiesler</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:18:33 GMT):<br/>
Getting started talks about TRUST_ANCHOR. I read somewhere that ENDORSER replaced TRUST_ANCHOR. Is that right?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:19:02 GMT):<br/>
TRUSTEE replaced TRUST_ANCHOR
</p>
<p><strong>tdiesler</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:19:32 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:25:05 GMT):<br/>
You may want to have a look at the Aries frameworks, such as https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python.  They can make working with indy ledgers much easier, as they abstract many of the lower level complexities.  Though there is not one for Java ATM.
</p>
<p><strong>tdiesler</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:25:52 GMT):<br/>
Do you want me to change the getting started Python workflow, such that it talks about TRUSTEE rather that TRUST_ANCHOR?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:26:24 GMT):<br/>
That would be great!
</p>

<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>tdiesler</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:31:07 GMT):<br/>
Ok. Government would need to have role STEWARD in order to create the Transcript + JobCertificate Schemas. Neither Government, Faber, Acme nor Thrift need to be a TRUSTEE. Role ENDORSER would also not be needed in getting started. Does that sound right?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:33:35 GMT):<br/>
Stewards operate nodes.  Trustees govern the network.  These are the highest privileged DIDs.  Endorsers are able to write Schemas and Cred_Defs to the ledger, or sign such transactions so they can be written by non-privileged DIDs.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:36:07 GMT):<br/>
You want to ensure a DID has the least amount of privilege it needs to operate, which in many cases is no privilege, provided the resources it needs are already written to the ledger, either by a privileged DID or by having the txn signed by a privileged DID (e.g. by an Endorser) .
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:37:23 GMT):<br/>
Make sense?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:39:11 GMT):<br/>
For demo purposes a DID that needs to write to the ledger is given the Endorser roll, however in real life this is not always necessary.
</p>
<p><strong>tdiesler</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 15:44:20 GMT):<br/>
How about, the preconfigured Trustee onboards Government as Trustee. Then, Government can onboard Faber, Acme and Thrift as Endorser so that they can create their respective Schemas and Cred_Defs. Alice would also need to get onboarded through Government.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 16:16:19 GMT):<br/>
That would work.

I'm still struggling a bit to make sense of Indy and Aries. If I say Indy is the DLT itself, the ledger (as fabric would be) and Aries is a set of library/tools to build clients and interfaces to work with Indy, is this a correct understanding?

There are tools that Indy has natively (like the Indy CLI), but production/consumer facing tools are built with Aries and other projects.

"How far would you say Indy and Aries are from being ready for commercial use? I've found it difficult sometimes in the documentation to see"
</p>
<p><strong>TelegramSam</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 16:33:30 GMT):<br/>
Current production deployments exist using both Indy and Aries.
</p>

​Question from livestream: "Could you give an example of a use case, where Indy would be more suitable over Fabric? I find it difficult to see how Fabric differs when it has the MSP component in it. Perhaps both can be used?"
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 17:00:10 GMT):<br/>
Indy is about Identity and the availability of public keys and metadata in order to exchange VCs.  If you are doing identity/verifiable credentials, you are better to use Indy and Aries.  Verifiable Credentials are held by the Holder and only shared when they want -- they cannot be retrieved by a verifier -- the verifier has to ask the holder for the data.

If you are publishing data on a blockchain, and you want shared access to that data with the timeline and immutablity of the data, then Fabric is right.

The only crossovers that I know:

- Using a verifiable credential to access a Fabric ledger, so you know who is using the ledger. In other words, the classic authentication/authorization, but you use VCs instead of "traditional" means.

- Using Fabric as a place to store DIDs instead of Indy.  That gets you DID functionality, and in some VC use cases, that is enough.

</p>
<p><strong>burdettadam</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:12:56 GMT):<br/>
Great question! While I have not worked much with askar yet, I believe that is a defining difference with libindy/sdk and aries-askar. Askar gives more flexibility in storage and allows direct access to the wallets secrets including the Link or master secret.

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:18:56 GMT):<br/>
You are likely missing the certificate update before you try to install the packages.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:19:02 GMT):<br/>
Example;

</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:19:56 GMT):<br/>
You can also run into certificate issues if you don't update your `ca-certificates` package.  Example; https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/ubuntu-20.04-upgrade/.devcontainer/Dockerfile#L13
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:24:18 GMT):<br/>
No. first, "Pool upgrade" is used to do a software upgrade to a new version of indy-node and other dependencies. Genesis files are created before a Network is instantiated and remain static.  You can add nodes to a network, but you do not add them to the genesis file.
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:25:05 GMT):<br/>
pool-upgrade is a remote way to tell all the nodes to update to the newest version.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:34:00 GMT):<br/>
Working example:
```
FROM ubuntu:20.04

RUN apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y \
    gnupg \
    ca-certificates

RUN apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys CE7709D068DB5E88
RUN echo "deb https://repo.sovrin.org/sdk/deb bionic stable" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
RUN apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y \
    libindy \
    indy-cli
```
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:34:00 GMT):<br/>
Working (Docker) example:
```
FROM ubuntu:20.04

RUN apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y \
    gnupg \
    ca-certificates

RUN apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys CE7709D068DB5E88
RUN echo "deb https://repo.sovrin.org/sdk/deb bionic stable" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
RUN apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y \
    libindy \
    indy-cli
```

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:34:14 GMT):<br/>
That works with 18.04 too.

</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:39:15 GMT):<br/>
I think what's missing from that page is an install or upgrade to the `ca-certificates` package.  `CE7709D068DB5E88` is the correct signing key, but it's not always recognized without the updated ca package.  This started happening late last year.
</p>
<p><strong>kwollo</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:40:06 GMT):<br/>
To return to my original question in zoom: So if a genesis node needs to be replaced, is there no way to move it to a new one?
</p>
<p><strong>kwollo</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:41:48 GMT):<br/>
This means that you cannot subsequently delete a genesis node and add a new one?
</p>
<p><strong>dioxis</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:45:02 GMT):<br/>
Can confirm that. Done a reset to my VM. Upgrade to the ca-certificates package works too.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:45:59 GMT):<br/>
`9692C00E657DDE61` is the signing key for the new Hyperledger repository where all the latest `indy-node` and `indy-plenum` packages are now being published buy the new GitHub Actions Workflows.
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:48:47 GMT):<br/>
You can remove 1 or 2 of the original nodes and be okay, but there is not an easy way to replace them.
options:
1. "Reset" the ledger (loses all data on all ledgers, but allows for new genesis files if you choose.)
2. I have actually helped update the Pool ledger for a network once, by taking the complete existing pool ledger (180+txns) and telling all network users to update to that new file as the genesis.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:55:19 GMT):<br/>
so, the original genesis nodes are never replaced (immutable ledger).  You can add "the whole network" as "genesis nodes" using option 2
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:55:19 GMT):<br/>
so, the original genesis nodes can never be removed if you want to keep the other ledger transactions (immutable ledger).  You can add "the whole network" as "genesis nodes" using option 2
</p>
<p><strong>kwollo</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 18:57:05 GMT):<br/>
All right, I have understood that now.
When a new validator node is added, does it change anything in the two genesis files? Or in general when adding a new node.
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 19:06:05 GMT):<br/>
When a new Node is added, it updates the pool sub-ledger on the network, but NOT the genesis files.  The genesis files remains static.
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 19:09:10 GMT):<br/>
When a client connects to the network, it uses the pool genesis file, then the first thing it does next is to download the rest of the pool ledger, and now uses that for connecting to all the network nodes to run any other commands.
</p>
<p><strong>kwollo</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 19:22:50 GMT):<br/>
Is it possible to read the pool_genesis with one of your tools, like indy-cli oder indy-vdr, only if the domain_genesis is available?
</p>
<p><strong>lynn.bendixsen</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 19:30:04 GMT):<br/>
Hmm, not sure I understand the question.  I am pretty sure that the indy-cli does not have anything that displays the pool genesis file.  The pool genesis is downloaded from wherever the network administrators have provided it and can be viewed there or on your workstation after downloading it.  The domain genesis is actually only used by Nodes of the network and usually only when they add themselves to the network.
The tools need you to provide the pool genesis file to be able to connect to a network.

Thanks to everyone who attended today's workshop! If you'd like to get involved in Indy Node, you can find some "good first issues" in the github repo here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/labels/good%20first%20issue

Thank you very much for your answers. I'm just wondering how to regenerate the genesis files when I'm in an existing network and I need to change a genesis node. E.g. if there is an irrreprable damage on a node and all the data is gone. So a new genesis node has to come online to reach the minimum number for operation. Then I would replace the failed node with init_indy_keys script and set a new name and seed on the new server. Then just generate the new genesis files with generate_indy_pool_transactions, right? Finally distribute the genesis files in the network: 

1. will the new node run directly with the existing network? Can it download all the transactions from the network? 

2. or do I have to create the new node 1:1 with the same name, seed, IP and import a backup of all the transactions to get it running again?
</p>

3. Or can i have a different name and seed and need a backup of the transactions to get it running again?

I've created and published the Hyperledger TSC Indy Quarterly Report here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/TSC/2022+Q1+Hyperledger+Indy

Please review and let me know if I have missed anything or have anything wrong.

Thanks!

My initial reaction is that it is not a primary use case for Indy/Aries, which are focused more on the verifiable credential model (e.g. this model as documented on the Trust Over IP website - https://trustoverip.org/toip-model/).

In general, Indy instances are NOT used to store DIDs (identifiers+public keys) for individuals, so although there is signing as a concept in Hyperledger, not signing as you might think of it in this use case.

I'm sure there are ways to do this with Indy in that you have keys as a foundational component, but it is really not a core use case supported today.

I'm sure there are ways to do the back and forth contract signing (basically, multi-sig) with Indy in that you have keys as a foundational component, but it is not a core use case supported today.

Both Indy Wallet and Askar are designed to make it easy to use the private keys in the storage, but not easy to access those keys. Signing and encryption is done by passing in the relevant objects and getting them back out signed/encrypted, without the private keys being accessible to the user. We want to prevent developers from doing bad things. Security precautions are used, like clearing memory after the operation and before data is provided back to the caller.

The advantage that Askar brings is that it has more flexibility in the types keys handled, and the operations supported (enabling different crypto schemes, like  BBS+ Signatures), uses some newer database handling for more efficient operations, and is separated from other Indy operations. In libindy, all operations share a common lock, which can cause a bottleneck.

The Master Secret is treated like a private key in Askar.

If it's just one node, then I wouldn't worry about updating the genesis files unless you want to lose everything and start over. If you can get the same seed/IPs and name on a new node, then put the old genesis files in the right place and it will come up and catch up to the other nodes (best option). Instructions here (very near the end of 3.2.3) have a note about how to run init-indy-node and get the same seeds/keys: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y0rW78_I-bRkH3qFN5kcP58jJH23Zahc363h18SmJ48
If you create and add a new node to network that is in consensus, then the same thing will happen, all of the sub-ledgers are downloaded to the new node until it is in sync with the network and a participating member.  You shouldn't ever need a backup of the transactions copied around manually.

Hi all, I am following anoncreds Java file to issue credentials. In anoncreds, the offer credentials json is sent to holder with only the attributes and without any actual credentials data, however the Aries agent cloud py has offer credentials that needed the actual data to be sent in the credentials preview . What is the actual flow if holder wants to start the conversation asking for a credential ? My flow is : holder requesting credentials >  issuer offering credentials > Holder accepts or decline to end the flow. Pls help me.

Hello everyone! I am new to the chat, so please let me know if this is not the appropriate channel for this question.

I am working through the [Indy Walkthrough](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/docs/getting-started/indy-walkthrough.md) utilizing the [Indy SDK NodeJS Wrapper](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/wrappers/nodejs/README.md) and have gotten to the point where I am creating the transcript credential for Alice from Faber using the `issuerCreateCredential` method. I am receiving a 112 Indy Error Code, which from [THIS](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/libindy/include/indy_mod.h) doc appears to be a "Invalid library state was detected in runtime. It signals library bug" error. *Is there anything I can do to enable more verbose logging?* I have tried setting the `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable and calling the `setRuntimeConfig({ "collect_backtrace": true })` at the beginning of my code, but I still receive the 112 Indy Error code with no additional information. Any guidance on how to debug this issue would be greatly appreciated!

There is a public test mediator run by Indicio that you can use.  To use a mediator with a mobile agent, you wouldn't need faber to have a mediator (which is what the --mediator argument does).

Apologies for the issues in the guide that you are using.  Steps 8 and 9 need to be moved in front of Step 5 because the keys need to be created in the directory of the new network.  @pSchlarb 
I suggest to re-run step 5, this time adding on the seed  created the first  time you ran it to the end of each init_indy_node command (so that you don't have to recreate your genesis files) then re-try step 9.

Apologies for the issues in the guide that you are using.  Steps 8 and 9 need to be moved in front of Step 5 because the keys need to be created in the directory of the new network.  @pSchlarb 

@iamchirag45 I suggest that you re-run step 5, this time adding on the seed  created the first  time you ran it to the end of each init_indy_node command (so that you don't have to recreate your genesis files) then re-try step 9.
Here are the adjusted commands with the seeds that were generated the first   time you ran them (I got these from the output you shared with us): 
init_indy_node Steward1 0.0.0.0 9701 0.0.0.0 9702 C378fAAAcE9Ba636eABaAAea39c0aD08

init_indy_node Steward2 0.0.0.0 9703 0.0.0.0 9704 2dDAc3EDBdEd3D44aE5ab0E51D597afE

@lynn.bendixsen is correct.  @pSchlarb are you able to make the change to the guide please?
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Thu, 10 Feb 2022 14:28:57 GMT):<br/>
The order is correct in the [Setting up a New Network](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/NewNetwork/NewNetwork.md)
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Thu, 10 Feb 2022 14:44:00 GMT):<br/>
Actually it's not crystal clean there either.

Yes @lynn.bendixsen , it is working fine for me now. I was able to create this network also it will be beneficial to others as well if you can make these changes in that document. and thankyou so much all  @pSchlarb @WadeBarnes @lynn.bendixsen , for the help. I may request for some more help in near future. :sweat_smile:

If we need identity management in Fabric, do we need Indy ledger?
Can we store DIDs / DID Documents in Fabric, so we only need to run a single ledger and utilize verifiable credentials to replace authentication/authorization that is mostly managed by Fabric CA.

Hello, I would like to ask if I want to create an Indy Network, do I have to install from sovrin repos and if I do that will I be connected to Sovrin? Since I want to initiate a closed network.

The short answer to your question is yes.  If you want to run an officially released version of indy-node, you'll need to use the packages from the Sovrin repo.

That does not mean you have to use the Sovrin packages.  You can use the generic Node packages.

`https://repo.sovrin.org/` is where all of the deb packages for the indy projects have been hosted.  With the indy-node 20.04 upgrade we have been moving the indy package hosting over to the Hyperledger repository; https://hyperledger.jfrog.io/ui/repos/tree/General/indy.

The Hyperledger package repository only contains new builds, there are no official releases contained in the Hyperledger repository yet.

Guides to create a new network can be found here; https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/source/NewNetwork/NewNetwork.md

Thank you very much.

<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 11 Feb 2022 13:59:50 GMT):<br/>
Oh, and even if you decide to use the Sovrin packages, that does not mean you'll be connecting to the Sovrin network, it just means you then have access to the token-plugin that is contained in the Sovrin package.

As I see from genesis files node_ip and client_ip of some stewards are same. I looked at Indy Node documents for server requirements and it says 2 public ips for 2 NICs. I guess this is not mandatory for a test network but recommended.
</p>
<p><strong>WadeBarnes</strong> (Fri, 11 Feb 2022 14:06:32 GMT):<br/>
Correct.  That is the current recommendation.  Some stewards joined before that was implemented.

I don't know enough about Fabric to answer how hard that is / if it is a good idea.  Perhaps @troyronda might know better -- he knows the SSI space in general, along with Fabric.
