{"msg":"@bendon that leads into a topic we're pondering about on a project. Here's my take on your question: The DIDs and DDOs that are written to the ledger are immutable (i.e. they can't be changed). That means you need to be able to build your system so it can look at a history and I'll use a Verifiable Claim as an example. Let's say a company was issued a water permit. We have an Issuer (government), an Issuee (the company), and a DDO version of a claim that can be verified as signed by the Issuer and held by the Issuee.

{"msg":"At present, claim revocation is not implemented.\nThere are a few ways to tackle this kind of thing, for different requirements:\n(1) make a claim that such and such was permitted at such and such a time, and then the client side policy is responsible for maximum age. E.g., this company is LEED certified. If the company fails to keep it up, don't re-issue.\n(2) make rotating short-duration claims; again, it is up to the client side policy what to accept. E.g., a passport is fine as ID until expiry, but country XYZ requires it to be valid 6 months after arrival for entry\n(3) have claim issuers available for agents to make claim requests in the moment\n(4) revocation of claims, as yet not implemented.\n\n#1-#2 are like the attribute certificate Push model, and #3 is like OCSP or the attribute certificate Pull model. #4 is not a great fit for claims whose truth values toggle back and forth such as suspension or duty rotation.\n\nNote that there are way more claim definitions available than attributes (because of predicates) and way more attributes than certificates. In this chaos menagerie, each claim can have its own meaning and own freshness/validity in client policy, and so some kind of profile will be advantageous. This effort risks mimicking the generational struggle to define a decent role engineering framework, which in real systems becomes a rat's nest in a hurry.\n\nThe above is a hasty and partial consideration of a difficult and multivariate problem.","username":"sklump","ts":"2017-09-20T11:45:47.867Z"}

{"msg":"Good summaries.  Revocation work has designed and some signs of it are in the code base.  Classic revocation involves a pointer in the claim that a verifier can check to see if the claim is in a list of revoked credentials.  Unfortunately this can expose who has been revoked and when they were revoked.  The accumulator-based revokation approach outlined in the Anoncreds paper instead adds a number on the ledger, that along with a nonrevocation proof allows the holder to prove nonrevocation without disclosing which claim belongs to them.  Mechanically the trickiest part of this revocation scheme is how to replicate the \"tails files\" from the issuer to the holder, as this tails list is usually very large.","username":"nage","ts":"2017-09-20T12:44:27.775Z"}

{"msg":"@Benudek @Sean_Bohan \n\nHow to start working with indy sdk on MacOS (if you have no access to ubuntu or windows environment) with python:\n\n1. Understand that libindy python package is actually a wrapper for the native libindy library. For MacOS we don’t have a binary package and you need to build libindy from source code.\n2. Clone «rc» branch from https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/rc\n3. Build libindy.dylib (native lindy-sdk library) with the following instruction: https://github.com/bdot/indy-sdk/blob/cd0df217fcb4f366143816c8b023410382213c74/doc/mac-build.md\n4. Make sure that processes can load ibindy.dylib. Usually, you need to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH env var looking to the path that contains libindy.dylib (you can find it in libindy/target/debug)\n5. Make sure you have access to Indy Pool. Actually, you have 2 options:\n- Run pool (on 127.0.0.1 ip address) in Docker with https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/rc/ci/indy-pool.dockerfile docker file:\ndocker build -f ci/indy-pool.dockerfile -t indy_pool .\ndocker run -itd -p 9701-9709:9701-9709 indy_pool\nNote that we bind 9701-9709 ports from docker to local ports. I have no direct experience with Docker on Mac, so make sure that it works this way.\n- Use our test pool. See #gid=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xo3Q43TDrrPxwWds7ZtwgPHjU2SfLlMpj9VdKXYck1o/edit#gid=0\n4. Look to python sample: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/rc/samples/python. This sample uses python3-indy package from pypi. Make sure that you use the latest stable version without rc or build number suffixes.\n5. Connection to pool requires genesis txn file that describes some initial nodes transaction. This sample is already pre-configured to work with pool in docker. If you need to connect to the different pool you need to change node transactions in the method «pool_genesis_txn_data» in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/rc/samples/python/src/utils.py file.\n6. This sample explains the main libindy usage workflows. So i suggest to look to main.py and find demos to all API parts.\n\nFor Windows and Ubuntu you can find libindy build instructions here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/README.md. Also, there are pre-built packages for windows and ubuntu in repo: https://repo.evernym.com/libindy. Use stable versions.","username":"gudkov","ts":"2017-09-30T17:03:38.740Z"}

{"msg":"How to start working with indy sdk on MacOS (if you have no access to ubuntu or windows environment) with python:\n\n1. Understand that libindy python package is actually a wrapper for the native libindy library. For MacOS we don’t have a binary package and you need to build libindy from source code.\n2. Clone «rc» branch from https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/rc\n3. Build libindy.dylib (native lindy-sdk library) with the following instruction: https://github.com/bdot/indy-sdk/blob/cd0df217fcb4f366143816c8b023410382213c74/doc/mac-build.md\n4. Make that processes can load ibindy.dylib. Usually, you need to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH env var looking to the path that contains libindy.dylib (you can find it in libindy/target/debug)\n5. Make sure you have access to Indy Pool. Actually, you have 2 options:\n- Run pool (on 127.0.0.1 ip address) in Docker with https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/rc/ci/indy-pool.dockerfile docker file:\ndocker build -f ci/indy-pool.dockerfile -t indy_pool .\ndocker run -itd -p 9701-9709:9701-9709 indy_pool\nNote that we bind 9701-9709 ports from docker to local ports. I have no direct experience with Docker on Mac, so make sure that it works this way.\n- Use our test pool. See #gid=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xo3Q43TDrrPxwWds7ZtwgPHjU2SfLlMpj9VdKXYck1o/edit#gid=0\n4. Look to python sample: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/rc/samples/python. This sample uses python3-indy package from pypi. Make sure that you use the latest stable version without rc or build number suffixes.\n5. Connection to pool requires genesis txn file that describes some initial nodes transaction. This sample is already pre-configured to work with pool in docker. If you need to connect to the different pool you need to change node transactions in the method «pool_genesis_txn_data» in https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/rc/samples/python/src/utils.py file.\n6. This sample explains the main libindy usage workflows. So i suggest to look to main.py and find demos to all API parts.\n\nFor Windows and Ubuntu you can find libindy build instructions here: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/README.md. Also, there are pre-built packages for windows and ubuntu in repo: https://repo.evernym.com/libindy. Use stable versions. ","username":"Benudek","ts":"2017-09-30T20:32:12.654Z"}

{"msg":"@swcurran beyond Alex’s question, it is a good idea to expect agent interactions to take time and be asynchronous.  This allows agents to tolerate downtime, making them more resilient in important ways, but also allows the humans behind them to stay involved with permissioning and authorizing responses where it is important to them.  I know that isn’t really directly related to your question, but from a philosophy perspective the ideal would enable two agents on bad “remote location” connections to interact without timeouts and intermittent connectivity preventing any progress (it would be slow and painful, but the hope is it would still work)","username":"nage","ts":"2017-10-09T12:43:13.172Z"}

{"msg":"Reading the Alice scenario in the Getting Started guide I ran up against a question that I haven't been able to find an answer too.  In the guide it says, \"Trust anchors provide a way for DIDs to be added to to the ledger. They are generally organizations but can be persons as well. Faber College is a trust anchor, and if its connection request is accepted, will write Alice’s DID to the ledger.\"  So from what I've been reading, only Validator Nodes can write to the ledger and they are run by the stewards on the network.  If this wording means that Fabor is a Trust Anchor and Trust Anchor = Steward, then enough said.  But if not, I'm curious to know the flow from Faber knowing that they have a DID to write to the ledger and it actually getting written to the ledger.

Or are requests to Validator Nodes load balanced in some way so that the request could potentially be handled by any of the Validator Nodes?","username":"aaronr","ts":"2017-11-07T19:04:44.889Z"}
{"msg":"@aaronr - You are right that only validator nodes can write to the ledger, which they themselves maintain.  This is the nature of distributed ledgers.  Such writes are done only when consensus is achieved among validator nodes, with 2/3 * N +1 of the validators agreeing to the transaction.\n\nWhat triggers the transaction?  A request to the validator pool, via a client or an agent.  All such requests must be signed by the requesting party.  The signature is verified by the validators, and if the signature matches the DID and verification key of someone who is already on the ledger, who has a role that is sufficient to authorize that the transaction be placed onto the ledger, then the validators will perform the write.\n\nA trust anchor is a role that has sufficient privileges to sign a transaction to place a customer's DID onto the ledger.","username":"mgbailey","ts":"2017-11-07T21:42:48.041Z"}

All of the Verifiable Claim data that is exchanged may be held by the Issuers (as they see fit), and the Holder - usually the individual about which claims has been made.  So a citizen would be holding claims they have received. What the police could do about that data is presumably up to the police in the jurisdiction of the citizen.\n\nThe advantage over the current model is that the issuer (an online service, for example) need not hold onto the data that was used to identify the user.  For example, they need not hold the name and address of the person locally - if they need that data, they can request it from the user.

{"msg":"[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=9qBZ6JSy9BYSinZcW) @swcurran While it's true that network participants _need not_ directly examine PII data, these data have to exist _somewhere_, and we cannot expect _every_ scrap of data from driver's licence to medical records to be stored on a customer's mobile device. There is also \"current state\" to be considered; which is to say the transitional period any municipality / region / country needs to go through when bringing such an SSI system online, in porting silo'd data \"somewhere else\".\n\nI envisage that there will be a decidely long time (~10y+) where current data silo's containing yours and my PII data persist within organisations who are simulateneously SSI system participants. We cannot expect with all the wherewithal in the world, that _all_ data from _all_ participating agencies' silos are ported to devices or hardware wallets or other \"trusted\" 3rd parties. \n\nTaking this as predicate then; it follows that such (toxic) data is still accessible by said agencies using standard processes such as intranet applications as executables, web-based query tools or whatever. The one saving grace being that in a SSI network context, assuming such \"standard\" (legacy) query methods are howsoever used, the claims data and silo'd PII data cannot be correlated.","username":"theruss","ts":"2017-11-27T17:31:10.671Z","attachments":[{"message_link":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=9qBZ6JSy9BYSinZcW","url":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=9qBZ6JSy9BYSinZcW","remote":true,"fileId":null,"fileName":null}]}
{"msg":" @theruss - I think we are agreeing.  The bulk of the data will remain with the service, but the data that can correlate it back to the users (that which makes it useful for illicit action) will NOT be stored with that bulk of data, but will remain in the control of the user.\n\nThe speed of this will depend on the ease of the transition and the motivation to change. Rules like GDPR and hacks like Equifax will drive the stick motivation, and good software will provide the carrot. Go Sovrin!!\n\nOne other factor makes the data less useful in an SSI-world. When it becomes \"normal\" that the only PII data accepted is that backed by a Verifiable Claim, then PII data in the wild becomes much less valuable. If you can't use a SSN as plain-text, but only as a Verifiable Claim, then having millions of SSNs will be much less valuable.  I think this will take longer than de-toxifying enterprise data, but when it arrives it will be huge help in restricting the current type of break-ins we are seeing.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2017-11-27T17:41:48.365Z"}

In that case, you would want to be a Trust Anchor, as you will be onboarding end users by writing to the network. You would not have to be a Steward - that would be a choice you would have.  You could also write software that enables an organization to be \"Sovrin-Enabled\" - to allow a Service (bank, college) to interact with Sovrin.  Again, the likely scenario is the operator of the Service running your app (e.g. the bank) would be Trust Anchor. We're building that type of component.\n\nIn the Alice example, none of the organizations (Faber, etc.) are Stewards, because they don't operate the nodes of the network.  The Stewards are unnamed in that example (just IP addresses), but they are the 4 (in the example) processes that are running the Ledger. The agents are writing to the Ledger (by sending messages to one or more of the nodes) and the nodes are doing the blockchain operations - distributing transactions, creating updates to the ledger, reaching consensus on the evolving state of the Ledger. Note that the claims are NOT written to the ledger - they are signed using the keys that are referenced on the ledger, but the claims and proofs are shared between the identities - e.g. Faber to Alice, Alice to Acme, etc.\n\nOn your assumption - XYZ need not be a Steward, but would be Trust Anchor.  Again - from an interacting with the Sovrin Ledger - you only need to be a Trust Anchor. You can be a Steward, but it's not necessary.\n\n\n","username":"swcurran","ts":"2017-12-08T17:05:10.819Z"}

{"msg":"Hello everyone, a quick question:","username":"charyorde","ts":"2017-12-29T11:51:28.128Z"}
{"msg":"As it stands today, Can identities running on Indy be referenced in Fabric blockchain (like in a smart contract)?","username":"charyorde","ts":"2017-12-29T11:51:37.421Z"}
{"msg":"Also, is it possible to use Indy as bitcoin and Ether Wallet? I want to maintain Bitcoin Wallet and Ether Wallet as Indy identities.","username":"charyorde","ts":"2017-12-29T12:34:43.196Z"}

{"msg":"If you are looking for working code of either example, I'm pretty sure the answer is no. I'm not aware of either.  \n\nThe first is presumably possible, since a reference to an Indy ID is a reference to a DID, which is an extended instance of a URN (see the DID spec - https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/). So to be used in a Fabric smart contract, there would need to be in Fabric the ability to reference a DID (easy - it's a string) and reference the related identity - trickier - must interact with an instance of HL-Indy, such as Sovrin.  It's not really an Indy thing, although presumably as this becomes real, there will be some Indy effort put forth.\n\nThe second I'd have to think about. Not sure about how an Indy key could be related to a Bitcoin wallet. It's an interesting use case.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2017-12-29T18:14:11.407Z"}

Do I setup\nfour nodes (as a Alice demo) and use some API (of which I have no idea where) to programmatically\nadd these people to the Sovrin network? I assume I would know the DIDs afterward.\nThen I can run a test program to check if they are there.

Certainly each granduate would not on their own add themselves but the University\ncertainly would use the public resource to provide public information about a graduate without investing in resources\nout of their pocket. The University has an obligation to the graduate to assist in proving they graduated to those\nthat need to know. Sovrin it is a decentralized public repository for information and hence this is perfect for the\nUniversity to use without financial internal resources needed.\n\nThis scenario from the Sovrin Trusted Anchor can certainly flush out things, such as an API that works to\nadd Entities programmatically from a Trusted source that has done the obligation of vetting legally the owner\nto be added.\n\nOr maybe I am wrong about a Sovrin Trusted Anchor, but the reality is, there has to be an end to end\nsample for an Institution which already has an obligation to vet owners legally with public information of\nthat owner that the institution is obligated to prove graduation (Degree) for the benefit of the owner.\n","username":"redpath","ts":"2018-01-26T15:00:36.035Z"}

{"msg":"Hi there,\n\nOne question that I've been getting asked when explaining Self-sovereign identity is how can a verifier be confident that an issuer has performed proper checks to issue a claim for a user.\n\nThis level of assurance question is particularly important for usecases where legislation's require organisations to have a high level of confidence that the users they interact with are who they claim to be.\n\nFor example, AML (anti-money laundering) legislation in my country requires organisations to follow strict procedures (such as non-photographic identification + driver license) for onboarding and performing 'high-risk' transactions. \nIf a user was to transfer large sum of money, they would have to bring their verifying documents to the bank and be verified for AML purposes.\n\nSelf-sovereign Identity can streamline a lot of these issues. For example, once a user is given a verified claim he/she can use that claim to verify the transfer of large funds from their account.\nA user is no longer required to go to the bank and provide proof of their ID again and again.\n\nThe only issue is that organisations need to have a high-level of confidence that the issuer of a claim has performed the necessary checks, with respect to the current legislation, to provide the claim and that the claim is up-to-date.\n\nReading the newly released whitepaper, it seems that insurers could provide a solution to this problem? Is there documentation that describes how insurers work in detail?\nDo you have any opinions on how to solve this problem?\n","username":"Harmannz","ts":"2018-02-19T19:59:16.925Z"}
{"msg":"@Harmannz it is an important and totally relevant question. The answer is not a technical one but a process one. The assurance level of a claim is related to the processes by which the claim was issued. This should generally be the domain of a trust framework. \n\nIn Canada we are working on a Pan Canadian Trust Framework (https://diacc.ca/pan-canadian-trust-framework/) which would be an example of such a framework. The main point is to have a set of common processes and conformance criteria that issuers (in our case government identity issuers) follow and comply with such that the claims they issue can be considered trusted and used within and across jurisdictions for services that require stronger levels of assurance.\n\nThere could be other mechanisms such as insurers as well I would imagine.","username":"jljordan_bcgov","ts":"2018-02-20T01:06:01.490Z"}
{"msg":" @jljordan_bcgov  Thanks for your reply. You are right. I was trying to avoid mentioning trust framework to see if Indy authors are planning to introduce any mechanisms to make this easier.\nA trust framework is something we are currently investigating, but developing it will require collaboration from multiple public and private sector organisations which may be the next step for us. \nRealistically, there isn't really a need for insurers if there is a trust framework in place and all participating parties are legally bound to it.\n \nI have been following the Pan Canadian Trust Framework and I am interested to see how the final document will look like. \nI have read the Verified Person Component (https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF). \nDo you guys have a timeline on when the PCTF will be publically available?","username":"Harmannz","ts":"2018-02-20T04:10:15.645Z"}

{"msg":"Hi everyone @here. I've felt for a long time that Indy's community should grow faster and deeper. One crucial step in community growth is to have good documentation, which helps onboarding of new users. I got fed up with Indy's documentation being scattered and outdated at times, so I decided to take example from our distributed brothers at Fabric & Corda. They have taken use of \"Read the Docs\" / Sphinx for documentation.\n\nI've created a starting point for creating better Indy/Sovrin documentation. I've just created a structure for now, but the plan would be to incorporate all the documentation created thus far and curate it into the documentation structure so that it would serve new users as well as the developers working on indy/Sovrin. \n\nTo avoid any overlapping initiatives, I'd like to get a) info if anybody else is working on similar things and b) your feedback on what would be a useful structure. \nAlso, I'd be interested to know, if Hyperledger has a logical place to host this documentations, or should it rather be at sovrin.org?

I apologize for addressing these questions so late (1 day before application deadline), but I wanted to provide a little clarification. First, the goal of the IPython Notebooks is to build short use cases similar to the \"getting started\" guide which will walk people through understand concepts in Hyperledger Indy, and show some basic use cases such as how to create, manage, and update a DID. We ideally would like to see a candidate be able to create their own use cases for this in the application and the project would involve actual implementation of this with the help of your mentors. For the DID-Auth work, we are still in discussions as to what this project will look like, but ideally this will become a replacement to traditional authentication (username/passwords) or integrate with systems that are familiar (OAuth/SSO). DID-Auth is an integral idea that is in process, so we would expect for you to be first get an understanding of the ideas, and build upon the current implementations that have been completed.

This concept has already been vetted by Evernym and we collectively believe that we’re looking at a game-changer in the world of data analytics. \n\nCreating a Sovrin-linked public permissionless ledger and accompanying cloud based data warehousing solution to store GDPR-compliant data tables aligned to Sovrin-built “ghost\" schemas would enable developers to build algorithms and decentralised applications on pre-verified data without compromising self-sovereign identity. \n\nImagine the benefit to a postdoctoral researcher conducting research for a groundbreaking thesis or enabling a startup company to build industry-specific algorithmic automation processes to better serve their community.\n\nAll data stored in the schema-related data tables would already be verified by trusted stewards on the Sovrin platform.\n\nThe linked ledger would aim to become the preferred DLT platform for worldwide societal analytics and applications. \n\nProgrammers, coders and developers would be able to build open source statistics and analytics applications for societal, corporate and personal benefit. \n\nThe concept deck has been drafted and I’m now bringing it to the Hyperledger Indy community to see what people think. \n\nThis new proposed build would need to be built methodically and with real expert input from now until final implementation. \n\nFrom Evernym: \"Hi Paul - this is starting to look good. My suggestion for progression is for you to get involved in the Sovrin community at sovrin.slack.com, or in the Hyperledger Indy rocketchat. You've got an all encompassing vision so when you introduce it to the community you might want to go back up to 50,000 feet to articulate the problem you're trying to solve, and see what people think.”\n\nThe working title of the concept deck … \"Building a Linked Public Permissionless Ledger - 'the future of data analytics’ \"\n\nPlease get back to me, if you're interested to hear more.","username":"pknowles","ts":"2018-03-26T11:13:10.838Z"}

{"msg":"Hi All, pretty new to Indy, require a quick clarification or feedback on the thought while using Indy","username":"Susmit","ts":"2018-04-27T09:47:02.818Z"}
{"msg":"Indy seems more a DLT rather to a blockchain to hold data and share it. Still one can store the truth (i.e. hash) in blockchain and actual data safe in Indy’s wallet for sharing.","username":"Susmit","ts":"2018-04-27T09:47:13.160Z"}
{"msg":"Something like using Fabric +Indy together","username":"Susmit","ts":"2018-04-27T09:47:59.974Z"}
{"msg":"any views on the thought will be great","username":"Susmit","ts":"2018-04-27T09:49:20.716Z"}
{"msg":"@Susmit Indy is indeed a DLT for decentralized identity. Note that by *by itself* is it not designed to share identity data. Rather it is designed to hold the decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and DID documents containing the public keys and agent endpoints of the parties to a digital relationship (called a connection). Those parties can then exchang verifiable credentials to establish trust.","username":"drummondreed","ts":"2018-04-30T00:19:26.549Z"}
{"msg":"So as a identity utility, Indy can really be used by any other application or system that needs decentralized identity, very much like any Web application can use DNS (this is not to say that Indy serves the same purpose as DNS—it's just an analogy).","username":"drummondreed","ts":"2018-04-30T00:21:19.562Z"}
{"msg":"Certainly other blockchain applications based on Fabric that need identity can use Indy, so indeed I anticipate Fabric + Indy will be a common pattern.","username":"drummondreed","ts":"2018-04-30T00:22:19.510Z"}

{"msg":"@sudomann Yes, the simple way to put it is that Sovrin is a global public utility for self-sovereign identity in which all the validators of the Sovrin public ledger run Indy-Node and all the hosts of private identity agents run Indy-SDK (or the equivalent). For full details on Sovrin, see the Sovrin white paper: https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-protocol-and-token-white-paper.","username":"drummondreed","ts":"2018-04-30T04:27:33.065Z"}

The short answer, using GDPR terminology, is that if a data subject shares data with a data controller using pairwise pseudonymous DIDs (which is the default in the Sovrin ecosystem), then the data subject can always: a) send a deletion request to the data controller via the private encrypted DID channel to delete any shared data, and b) revoke the pairwise pseudonymous DID assigned to the data controller.

{"msg":"@StanleyChen - you pretty much have the process.  BC Gov sponsored some work that have now been moved to DIF that implement a couple of these - for example: https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-auth-extension which is the closest to the website use case you are talking about.  There was some preliminary discussion at the recent IIW conference to merge DID-Auth with FIDO2.\n\nOne thing about your use case to keep in mind.  A DID (or more specifically, a DID Doc) can be updated for key rotation (e.g. replacing a compromised keypair).  That should be a signal to the other side to recheck the verifiable credentials, as that mechanism can be used to transfer ownership of the DID to another identity (which is OK - just be aware of it).  As well, VerCreds may have a lifespan, and a service may (depending on its verification needs) want to re-verify the VerCreds from time to time.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2018-05-25T19:54:08.513Z"}

{"msg":"To indy experts  \nSome history\nThe Hyperledger T & E WG approved June 4th the following: \"Proposed transaction: Let us select the 15 most essential concepts (is not terms) in Fabric, Sawtooth, Burrow and Iroha, and describe clearly, using illustrating relevant examples, understandable to end users and management, how they relate, overlap and where they are different; look forward to endorsements.\"\n\nOn behalf of the WG I submit to you the first two concepts descriptions: A blockchain is an append-only data structure; a blockchain (instance) consists at any moment in time of a number of blocks. A block contains a number of transactions. The contents of a block is encrypted and each block contains a hash of major parts. It contains also a copy of the hash of the previous block and this is the reason for the term chain. A transaction proposal is a proposal by a client application or administrator to the blockchain network community. The network community can decide to make the transaction proposal a valid transaction, or is classified as an invalid transaction. Please let us know which improvements you want to make to these two concept definitions. Thanks\nCurrent situation\n•\tSjirNijssen 19:44 \n@KellyCooper @roleybrown @amundson @dan @yacovm @tkuhrt and members of the Training & Education WG, The feedback of amundson is incorporated, as well as Dan's and Tracy's. The feedback of yacov about the concept hash has hastened the introduction of concepts lists per audience; the feedback of Yacov was probably directed towards computer scientists or software engineers and I did not want to go that deep for decision makers and end users. So yacovm when we move up through the six audiances you suggestions will there get additional space. \nThe response to the first two concept definitions has been encouraging. As a result there are now in the second increment 8 concept definitions. The proposal has been extended to make the concept list specific for 6 audiances, decision makers and end users, blockchain architects and blockchain consultants, admins, client application developers, smart contract developers and Hyperledger Platform developers. Everyone is invited to add his suggestions at https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/training-and-education/list-of-blockchain-core-concepts Thanks for your help. Please consider the list of 8 definitions and let us know whether we need to give additional attention to Indy concepts; your suggestions are very welcome.

{"msg":"Hi, I'm interested in using Indy to build a decentralized credit registry. Each client and institution can have a DID for that relationship, and each credit attestation can be a verifiable claim (eg took out a loan for $100 on Jan 1, paid back $5 on Feb 2, etc). What's different about credit claims vs other claims is when the client goes to show these claims to a verifier (eg a credit bureau or other bank) they can't just present their good claims and leave out the bad ones (eg defaults), the verifier needs proof that they are seeing all claims issued for that relationship. One way to solve this to calculate the merkle root of all the claims and store it on the blockchain. This merkle root will then get updated as each new claim is issued (a similar solution described by W3C https://web-payments.org/specs/source/pop2016/). The verifier can then build up a merkle tree from all the claims submitted and if the merkle root doesn't match the one on the blockchain then they will know the subject left some out. Is this a good approach to the problem? Theoretically this per-DID merkle root could be stored on any blockchain but it would be easiest if it was stored right on the Indy blockchain. Is there a way to do this now? If not what would I need to change to implement it? The ideal solution would be if this all happened automatically, ie if a client & issuer ever established DID relationship of type 'merkle-claims' (or something) then when any claim was issued it would automatically update Indy's blockchain key-value store (where the key would be the DID and the value the merkle root of all claims issued).","username":"jacobsaur","ts":"2018-07-12T20:21:05.467Z"}

That can be found in the docs directory of hyperledger/indy-node and hyperledger/indy-plenum. Second, because we do not store any data on the ledger, I don't think your idea of storing a merkle roots on the ledger would work well in this case. Rather, claims would be stored in agents and if anyone wanted a record they would need to ask the payer for a copy of the claims and they could generate a proof to show that they've made the payments based upon the claims that the institution issued to them as a receipt of payment.

That can be found in the docs directory of hyperledger/indy-node and hyperledger/indy-plenum. Second, because we do not store any data on the ledger, I don't think your idea of storing a merkle roots on the ledger would work well in this case. Rather, claims would be stored in agents and if anyone wanted a record they would need to ask the payer for a copy of the claims and they could generate a proof to show that they've made the payments based upon the claims that the institution issued to them as a receipt of payment. Hopefully that helps a little in understanding better what you had in mind and feel free to ask more questions if you need. Please @ me though so I can get back to you with a response.","username":"kdenhartog","ts":"2018-07-13T20:25:00.600Z","attachments":[{"message_link":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=GDZ6dDbeRHj2oqutG","url":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=GDZ6dDbeRHj2oqutG","remote":true,"fileId":null,"fileName":null}]}

{"msg":"@kdenhartog thanks for your response! Just to check my understanding, I thought that Indy did store some things on a public ledger, such as DIDs and credential schemas. For my use case I would just need a public consensus driven key-value store which it seems like plenum supports at least under the hood (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum/blob/master/storage/kv_store_leveldb.py). One other thought I had was that the value for the merkle root could be stored as DID metadata (using sdk function setDidMetadata) since there should only ever be one merkle root for all claims associated with a DID. But I can't tell whether this would only update DID metadata in the users wallet or whether it would update it on the public ledger.  ","username":"jacobsaur","ts":"2018-07-14T00:32:33.703Z"}

One of the main reasons. Take note, no actual data that is signed in claims, or even hashes end up on the ledger. This is important to the data model because this means if an encryption scheme or a hash scheme we're ever able to be broken, all of this data could be cracked later on.

However, I do believe you could make a workaround to make your use case fit using Indy, but I wouldn't suggest it as you're introducing assumptions that we haven't made and I think it will become very messy quickly. If having the data exist on a ledger is absolutely necessary, I'd suggest looking at finding a way to use Indy as an identity layer with a Fabric ledger rather than trying to make Indy work in a way it wasn't intended.","username":"kdenhartog","ts":"2018-07-14T05:58:57.737Z","attachments":[{"message_link":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=ooWbeeTrzGmc5i7td","url":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=ooWbeeTrzGmc5i7td","remote":true,"fileId":null,"fileName":null}]}

Linux, perhaps?\n\nCan you check the line-endings of the file \"TheOrgBook/tob-api/openshift/python-libindy/s2i/bin/assemble\"?  I suspect that they have Windows CRLF line endings vs. just LF that you need.  You can use instructions here to look at that: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3569997/how-to-find-out-line-endings-in-a-text-file.  You might want to check the other files in the same directory.  If so, I suspect the s2i is trying to run \"/bin/bash<CR>\" instead of \"/bin/bash\" - which makes sense.

{"msg":"Hello, I have a question regarding the Onboarding process described in the example case study  \"https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/doc/getting-started/getting-started.md\", under point number 11 please.  \n\nFor convenience, the relevant excerpt is: \"Faber anonymously encrypts the connection response by calling crypto.anon_crypt with the Steward verkey. The Anonymous-encryption schema is designed for the sending of messages to a Recipient which has been given its public key. Only the Recipient can decrypt these messages, using its private key. While the Recipient can verify the integrity of the message, it cannot verify the identity of the Sender.\" \n\nMy question is: what is the protection against someone (for eg, a MITM) who pretends to be Faber and submits its own DID,VerKey pair (instead of Faber's) as connection response to Steward?

{"msg":"@marrowdev @x1990 - I agree with what was said above about agent communications and the methods to prevent compromise. However, there is another key thing to keep in mind in this ecosystem.  A connection alone should not be trusted - it merely establishing a communication channel between two identities. The use of Verifiable Credentials should be used after the connection is established to determine if you should trust the Identity for the purposes of the connection. Thus, if a MITM attack could occur, the connection might be established, but the attacker could not prove, for example, that the Identity is John Smith as issued by the DMV (e.g. on their Driver's Licence) to them and that their TaxID is XXXXXX as issued by the Federal Government to them (if that information is needed). Just knowing that data is no longer enough - you have to be able to prove who issued it to you.\n\nVCs are the key for establishing the necessary level of trust for continuing with the relationship.  Note as well that the verification can (and should) be both ways - Alice must prove with VCs who she is to Faber, and Faber must prove with VCs to Alice who it is. It is a peer-to-peer relationship.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2018-08-10T16:43:45.587Z"}

Some other systems only support proving Credentials, which means you lose selective disclosure (only disclosing a subset of claims in a Credential) and ZKPs - e.g. the use of predicates.

We discounted D as not having the momentum we wanted.

{"msg":"@ShivVenkatraman - the bigger performance hit for revocation occurs at Credential Definition Creation time, so it's a one time cost.  The more credentials you plan to issue, the longer it will take.  The next longest time, which will not be long, is creating the proof.  The verifier just has to review the Proof and verify that the \"Proof of non-Revocation\" is sufficiently recent.   Note that the number of credentials that can be issued is set at Credential Definition creation time - a new Cred Def may have to be created if you run out.\n\nFYI - we found the Cred Def with revocation took a REALLY long time to create when the code has DEBUG turned off.  Without that, it's relatively fast.  Still takes awhile - lots of crypto-math - but not intolerable for a one time event. ","username":"swcurran","ts":"2018-09-26T01:12:02.150Z"}

Thus, if a single claim changed, you would revoke the current credential, and issue a new one.

Now if this leader was ordering txns in the batch in an unfair manner, it will lose some performance and might get replaced. \nThere are other protocols like HoneyBadger where users send encrypted txns so nodes cannot do favouritism.

Further, even if there is no microledger (every DID must be written to the global, public ledger), a connection request does not automatically result in a connection acceptance that creates a DID. You only end up creating a DID when the connection is accepted. Now, if every client decides to accept all connection requests and then evaluate whether they're desirable, after the fact, then the potential for spam exists as you have imagined it.

{"msg":"[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=2u9E9Nd5GR84oJ3tQ) @arunwij Arun: the assumption is that issuers don't give credentials unless they have some reason to do so--and that this reason includes some basis for trust. If the credential is issued by a bank, then the person receiving the credential is likely a bank customer, and the bank has policies and procedures in place to identify their customer and decide what their customer's attributes are. For example, the bank probably has a secure website where its customers can login and receive a credential. Similarly, if the issuer is an educational institution, it knows its students and has some sort of secure communication mechanism with them. Or if the issuer is a government, it knows its citizens and has some mechanism for determining whether it should issue credentials to them.\n\nThe scenario you seem to be focusing on is one that seems extremely unlikely to me: two parties who have never interacted in any way want to begin their association by having one give the other a credential. Why would that ever be useful? What seems far more likely to me is that two parties who have never interacted create a relationship and then, AFTER trust accumulates in that relationship, one of the parties gives the other a credential on the basis of the trust that has accumulated. For example, two parties that do not know one another conduct some business on eBay--and the resulting credential states that party A was a good customer for party B. It cannot state that party A has a known name or bank balance, since the relationship never involved evidence of those things--but it can state that A paid promptly and was pleasant to work with, and used a particular eBay username.","username":"danielhardman","ts":"2018-10-29T17:26:24.307Z","attachments":[{"message_link":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=2u9E9Nd5GR84oJ3tQ","url":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=2u9E9Nd5GR84oJ3tQ","remote":true,"fileId":null,"fileName":null}]}
{"msg":"[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=8QXe4RayAPgzFm5jp) @zixian5 The SDK uses the genesis transactions file to contact some of the original nodes in the validator pool. It then asks those nodes if any new nodes have been added. If the answer is yes, then the original nodes from the validator pool prove that the new nodes were added according to correct rules of consensus, and supplies the contact information for the additional nodes. This is a process called \"catchup\", and it results in client code having an accurate idea of which validator nodes are currently canonical for the pool.\n\nAfter this is done, the client code then sends a read or write request to multiple validator nodes. Which nodes it picks is not under client control. This is a security design choice. We assume that one or more of the validator nodes could be malicious (attempt to lie to a client). Therefore the client randomly contacts several of them (enough so that at least one of them is not malicious).\n\nThe nodes process the transaction request, and provide a reply. The reply has to be signed by multiple nodes, such that any single node cannot forge a response--only a response backed by genuine consensus is legitimate.\n\nCommunication between clients and nodes currently uses ZMQ technology.\n\nDid this answer your question?","username":"danielhardman","ts":"2018-10-29T17:33:15.173Z","attachments":[{"message_link":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=8QXe4RayAPgzFm5jp","url":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=8QXe4RayAPgzFm5jp","remote":true,"fileId":null,"fileName":null}]}

Then you decide if you are OK with that. \nFrom Me to Everyone: (11:59 AM)\n I think I heard that, I guess my question would be how do you dynamically change the security context you’d like over time? \nFrom Matthew Hailstone to Everyone: (11:59 AM)\n If that’s the case, then the implementation of unpack needs to determine how safe the message is or based on current cryptography schemes and their current state determine whether the message is trusted (or other context states). \nFrom Matthew Hailstone to Everyone: (12:01 PM)\n I’m recommending that the determination of the trust context be something that is statically built into the version of the indy-sdk/unpack/pack functions and that updates to the indy-sdk would update how unpack determines the trust context. \nFrom Me to Everyone: (12:01 PM)\n Matthew, semi-related - Message trust entirely based on crypto and security is good, but seems not like the silver bullet - I think message trust along with reputation of those connecting (and over time) is the combination that solves this issue\n``` ","username":"haggs","ts":"2018-11-08T17:09:14.325Z"}

{"msg":"Second, in your scenario, you are introducing the idea that a verifiable credential (a Purchase Order) can itself be a Sovrin Entity. That's a cool concept that I haven't seen modeled much yet. However I don't think it changes the basic roles. Acme Org is the Issuer because the P.O. is from Acme Org, not from Alice. Alice, acting as a Delegate of the Issuer, triggers the issuance of the P.O. as a VC. Since the P.O. is to Bobbles Org, I believe Bobbles.Org is both the Holder and the Verifier.

{"msg":"@mwherman2000 - an interesting use case. I'd be interested in participating in a discussion in Basel about it.  Keep me in the loop.\n\nOne way we've been thinking about the design of Credentials is determining how the holder of the Verifiable Credential would have to use it - what would they need to prove and to whom?  In thinking about it that way, are all of the Facts in the use case VCs? Perhaps, but I'm not certain at the level I've gone through it. Something to consider.\n\nOn the Issuer/Holder question - I think that in general, the role of Alice and Bob are indeed as delegates of Acme and Bobbles, respectively, and so Acme/Bobbles are the likely Issuers/Holders of the VCs. The delegate relationship is (current implementation at least) still informally defined but as these more complex use cases get implemented, it will crystalize. It will be extremely common.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2018-11-29T07:26:32.291Z"}

For example on a single DID I may have multiple TRUST_ANCHORS signatures. I believe something along the lines was mentioned A+B+C:D","username":"Francis-Guttridge","ts":"2018-12-05T19:48:31.319Z"}

{"msg":"The SGF V2 in turn lays the groundwork for what we call the  Sovrin Web of Trust Model. This is a globally scalable formal web of trust model based on DIDS and verifiable credentials. It defines four main classes of issuers in terms of escalating strength-of-trust: Peer, Trust Anchor, Trust Hub, Governance Authority. All the roles are optional, i.e., any trust community can assemble the roles it needs to serve its purposes. For any Proof received by a Verifier, the Verifier can walk the trust chain up as far as that particular chain goes, i.e., if the Proof is from a Peer, does the Peer have a Proof from a Trust Anchor? Does the Trust Anchor have a Proof from a Trust Hub? Does the Trust Hub have a Proof from a Governance Authority? Governance Authorities publish what we call domain-specific governance frameworks, so they are the real backbones of trust, and under this model there can be tens of thousands of them and they can cross-certify to form a true global web of trust.","username":"drummondreed","ts":"2018-12-09T05:45:56.452Z"}

{"msg":"[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=FmjTyCiC2b7priJWP) I disagree—not because @mtfk does not have a point, but because there's a different way to look at it. A DID is *by definition* decentralized. But a DIRL (see note below RE naming) actually DOES define the location of a resource. Using a simplified pseudocode: DIRL = DID + ServiceID + ResourceID (the actual syntax is did:method:specificid;serviceid/path?query#frag where every component except did:method:specificid is optional). So what happens is that while the DID is decentralized (by design), the ServiceID component maps the DIRL to a specific service endpoint URL—which *is* a resource locator—and then adds the optional path?query#fragment components which at that point *are* also resource locators.","username":"drummondreed","ts":"2018-12-16T12:40:40.234Z","attachments":[{"message_link":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=FmjTyCiC2b7priJWP","url":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=FmjTyCiC2b7priJWP","remote":true,"fileId":null,"fileName":null}]}

Decentralize identifier is something which should serve in any use case is very generic and fits very well in multiple cases (for example by simply changing main context of DID Doc). The problem is that in the current implementation/spec is tied to the public key. If we would like to use DID for something else then unit of control like schema (unit of language) we entering very dangers space as we are mixing control with language.  We had multiple discussions during HL Global Forum about that problem end even that I am not fully understand all consequences yet I kind of got the point. I think is very important to distinguishes between DID as a unit of control from the rest use cases where not necessary we want to tied to someone key. Language (schema + overlays) are good example were nobody should have control over that what we can or can't speak about.

{"msg":"Hi everyone, I have a question regarding `plugins`. As far as I've seen in `indy-plenum` documentation there is a possibility to extend the set of ledgers and transactions with the help of plugins. I have 2 questions: 1) Does the mechanism described for `indy-plenum` works for `indy-node`. Is there any differences in implementation of plugins? 2) If the plugin is used to add some additional transaction, how I can send such a transaction from `indy-sdk`? Is there a way to write plugin for `indy-sdk` or the only way would be to fork and expand the functionality in the code? Any replies or hints would be highly appreciated","username":"dnnn","ts":"2018-12-17T16:25:31.950Z"}

However, getting a TA to do that for requires \"proving\" in the social sense who you are and what you are planning to do.  This will become solidified over time based on the Sovrin Gov Framework.

{"msg":"Hi all :-) . I have this use case : the user get a \"earning credential\" with its salary from its employer. He provide to the bank, a proof including this data (earning). The bank want to know when the user earning has changed. What is the best way to update the proof for the bank ? Is it possible ? Can the issuer update a credential ? Does the bank need to request regularly a new proof ? ..... Thanks for you solution or idea :-) ","username":"xnopre","ts":"2018-12-21T10:58:19.300Z"}
{"msg":"[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=SBHW9mns3QHJfmxMp) @xnopre So, in answering your question I will quote from a very interesting paper that the German Blockchain Association published 23 October 2018 which I am just making my way through today ... https://jolocom.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Self-sovereign-Identity-_-Blockchain-Bundesverband-2018.pdf ... so far I would recommend it as a great overview of SSI.\n\n``` It is important to say that the exchange of claims happens in a peer-to-peer manner and the Holder is always one of the peers to the interaction. No information is exchanged outside the Holder’s control, a principle that is ensured by storing the Claims under the Holder’s control and requiring cryptographic signatures for each interaction, based on keys only the Holder can access and control.```\n\nSo there are a few different aspects to your questions I will address individually.\n\nIf the bank wants to know if the earnings have changed .. they must ask the holder of the credential (employee/customer) via a proof request. As per the paragraph quoted above, this is a fundamental design intent of an SSI system. The holder MUST be involved. \n\nNow, this could be perhaps automated, perhaps when the employee/bank customer agreed to receive a loan from the bank they also consented to answering earnings update requests from the bank every X period of time. This request may be manually handled by the employee/bank customer or perhaps the tell their persistent agent to automatically respond to these proof requests from the bank. This is a business/design decision.\n\nCan the issuer (employer) update a credential. Technically they can not \"update\" a credential. What they can do is issue a new credential and revoke the previous one. Credentials could also include expiry dates that would offer verifiers a way to ask for \"current\" credentials. As well, credentials likely will have an issuance date (I think that is a good idea in general) so verifiers can request that claim in a proof request to see how \"fresh\" the claim is.\n\nNow, all that being said I can promote/test the waters on an upcoming feature of the coming Hyperledger Indy Catalyst's Credential Registry component (aka OrgBook https://orgbook.gov.bc.ca is an example) ... This feature will allow verifiers to subscribe (via a webhook) to an organization page or a credential page so they can be notified of changes such as a legal name change, the issuance of a new permit, the change in legal status of an organization, etc. Now this is only possible when it is ok to have a multi-subject holder (subjects in this case being legal entities). Since we are using public open data that is ok .. we would NOT, at least in our jurisdiction, see this as a pattern for personal data.\n\nThe use cases for Hyperledger Indy Catalyst's Credential Registry component are for these kinds of public collections of accreditations. For example, OrgBook BC provides a pillar of trust around legal entities in British Columbia, we hope other jurisdictions might adopt the OrgBook model. However there are many more we think - College of Physicians and Surgeons, Engineering Associations, Law Societies, Universities and Colleges, Government Ministries/Departments, membership organizations (Hyperledger, Sovrin, Industry Associations, etc) and more I am sure. All these have the pattern of having public statements of accreditation of their members.\n\nA very long response .. hope that was helpful.","username":"jljordan_bcgov","ts":"2018-12-21T11:42:52.463Z","attachments":[{"message_link":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=SBHW9mns3QHJfmxMp","url":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=SBHW9mns3QHJfmxMp","remote":true,"fileId":null,"fileName":null}]}

{"msg":"[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=rE3kK7bKGQZDofeZS) @DuckLover Answers - yes, it's possible (and expected) to change the private key for a DID - key rotation - and you must have sign the request with the current private key for the DID.  A second DID cannot be created with the same key pair - at most, the DID can be updated because the request is signed by the private key of the DID. However, one of the tenents of these systems is that you don't let others know your private key or (if you keep it) the seed used to create the keypair. That's the only way a second person could update the DID.\n\nYes, in theory several DIDs could be controlled by one keypair, but you would have to go out of the way to do it. When you create a DID in Indy, the DID string is based on the initial public key of the pair. So to have two keys with one keypair, you would have to create each DID and then rotate the keys to match.  Not sure why you would want to do that, but sure, fill your boots.  Since the public keys would be the same, people would know they had the same private key.  So possible but dumb (same as one password) and inconvenient (different from one password).","username":"swcurran","ts":"2018-12-28T18:30:10.541Z","attachments":[{"message_link":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=rE3kK7bKGQZDofeZS","url":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=rE3kK7bKGQZDofeZS","remote":true,"fileId":null,"fileName":null}]}

{"msg":"@DavidP Underneath, we're relying on libsodium's box and box_seal to handle this. When encrypting first thing we do is use the sender's private key and the receiver's public key to encrypt the message. We're then packaging the outputed ciphertext, the sender's public key, and the nonce into a structure called ComboBox. Then we're Anoncrypting (libsodium.box) this struct which requires only the receiver's public key because box is generating an ephemeral public key and appending the sender's public key to the ciphertext as the output of libsodium.box_seal(). Then for decrypting, we first call libsodium.box_seal_open() and the function knows how to parse the ephemeral key from the ciphertext and decrypt the message with the private key provided by the receiver in the API. This then reveals the ComboBox struct which then takes the information and calls libsodium.box_open() to decrypt the plaintext message provided in the authcrypt originally. This is finally returned with the sender's public key as well.","username":"kdenhartog","ts":"2019-02-20T16:33:17.634Z"}

This guide also introduces the use of several enterprise architecture concepts into the new world of SSI application analysis, design, and implementation. To achieve this goal, the guide uses the ArchiMate visual modeling language standard and the Archi open source, enterprise modeling tool for analysis and design. The implementation is a simple Python script. Architects and developers who are new to the HyperLedger Indy SSI software platform (Indy platform) and the Sovrin SSI governance framework (Sovrin framework) will gain significant new knowledge and understanding about the design and implementation of SSI solutions using the approach documented in this guide.\n","username":"mwherman2000","ts":"2019-04-01T18:35:47.382Z","attachments":[{"message_link":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=ZDrWthKCKTEdED47S","url":"https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=ZDrWthKCKTEdED47S","remote":true,"fileId":null,"fileName":null}]}

{"msg":"Hello everyone, \n\nFor our master thesis, we are studying solutions to support account migration on the Mastodon social network (https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/issues/177). \nIn order to achieve this, we thought about distributed ledger technologies to build decentralized, human-meaningful and secured identifiers which we think could be a major update to increase the popularity of decentralized social networks.\nDuring our researches, we found the Hyperledger Indy project and we are wondering if this project could fit our needs. We would want to allow people to have a unique ID on the network which is independent of the instance they are registered on. In this case (according to our understanding), only one DID is needed per user (or more if if want to use more than one ID) and we need to link a human-meaningful name to it. This DID will allow transfers of personal data between two instances while letting the following list of other people following you unchanged. We would also want to know if we could connect to one instance using Indy keys instead of a password. \n\nI hope this description of our project is understandable. We would want to know if it is feasible and what you think.","username":"ONRising","ts":"2019-04-17T14:44:23.828Z"}

We're looking at a schema as a multi-dimensional object rather than a single data object. The major benefits of representing a schema in that way are explained in the paper but I'm sure there will be other minor undiscovered benefits that we haven't come across yet. There are also other facets of the ODCA work that are not mentioned in the paper, including industry sector tagging for data object searchability and how consent is dealt with. We'll expand on those pieces in future versions of the paper as the middleware tooling matures. Finally, don't confuse a regular \"schema\" with a \"schema base\". A \"schema base\" is only one part a regular \"schema\". With ODCA, you need linked overlays to complete the final representation of a schema. I hope that helps.","username":"pknowles","ts":"2019-04-27T15:41:45.903Z"}

{"msg":"@pknowles when I say regular schema I mean that a schema base without its overlays, would that still make sense?  that is a multidimensional schema flattened to just the shema-base.  You seem to allude to this possibility  in your paper. Since the overlays can be added by different apps/views then those would be then \"additive\" or defining views. For example the type tagging from schema.org and the pii-attributes in your example could be in the schema-base and it would make sense as a schema in itself. With the addition of overlays for example at the Agent level I could add more BIT tags to attributes not in my original list (maybe there would be exceptions here, that is I can only add (not reduce my encryption level) to the pii-attributes for example). In other words the overlays are context sensitive specializations of the schema-base with some restrictions (as in the case of pii-attributes).  Then when the app that operates at a certain level or context looks at the schema, it sees the schema-base with all the overlays applied appropriate to its context. Do I have this right?","username":"VipinB","ts":"2019-04-27T22:59:54.608Z"}

{"msg":"[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/indy?msg=cKvtiJpSfEAKNQxBb) @rfu2k Great questions. I realize this is in the Indy channel but I'll answer them for Sovrin specifically. I'll hit them 1 by 1.\n1. That's right.\n2. That's also right.\n3. There is an _idea_ of costs. They will be low :) But you're right, that functionality isn't implemented yet.\n4. You're right, the costs are pooled and used for running the network. The Sovrin Foundation Economic Advisory Council is the group responsible for deciding how that fee revenue is apportioned amongst the Foundation, stewards, etc. There are many different parties thinking hard about the long-term plan but in the very short-term, there is no policy for sharing this revenue with stewards. If you're interested in joining the conversation, the Governance Framework Working Group is always open. \n5. That's right - but you could imagine a scenario where institutions or service providers subsidize the cost on behalf of the holder/user.\n6. There's no charge to be a steward, if that's what you mean when you say network member. The Foundation has the Sovrin Alliance which does have an annual membership fee, but it also has perks that go along with it. The primary purpose for the Alliance is to throttle Foundation staff's time. Everybody wants an hour with @nage of course, and same for many others on the team, but our general policy is that we spend time with those who are spending time/money on the open source. The Alliance lets us also spend time with commercial entities who want our time to help them with their business or commercial needs - or who just want to support the Foundation's mission by supporting it. Many stewards are Alliance members simply because they want to see the Foundation succeed. \nHope that helps. You're definitely on the right track.

Is there any provision for on-chain claims to be stored on Indy as well as DIDs / schemas etc.? Of course this would be much less private as anyone with access to the ledger (presumably anyone? - is it possible to run sync’ing, non-validating nodes with Indy?) could tell that Bob’s DID (and Alice’s and anyone else) was associated with this un-encrypted attestation.","username":"adamdossa","ts":"2019-05-01T00:59:30.393Z"}

{"msg":"@adamdossa - it's an interesting use case.  I'm guessing that the question is wrong, but here are a couple of issues with how you have it framed.  First, in Indy, no credentials go on to the blockchain.  They are issued to the Holder of the credential, and used by the the Holder to prove things.  Second, you would not be able to use another person's credential without their consent, so using a an issued identity credential to prove citizenship (or whatever) cannot/should not be done unilaterally. ","username":"swcurran","ts":"2019-05-01T15:09:24.647Z"}
{"msg":"@swcurran thanks - that makes sense. The way I am thinking about it now is that the payment processor is an agent that would hold the KYC credentials (not on-chain, but locally) of any users it wants to be able to transfer funds between. It would be up to Alice & Bob to provide their credentials to the payment processor if they want to be able to use it. The payment processor then just verifies the credentials it holds for Alice & Bob (using the Indy ledger for validation) - assuming everything is kosher, it allows the payment to proceed, if not then it would need to go back to Alice & Bob (e.g. if Alice's credentials had expired).","username":"adamdossa","ts":"2019-05-01T15:31:28.497Z"}

Is the actual certificate stored with the issuer and the certificate owner?  When an versifier wants to verify my credentials I send my DID they check the ledger and get my DDO. The DDO is sent to my agent/me it is signed with my private key and sent back to the versifier. Is the issuer ever contacted through the verification process?  Or is the trust mostly in the ledger. Is it possible to verified the certificate with the actual issuer?  I hope I am framing this correctly...

There's only limited number of edge cases where this actually could be a concern. For the most part, you can trust it once it's hit the mempool.

{"msg":"First off, issuers know to whom the credential is issued. They are attesting to that fact by agreeing to sign some attributes about them. We use what’s called a link secret to bind the credentials together so the holder can prove all of them belong to the same identity. This is never revealed to anyone so even if an issuer is compromised then you don’t have to change it. The link secret is blinded before the issuer signs it. During a proof this value also stays hidden and to a verifier it looks like a different presentation every time because proofs have randomness to them. For example, if the verifier just asked to prove they are a member of the group and nothing else, then they don’t learn anything else. That’s what’s zero knowledge means. The verifier has a very low chance of correlating you. Now if you reveal your name then correlation risks rise a lot. The point is you don’t need to change information for a value that nobody knows if the issuer is compromised. Indy doesn’t typically issue credentials to a DID, it’s to a link secret. That way holders can use the credentials across DIDs.\n\nAnother piece of information that does leak during a proof presentation is who the issuers are because, the verifier needs to know which public keys to use for verification and which revocation registries to check.","username":"MALodder","ts":"2019-05-28T12:09:29.940Z"}

If I get credential A for my DID did:sovrin:abcd, can I then create zero-knowledge proofs regarding that credential and present them to the issuer, acting as verifier, without revealing what my DID is? Because my next question would then be how can I actually present a proof without leaking my DID in a DID-based communication system such as Indy? Should I use an external communication infrastructure that does not rely on DIDs? What about a Tor network then, since typical internet-based communication leaks other type of information such as IP addresses and MAC addresses? I might have come up with a way to use ZKPs without generating new DIDs, and it relies on being able to communicate with the verifier-issuer using HTTPS (only verifier authenticates itself) over Tor network, so that proof requests and proofs are part of the HTTP header or body payloads.

{"msg":"So I believe there is a disconnect between what you understand of Indy and anonymous credentials.I’ll attempt help with that. DIDs can’t be correlated directly because the idea is they are pairwise. Establishing new connections is cheap. I just create a new DID and send it to another party. New connection done secure channel setup. Now comes the issue of trust. DIDs don’t establish that, they just make sure the channel is secure. What is nice about pairwise DIDs is that Bob knows Alice as DID \"abc\" and Charlie knows Alice as DID \"def\". Unless Charlie tells Bob that Alice is also known as \"def\", Bob would not be able to correlate Alice by DID alone. This makes DIDs contextual. This mimics the real world in the sense that you are known by different things in different contexts like with family you are a sibling, son, grandson and work you are an employee, boss, owner. Anonymous credentials help establish trust in those contexts. This is similar to meeting someone new in person. That's the easy part. But trusting that person doesn't come until you get to know more about them. To get to know someone digitally requires trustable credentials. The two parties can share as much information as they want and they both can verify it using Indy which until now could not be done outside of special deployments. Anonymous credentials are not issued to DIDs. They are issued to an identity that lives behind multiple DIDs. Alice can use her credentials to make proofs to multiple DID channels. When a holder wants to begin receiving credentials, the holder creates a link secret that is a random number always kept private. The link secret is blinded before the issuer signs it, so the issuer never knows the true value. Even if the holder goes to the same issuer, this number appears unique every time due to how the blinding is done. The issuer signs the value without knowing its true value, called a blinded signature. The remaining attributes are known to the issuer and signed as well. To make a proof, the holder must know every attribute value and the signature. The dislcosure proof, allows Alice to choose to reveal attributes while the remaining are kept hidden. The verifier receives a proof that hidden attributes exist and Alice knows what the signed values are. So for your example of a fleet, an electric vehicle could establish a new DID with each charging station. The credential could prove its a member of the fleet without revealing which member. The only thing the charging station learns is DID B arrived at HH:mm:SS on YYYY-MM-DD and proved to be a valid fleet member and stayed for 45 minutes to charge. That's it unless the proof description requires the vehicle to reveal more information like a fleet number or vehicle number. ZKPs are not perfect in that they eliminate correlation entirely but they enhance privacy where before they had to reveal everything or implement complex methods to perform selective disclosure.","username":"MALodder","ts":"2019-05-29T13:56:27.588Z"}

The charging station are only able to read and validate authorization tokens, which are obtained by the user on a per-charge basis, upon verification from its fleet manager that he/she is indeed a customer.\nBut anyways, you are saying that generating new DIDs is not time-consuming (this would happen on a recent mobile device).

{"msg":"Good questions.  I believe the teams working on agents (e.g. indy-agent, indy-catalyst and I believe agent-framework) are all using non-secrets for storing relationship metadata and protocol state information in a similar way, but there has not been formal discussions on exactly what to store.  This will be necessary for portability (being able to pick up your data from one agent to another), so these discussions need to happen relatively soon.  @andrew.whitehead might want to weigh in here and add/correct anything here.

{"msg":"The how-to guides help somewhat although they are somewhat outdated. E.g. they don't show how to use pack/unpack rather than authcrypt/anoncrypt. My suggestion would be if you go that route to try and build a library independent of the app itself that handles the API calls. Then consume the library in the app. That was the thinking behind AgentFramework and libVCX because the IndySDK calls are fairly primitive compared to what makes sense in an agent. I assume you would get a few people willing to help on the library/framework if you went that route given the plethora of people who work with js.","username":"kdenhartog","ts":"2019-05-31T06:31:36.317Z"}

{"msg":"@MALodder I agree with you there's no need to, but the use case requires the user to ask for a token to its fleet manager every time he needs to charge. And in order to get the token, he needs to prove to the manager that he is a customer. Hence, everytime the user needs to create a connection witht the fleet manager and then send to proof over such connection?","username":"Diiaablo95","ts":"2019-05-31T13:27:33.313Z"}
{"msg":"To clear up a confusion with terminology, creating a connection in this space means to establish a new relationship with another party. When you say create a connection I believe you are meaning the user communicates with the fleet manager to get the token.\n\nSo with that in mind, the user does not need to create a new connection but communicates with the fleet manager when he needs a token. Indeed he'll just send a proof that he's a customer and that's it. Now, if you don't want the fleet manager to have any correlation whatsoever, you do not have to this over a DID connection and can be completely anonymous. However, there is nothing that guarantees no one has tampered with the messages. Say Alice is a customer and Bob is the fleet manager. Alice can send a valid proof to Bob but without a DID connection, Mallory can change the proof to another valid one without Alice or Bob knowing. Alice's proof could be valid but Mallory sends another proof for a revoked customer. Bob won't be able to tell the difference. With a DID, Bob only knows that DID 'abc' sent a proof and needs a token. Small price to pay for security.","username":"MALodder","ts":"2019-05-31T13:55:06.569Z"}

However the getting started guide (https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/samples/python/src/getting_started.py) show's a much less sophisticated method of creating pairwise did's.

{"msg":"@BreizhIndy Indy's performance will depend hugely on how big the pool of validators is, how much RAM and compute power they have, and how fast their network connections are. Thus, there isn't a general \"Indy performance\" study. However, I know that the team that builds Indy does evaluate Indy in a specific configuration to guarantee acceptable performance before each release. They are trying to prove sustained reads of thousands of reads per second and >10 writes per second, with a validator pool of 25-ish, and they have consistently achieved those metrics. Less validators would increase write performance significantly. (10 writes per second sounds slow to me, although it is twice as fast as the global bitcoin network. However, Indy has a number of performance optimizations that are still teed up, that should easily allow this number to be 1-3 orders of magnitude faster when we need it. It just hasn't been a focus for now, partly because of how skewed traffic is toward reading.) The bottom line is that Indy's performance is predictable, and fast enough, for the use cases we have today.

When the credential is used to present proof, the verifier and the holder/prover each do a ledger read to check an accumulator value.

{"msg":"In most cases, an edge agent will not have a persistent endpoint that the cloud agent can connect to at will; for example, a mobile phone does not have a consistent IP Address and a web server running, accepting POST requests. The edge agent must initiate the connection to the cloud agent in order for the cloud agent to deliver messages to the edge that it received on it's behalf. The edge agent alone holds the keys to decrypt the message, as you correctly pointed out. These are the kinds of discussions that are being held in the #aries channel which is the cross-ledger interoperable agents project Hyperledger Aries :slight_smile: ","username":"dbluhm","ts":"2019-07-19T14:37:08.487Z"}

{"msg":"Thank you @dbluhm. So the cloud agent will hold the messages until the edge initiates the connection. And once edge agent initiates the connection, all the queued message will be delivered to the edge agent at once right? And the connection has to be initiated by the edge agent only, since there cannot be persistent binding because of no static IP of the edge agent. Is this correct?","username":"ShrinivasDeshmukh","ts":"2019-07-19T14:43:23.782Z"}
{"msg":"We've discussed a few ways this could be done. One way is the edge agent initiates the connection and the cloud agent bundles all queued messages into a single response, as you've described. Another way that could be beneficial for very simple agents (static agents, for instance, perhaps running on an IoT device) is the cloud agent responds with a single message each time but indicates that more messages are pending so the edge agent continues to post a message that triggers the sending of another message in the pending queue until the pending count reaches 0. This is described in detail in the [transport return route Aries RFC](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0092-transport-return-route). Another option is that the edge agent opens a WebSocket or other bidirectional transport to the cloud agent and all the messages could be transferred over the socket individually.","username":"dbluhm","ts":"2019-07-19T14:58:14.340Z"}

{"msg":"@ShrinivasDeshmukh - if you want to see an example of this, there is a demo \"performance.py\" in the aries-cloudagent-python `demo` folder.  See the docs for how to run it - you have to pass into the startup a third parameter set to True.  When you do that, the demo spins up three agents - Alice, Alice's routing agent and Faber.  Faber then issues and Alice receives 300 verifiable credentials and timing information is generated.  In the code you can see how Alice and her routing agent collaborate.\n\nThe demo readme shows only how to run the demo in default (Alice - Faber directly), but you can tweak the startup to add the third parameter.  Let me know if you have trouble with that and we can help.  The easiest way to just run it is to use the \"In Your Browser\" method in the readme.

So to my understanding a schema is more for standardising attributes that should be used if an issuer wants to issue a credential. A credential definition schema on the other hand gives the credential to add more info on top of it and for a verifier to say that he only trusts Issuer A and will only verify credentials issued by Issuer A or credential definition schema A.","username":"sukalpomitra","ts":"2019-08-06T17:00:38.788Z"}

{"msg":"It's not Postgres specific - will be the same for any wallet.  We've done some assessment on our use case, but we'd be interested in what you see.\n\nEvery time you create a credential, the credential is stored in the `item` table and 2*# of claims in credential+6 encrypted `tags` are automatically created.  The six extra is an approximation right now based on our calculations - not looking at code.\n\nThe claim tags are needed if you want to use search queries to find credentials in your wallet with specific claim names and specific claim values.  If you know you don't need to search for credentials, you can set a credential tag policy in Indy that allows you to NOT create some or all of the claim tags. We'll have numbers soon, but we think we'll reduce tag storage by about 75-80%.\n\nWe found that the tags for the credentials we are using are about 0.5kb each, so depending on the credentials, it can take a lot of storage.\n\nWe also found that by default, our Aries agent is storing an item for each protocol state record.  So, for each issuing of a credential, the credential exchange record is stored completely for the full sequence of calls (offer, request, issue), which is quite a lot of data.  We are trying a few things to deal with that:\n\n- deleting the protocol records after the protocol completes, where it makes sense for our use case\n- reducing the data that we are collecting in the protocol record as the state of the protocol instance moves forward.  For example, after the Offer-Credential message is processed and the Request-Credential message is sent, the data about the Offer can be reduced/eliminated as we no longer need it.\n\nBoth of those somewhat depend on the use case (e.g. the need for auditing) so we are looking at ways to make that configurable if it makes sense.  Our use case we don't need that, so we are just using methods to minimize storage.\n\n@cam-parra - this note might be of interest to you.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2019-09-20T18:51:01.021Z"}

{"msg":"No, creating a \"Sovrin Steward\" DID (user) is not required to be able to use a Sovrin network.  Creating a Sovrin Steward user is only required for Sovrin Stewards.  This is because each Steward is required to host a validator node in one of the Sovrin Networks.  In the past, the steward role could do more than just host a node, but with recent changes, the steward role does not have any other privileges on a Sovrin network.\n\nGenerically, each node in a default indy network must be added by a different steward DID so you will need at least one per node.","username":"lynn.bendixsen","ts":"2019-10-09T16:09:11.144Z"}

The Prover also knows its own factor, b, because it was given its entry's index in the tails file, and can calculate u*b = e, where e is the accumulator. \nThe prover then uses zero knowledge proof to prove to the issuer that he knows u and b using product proofs.\n\nNow let’s say the prover has 2 credential definitions, one which is revoked and one which is not. My question is what stops the prover to use u and b from the credential definition that was not revoked while sharing a credential definition that was revoked.\n\nExample: Let’s say a prover has a driving license and a university degree from a same issuer. Then the issuer revokes the driving license but not the university degree. In this case while sharing driving license with the verifier the prover also shares u and b values of university degree and not driving license (since driving licence was revoked).","username":"vardan10","ts":"2019-11-05T09:26:34.411Z"}

{"msg":"Hi all, I have recently started looking at Indy and I was wondering if someone might be able to help me understand some points about proof negotiation. I have been looking at this RFC (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0037-present-proof), and have a few queries about the _cred_def_id_. From my current understanding, a credentialDefinition is required for every issuer who wishes to issue a credential for a particular schema. When a verifier requests proof does this mean that they have to ask for a specific definition of the credential in the proof? Is there any way to request proof that the holder owns a credential for a particular schema without specifying the actual definition of the schema?

{"msg":"Hi, how I understand this is as follows:-  a credential definition is unique per issuer and the definition id also holds the public did if the issuer. An issuer creates a credential definition from a schema. A verifier introduces a human trust element by adding a restriction in its proof request by adding a list of cred_def_id. Which generally translates that a verifier is trusting a list of issuers. A credential from the same schema but issued by a different issuer not in list in the cred def id provided by the verifier is not acceptable by the verifier.

{"msg":"1. A \"pool\" is a set of nodes that participate in consensus with each other. The word \"network\" sometimes refers to the same thing, but in our definition also includes the agents and clients that connect to the pool. \n2. I think the encoding is configurable and we suggest to use SHA256 (which I think is the default...).\n3. The seed is a 32 character string used to generate your Steward DID and keys. It is a value that you can save in case your wallet is lost, or in case you want to allow someone else in your organization to act as the Steward. Using the seed, you can create the exact same DID and keys in multiple wallets. I am not sure why the original developers chose 32 characters as the requirement, but it probably has a lot to do with security and consistency for the ledger.","username":"lynn.bendixsen","ts":"2019-12-12T21:53:51.575Z"}

A verifier can see that the same link secret is used across the claims within a proof.\n\nBasically - DIDs are used for two things.  First, a credential issuer must have a DID on the ledger so that a verifier can determine who issued the credential from which came the claims in a proof. Second, DIDs are used between entities to communicate using a secure channel.  Beyond the issuer's DID there are no other DIDs involved in a verifiable credential exchange.

{"msg":"A question for @kenebert and @brentzundel.  We've had a couple of reasonable requests about when a proof is \"verified\" with respect to the proof request used. These are not part of the current process, and I wonder if they were planned to be supported in the Rich Schema work?\n\n1) Recently add to Indy is the idea of a group of claims that have common restrictions. Will it be possible with Rich Schema to express in the Rich Schema work that the credentials in the group MUST come from the same credential?  I believe that currently, all claims are handled independently in the proof/verification process. So far example, I can say \"must use a Driver's License Schema\" and such that the claims can be from any jurisdiction that issued Driver's License schema credentials, but claims returned must be from the same credential.\n\n2) We have found that in Indy, it appears that all claims are optional. That is, I can have a proof request asking for some claims, get back a proof with some of the claims provided and the proof will be \"verified\" (which is cryptographically correct). Will there be in Rich Schema to indicate required/optional claims such that the proof would only be verified if all the required claims were provided. Note that the existing behaviour is also very useful, so we don't want to lose it.\n\nIf that is not planned, at what level would you expect such logic to be added?  If not in Indy, I'm assuming the app would have to do that business checking and presumably send a Problem Report message back to the Prover and redo the process.  It would be much better if the prover knew those requirements ahead of time and only constructed a proof meeting those guidelines.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-01-09T20:56:06.254Z"}

{"msg":"Hi, guys, I have some questions about the Hyperledger Indy focusing on the credential revocation. Thank you for your help.\n\nThe credential revocation of Indy refers to https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/hipe/en/latest/text/0109-anoncreds-protocol/README.html\nThe CKS accumulator refers to this paper https://eprint.iacr.org/2008/539.pdf\n\nQuestions\n\n1. In the Non-revocation Credential Cryptographic Setup phase, a type-III pairing is chosen. Is there any suggestion while choosing all three groups G1, G2 and GT? For example, how many bits is the order r suggested to be? By the way, is there some special purpose to use a type-III pairing? The referred CKS accumulator uses a type-I pairing which G1 = G2. The CKS accumulator could be referred here.\n\n2. The architecture includes an accumulator system that the issuer side stores the states (V and {g'_i} for all i in [1, 2L]) and the blockchain stores the indices V and accumulator acc.\n\nBy the definition of accumulator on wiki:\nA cryptographic accumulator is a one way membership function. It answers a query as to whether a potential candidate is a member of a set without revealing the individual members of the set. \n\nWe have the following questions:\n\nIt seems not a one-way function if everyone can observe V and acc together from the blockchain. The mapping of indices i and parameters g'_i could be gradually found after several accumulator updates.\n\nFollowing the above question, after the mapping relationship is totally observed, I believe the membership of the current accumulator is entirely revealed.\n\nIf V is stored on the ledger, the size of V keeps growing alone with more holders get involved in. In my opinion, the size of a cryptographic accumulator should be independent from the number of members.\n\nIn short, we estimate that the indices V may not be suitable to be published and stored on the ledger. Please feel free to indicate if we misunderstood something. \n\nThank you very much.","username":"KyleHuang","ts":"2020-01-15T06:43:22.755Z"}

(All Trustee DIDs are created by you and put into the file as part of the script)   \n3- the seed returned by init-indy-node is the seed used to generate the keys for that node.  If your node needs re-installed, add the seed as the last parameter to the same init-indy-node command that you ran the first time, and it will generate the same seeds as when you ran it the first time.\n5- Your implementation should work, but be careful to make sure you use sufficient Memory (32G/node is recommended and tests have shown issues when using 8G or less) and make sure you don't run out of disk space.  I have seen cases where out-of-disc-space problems give unrelated error messages that are hard to track down.

{"msg":"1. It depends what the DID method you are talking about.  Indy does not yet support that.  With did:peer you could send to the other side anything, but the other agent is unlikely to know what to do.\n\n2. Not really, but arguable. If the DID is on a public ledger (immutable), what does \"revoke\" mean?  You could null out the public key(s)/endpoint in the DIDDoc as an indicator to say \"abandoned!\". The previous public keys are still there.  As well, you can just stop responding to interactions with that DID.  It's still there, but you unilaterally ignore it. You could even delete your private key for it.\n\n3. If you are creating a public DID, you create it yourself, and then you send it to be published on a ledger.  That would be the \"third party\" you are talking about. If it is a private, pairwise DID (did:peer), you send it to the other party that you want to use the DID.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-02-23T20:24:14.522Z"}

{"msg":"It looks to me like your pool has been corrupted somehow.  Is it your own test pool?  If so, one way to fix it is that you can start over by deleting all of the ledger data (unless you need the data for some reason). Stop indy-node, delete the contents of the `/var/lib/indy/<network-name>/data` directory from each node and then restart indy-node on all of the nodes.

You want to reference a different instance of an Indy network other than Sovrin.

{"msg":"I think the summary of the document is that a ZKP (and likely any) proof is non-repudiable if the claims within it are sufficient to be trusted by a third party.  The verifier passes the proof to the third party, the third party verifies it and they see both enough information in the claims and they trust the issuers of those claims. So it is not that the ZKP is non-repudiable it's the content of the proof.  As you say, nothing magical about the ZKP at all other than that it makes the claims within authoritative from the issuers through to the 3rd party.  That makes sense. It has the ramification that a verifier wanting non-repudiation has to collect more information from the prover, and must preserve that information.\n\nThanks.

{"msg":"> think the summary of the document is that a ZKP (and likely any) proof is non-repudiable if the claims within it are sufficient to be trusted by a third party.\n\nI'd summarize it almost this way, but with this nuance: it's not just general strength of claims. What makes a proof non-repudiable is whether the claims *bind the proof to the prover* strongly enough that the prover can't deny having made it. With interactive ZKPs, this is never true, because the verifier of the proof could game the binding. With non-interactive ones, this problem doesn't exist.","username":"danielhardman","ts":"2020-04-24T01:31:40.910Z"}

{"msg":"@conanoc  I guess for a use case clarity we need to separate technical and legal parts of \"sign the contract\" meaning. From a technology and my point of view that could be: Alice is identified by \"passport VC\" and Insurance company could organize confirmation/signature of the contract (or just record in their DB) in a way they are happy with that. They know, that was Alice, which proved her identity. As example Alice’s “signature” could be issued VC by her. She is ok with the contract No123 from Insurance company xyz. That is technology part. \nThe legal part to \"sign the contract\" could be more complicated, mainly it depends on a particular country law. I am not sure if Indy will cover all possible use cases from a law point of view. In this particular Alice case if law is requiring \"contract signature\" between supplier and customer, first of all, VC should be a part of legal regulation. Based on that any VC issued by Alice could be treated as a legal action. Without VC legislation signature by VC will be not legal.\nAs per my opinion legal part is most challenging in “digital” KYC implementation. That is one of the reasons why EU with already legal “electronic signature” solution (eIDAS) proposing gateway approach for a quick solution between SSI and existing eIDAS. From a legal point of view If you sign VC with already legal e-signature your VC should be treated as a part of legal regulation.

{"msg":"NOT A LAWYER :-)\n\nIn most places I know of, a sufficient \"digital signature\" is a declaration of agreement by a known entity. More simply put, having a web session where the person \"logged in\" and agrees to sign (acknowledge by some act) is sufficient.\n\nSo, if the session with the user can be verified by the provision of a proof from a trusted authority, that will be good enough, and much better than the existing techniques.  Currently, what you do is login and then over share data such that the other party (insurance company) is \"pretty certain\" that you are the person you say you are.  They mitigate their risk.

My question is that, every holder/user on the network is assigned a service endpoint which the user gets connected to. The service endpoint is a different port number for each user on the network. So would this architecture be scalable as we might be needing to assign identity to thousands, millions or billions of users at some later point of time. How Sovrin would be handling the IP address ranges to be assigned to the users/holders in future?","username":"debumonty","ts":"2020-07-02T15:37:28.075Z"}

The main differences are that on MainNet only an endorser can ADD a credDef/RegDef. This means that they are also the only ones that can ADD/EDIT entries or other related actions. A Transaction Author must find an Endorser to sign these actions for them.  This was done because Endorser was the role assigned to do all of the credential issuance type txn's while the ledger remains permissioned. Allof those txn's are fee based and are charged to the Endorser monthly.\nI am almost certain that the owner context for RegDef txns is the owner of the RegDef.

Is it saved on a blockchain or just a local database?\nSecondly, I still don't get how the verifier entity verifies the correctness of the presented values? From what I understood, the personal data of the student or the holder of a transcript are not saved on the ledger, so what does the verifier compare against the ledger if the data is not there?\nI would appreciate your help, thank you in advance.","username":"MarinaELias","ts":"2020-08-24T14:25:15.201Z"}

This can either be the default local database (I believe it's rocksDB or sqlite), or use a storage plugin such as the postgresql plugin, which would store the wallet in any postgres database (which can be either local or in the cloud).  With respect to verifying the \"correctness\" of the presented values, it is more correct to say that the verifier is verifying the source of the presented values, which is the authority that issued the credential.  The issuer authority has a public verkey that is published to the ledger, along with a key associated with the credential definition.  These keys are used to \"sign\" the credential.  When generating this signature, the private keys associated with the authority issuer and credential definition are used, as well as the actual value of the credential.  This ensures that only the issuer authority can generate a valid signature, and the properties of the credential cannot be modified without invalidating the signature.  Therefore, by validating the signature, the verifier is confirming the source and veracity of the credential data.","username":"jameshiester","ts":"2020-08-24T16:11:18.110Z"}

While alternative systems are also feasible, the ledger provides an excellent way to achieve consensus around what format those keys and schemas should be published in, and a consistent and fault tolerant way of reading them.  Additionally, the blockchain creates an immutable record, so it is easy to audit the entire trail of a schema or key back to who created it, and even who onboarded that identity and all the ancestor identities going back to the original genesis transaction.  In short, it's a good way of allowing peer-to-peer credential sharing, while still creating an anchor of trust.","username":"jameshiester","ts":"2020-08-24T17:01:35.123Z"}

{"msg":"The answer lies in a secret passwed between the student and original issuer.  The holder (student) provides the issuer a blinded link secret that is inserted into the credential before it is issued. To prove the credential, the holder must prove (in zero knowledge) that they possess the link secret to unblind the the blinded link secret. That proves that the entity that constructed the proof was the one to which the credential was issued. When there are multiple credentials sourced into a single proof, all must use the same link secret.  That being said, no digital system is 100% effective in preventing identity theft.  The secret is still stored in the users wallet, so if an attacker is able to get access to the wallet and decrypt it, they would be able to steal the student's identity.  This is why wallets need to be protected with strong authentication, which very likely includes biometrics","username":"jameshiester","ts":"2020-08-25T12:19:06.668Z"}

{"msg":"There is nothing inherent in SSI for the use case you are defining. The user has been issued some credentials. A verifier asks the user for proof of those credentials via a proof request. The user (holder/prover) decides to construct provide and send the proof. At that point, the verifier has received the data and can do with it what they want -- there is nothing in the technology to prevent that, and there is nothing the holder/prover can do to \"revoke\" having given over the information.\n\nThink of the same scenario with paper credentials -- showing your driver's licence.  You can't go back later and say \"Forget that I showed you my licence\".\n\nWhere this goes is the governance framework under which the participants are operating (if any). Under what conditions (e.g. GDPR, etc.) was the proof requested, and the proof sent.\n\nFinally -- to be clear, an issuer of a credential can often revoke the credential to prevent the holder/prover from being able to continue to prove the credential they were issued.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-10-12T08:24:16.855Z"}

{"msg":"Some central concepts about this.  \n\nAuthorizations on the ledger are configurable, so in theory, the answer to your questions may be affected by the configuration of the specific ledger.\n\nThat said, in general the terms with the permissions are \"Trustee\", \"Steward\" and \"Endorser\" (formerly \"Trust Anchor\"). In general, Trustees will create all Stewards and Endorsers.  Stewards will ONLY be able to do operations that affect their node of the network, and would NOT create Endorsers. Further, Endorsers can create DIDs for Authors (no ability to create other DIDs), but that's it.\n\nTo your questions:\n\n0. Change \"Steward\" to \"Trustee\" across the intro and the questions.\n0. \"a\" is an Endorser and cannot create \"b\" another Endorser (caveat -- MAYBE the rules can be set up for that, but unlikely).\n1. A Trustee may have authority to remove the \"Endorser\" privilege of \"a\" to just an Author.  A Trustee cannot change the verkey of the Endorser, and cannot delete the DID altogether.\n2. Since \"b\" can only be created by the Trustee (not \"a\" unless \"a\" is a Trustee), the Trustee can operate as per the paragraph above about \"a\".\n3. There is no \"delegation\" flow involving the two DIDs -- they are independent of one another.\n\nHope that helps.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2020-11-17T00:50:20.848Z"}

{"msg":"For 1, the answer is yes and no :-).\n\nWithin LibIndy, there are three elements associated with the DID -- the verkey (public key), the private key and the DID identifier.  The latter is derived from the first verkey for a DID, so if you change the verkey and private key (e.g. rotate the keys), the DID identifier remains the same.  A DIDDoc can be constructed using three elements, but there is literal document stored.  Once you publish the NYM to an Indy Ledger, a resolver (such as the universal resolver) will retrieve those elements and return a formatted DIDDoc.  If you also add an ATTRIB to the ledger with an \"endpoint\" as the data value, the Universal Resolver will include that as a fourth element of the DIDDoc. Likewise, an endpoint can be added to a Peer DID.\n\n2. There is a private key. Libindy does not give you a way to get that, as it would be insecure.

{"msg":"So -- some thoughts.  Indy does not support the DID spec, focuses mainly on verifiable credential exchange using AnonCreds, where only the Issuer of VCs needs to have a DID on the ledger.\n\nTo create a DID on a public ledger, you can use the Indy CLI to generate a DID and then go to https://selfserve.sovrin.org/ to publish it.  The same process occurs on Sovrin MainNet, but requires more legal overhead -- the governance.\n\nTo add more to the DID (such as an Endpoint), you can use the CLI.  However, most people are using Indy because they want an agent to issue, hold, prove or verify VCs.  For that, you would probably want to get into Aries.\n\nIn other words -- just creating a DID on a public ledger is not really \"a thing\" in Indy -- it's usually associated with VCs, and for VCs, there is a lot more moving parts.\n\nHope that helps get you to the next step...","username":"swcurran","ts":"2021-02-05T00:51:33.551Z"}

{"msg":"Hi all, I had a question about the quintessential zero-knowledge proof example of Alice proving that she is over 18 without revealing her DOB - given that current Indy predicates only work on int32s, what is the best way to represent dates in a credential such that they work for predicate proofs?\nI had one idea: at first I was trying to go with an approach of number of days since a certain epoch and being able to use common datetime functions to do the calculations, but it seemed rather complicated and there were a lot of subtle issues around timezones, leap seconds, which epoch to choose, etc. The approach I would like to propose is to apply simple modular arithmetic to map a date to an int of the form YYYYMMDD. This would allow easy conversion to int and back to date without any confusion that would result from using time libraries. The only gotchas I can see are that you couldn't represent dates before AD (which seems ok, or they could be negative which also seems ok), and that you'd need to have some error handling if somehow a credential was ever submitted with an invalid mapping eg 20201332 (13th month, 32nd day, etc) - although some error handling on credential issuing should address that. To construct the proof the verifier would just convert today's date minus 18 years to int form, and then check that the int-date DOB on the credential is < that.\nWhat do people think? Ideally I'd like to use a standard date convention so if there's not already one, I could add a proposal to https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/concepts/0074-didcomm-best-practices/README.md#date-time-conventions (or create a new RFC)","username":"jacobsaur","ts":"2021-06-24T00:08:12.352Z"}

{"msg":"Hello Everyone, \n\nI am a beginner in Hyperledger Indy and trying to understand the basics. \n\nThere is one question that I am not able to relate or understand. \n\nWhat is the purpose of adding a node to an indy pool? Does the node gets added as validator node and become a part of consensus? If so what is the reward of becoming a validator node? \n\nCould anyone please guide me here?","username":"MikeSmith","ts":"2021-07-22T17:21:25.055Z"}

{"msg":"Adding nodes to an Indy pool helps with consensus as every node currently added becomes a participator in consensus. Because of the BFT algorithm that Indy uses for consensus, the more nodes that are part of the pool, the more robust, or stable the network is (or more tolerant of nodes going down or unavailable).  \nThe best benefit of running a node on a public Indy network is the good feeling you get about donating to a great cause! Think of the prestige and the marketing opportunities! Participating also makes the network diverse, decentralized and viable, so if the product you are working on needs a network, it pays to support at least your favorite one, and maybe more than one, as we head into an era of multi-network compatibility and usage. Node Operators (Stewards) do not have any special write privileges on the major public networks at this time, they simply manage their node. Some networks might return some of the eventual profits of the network to Node Operators, but even then it is unlikely that it will do much more than cover costs IMO.","username":"lynn.bendixsen","ts":"2021-07-22T17:39:04.122Z"}

{"msg":"Hello,  In the Indy CLI the abbreviated \"pool\" is actually a \"pool handle\" that points to a network or pool of nodes.  So IF both pool1 and pool2 from your example used the same genesis file during setup, then they both refer to the same network and schemas created while you were connected to pool1 CAN be used to create credential-definitions on pool2, because in this case they are referencing the same network.\nFrom the Indy Node perspective, the network contains a \"Pool Ledger' which is a record of all of the nodes added to that network.

{"msg":"Hi Timo,  Short Answer - You must own the DID you are adding or editing the attrib for, and add the ledger fees associated with the fee named \"attrib_add\" for that specific requirement. \nMore details:  The error is essentially listing all of the possible ways to authorize the requested transaction and is based on the Auth_Rules for the ledger you are using. For example, the Sovrin BuilderNet currently has Auth_Rules that would produce that kind of output. You can see all of the auth_rules using: `indy-cli> ledger get-auth-rule` \nThe part of the message you asked about refers to any owner of the DID that wants to change or add an attrib has to pay the ledger fee associated with the request  (the fee named attrib_add).  I looked on the Buildernet to see what the current fee is and it appears that the fee table for the \"sov\" payment method has been removed, so that effectively invalidates that method of satisfying the auth_rule.\nThe only method currently valid on the builldernet for an \"Author\" (no role) to get their attrib added or changed is to have an endorser sign that transaction.  The same is not true for the Sovrin StagingNet or the Sovrin MainNet, so as you progress towards \"production\" know that the rules will change (for Sovrin's networks). On the Sovrin Staging and Main networks (And on all Indicio networks), the owner of a DID can change their attribs as much as they would like to.  @WadeBarnes might want to look into fixing that inconsistency.   Even more data  for those that  are still with me :) (Sorry for the huge post)This has been an issue historically. The network operators want to charge for attrib writes to the ledger, but the original implementation had a bug in the auth_rule restricting an Author from being able to change their attrib regardless of what signature was on the txn.  There was a \"quick fix\" applied to remove the bug but that fix made it \"free\" for authors to add/edit their attribs (can't track them down to ask for payment). Then the overall issue was never re-addressed or fixed for the desired ability to charge for it. BuilderNet seems to have addressed the bug and the ability to charge for the txn. It looks like the correct fix was applied there, but then never propagated to the other Sovrin ledgers.","username":"lynn.bendixsen","ts":"2021-10-14T20:15:48.721Z"}

You could test the behavior on Indicio's Testnet, if you like, as it is currently set up with the same over-permissive Auth_Rule for attribs.  \nThe way it currently works makes it really hard for Sovrin to collect the listed attrib fees for their networks, though, so if I had to guess, I would say not to count on it being that way for the long term.  It's really up to Sovrin on how they manage that though.\nWhile I am answering your specific question, the other posters in this thread  are pointing at what is probably the real answer to your issue.

{"msg":"BC Gov has posted a funded \"Code With Us\" Challenge for individuals/teams interested in updating Hyperledger Indy to support the new `did:indy` DID Method, specified [here](https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/). The opportunity and response guidelines are [posted here](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/marketplace/opportunities/code-with-us/e3dd1605-cc1d-4c30-a9ee-245940bccd0d). The total funding for the challenge is $70,000CDN and is divided into 4 phases. The first 3 phases require the use of Python working on the [Indy Node](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node) and [Indy Plenum](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum) repos, while the 4th phase requires Rust development in the [Indy VDR](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-vdr) repo. Those responding may choose to apply for only the Python work, only the Rust work or both.\n\nQuestions can be asked here or on the website hosting the opportunity.\n\nApplications for the challenge will be accepted up to January 10, 2022. and the work is expected to begin shortly after that date, with completion expected by March 31, 2022.","username":"swcurran","ts":"2021-12-22T19:13:16.235Z"}

{"msg":"Indy's performance will depend hugely on how big the pool of validators is, how much RAM and        compute power they have, and how fast their network connections are. Thus, there isn't a general    \"Indy performance\" study. The team that builds Indy evaluates it in a specific configuration to     guarantee acceptable performance before each release. They are trying to prove sustained reads of   thousands of reads per second and >10 writes per second, with a validator pool of 25-ish, and they  have consistently achieved those metrics. Less validators would increase write performance          significantly. (10 writes per second sounds slow to me, although it is twice as fast as the global  bitcoin network. However, Indy has a number of performance optimizations that are still teed up,    that should easily allow this number to be 1-3 orders of magnitude faster when we need it. It just  hasn't been a focus for now, partly because of how skewed traffic is toward reading.) The bottom    line is that Indy's performance is predictable, and fast enough, for the use cases we have today.   And it can be increased substantially when we need to.\nExchanging credentials does not involve the ledger very much, though. Issuance doesn't require any  write with each credential--only a write of the schema, cred def, and revocation registry that they all use. So you could issue 1000 or 10M credentials, and you still only have 3 ledger writes and no ledger reads (except maybe to populate a cache). When the credential is used to present proof, the  verifier and the holder/prover each do a ledger read to check an accumulator value. These reads are likely to be cached for the holder, if they are proving regularly; in real usage, only the          verifier's reads will probably have a linear correlation to ledger traffic.\n\nBecause of the protections on correlation, performance metrics don't need to be a primary focus     (but any and all help here is very much appreciated). Time correlation means that throughput spikes ought to be spread out over time, so we don't have to worry about \"visa network\" type numbers.\nWe have been using 10 writes per second and 100 reads per second as our performance minimum (if we  fall below that we are worried). Benchmarks can go much much faster of course, the Sovrin           Foundation uses those numbers as a guideline for our production configuration on a global pool of   24 nodes.\n\nAlso, regarding performance - 10 write transactions per second can look small compared to 1000s,    but there is huge difference in benchmarking conditions:\n- other ledgers usually use just 4 nodes, often inside one LAN, while 10 TPS in plenum was measured with 25 nodes scattered across the world, which increases number of messages per batch 40-fold with PBFT/Aardvark and 240-fold with RBFT, and increases latencies\n- other ledgers often generate batches every 5-10 seconds, but plenum defaults to 1 batch per       second, so this is 5-10 more batches per unit of time than with other projects, but significantly   decreases latency\n- other ledgers use very simple test transactions, like incrementing some counter, while in plenum  we test with writing cred defs, revocations etc with fees on top of that - many of these things use pretty heavyweight crypto\nIf we conduct a test in a single AWS VPC with 4 nodes, batch per 5 seconds and some dummy           transactions I believe we can easily achieve something in a 500 write transactions per second range with current code.\nread performance in Indy Ledger is pretty good, this is more than 5000 per sec on 25 nodes pool,    and this is easily scalable with Observer Nodes (which are almost done BTW).","username":"esplinr","ts":"2022-01-19T16:38:31.324Z"}

I think this might be better – the commitment to attend is less heavy, and perhaps calendars will be a little more flexible.

E.g. if there is an irrreprable damage on a node and all the data is gone. So a new genesis node has to come online to reach the minimum number for operation. Then I would replace the failed node with init_indy_keys script and set a new name and seed on the new server. Then just generate the new genesis files with generate_indy_pool_transactions, right? Finally distribute the genesis files in the network: \n\n1. will the new node run directly with the existing network? Can it download all the transactions from the network? \n\n2. or do I have to create the new node 1:1 with the same name, seed, IP and import a backup of all the transactions to get it running again?","username":"kwollo","ts":"2022-02-03T20:32:50.564Z"}

Security precautions are used, like clearing memory after the operation and before data is provided back to the caller.\n\nThe advantage that Askar brings is that it has more flexibility in the types keys handled, and the operations supported (enabling different crypto schemes, like  BBS+ Signatures), uses some newer database handling for more efficient operations, and is separated from other Indy operations.
