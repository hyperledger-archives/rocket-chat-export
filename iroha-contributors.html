Still, you can check out the current situation here: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-android
Maybe you'll have any interesting ideas or feedback? 

Anyway, I'd love to welcome you into the community of Iroha ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Hello everyone! Iroha Java library is now on https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-java

It is now a multi-modular Gradle project and has 2 modules:
1) Client - client SDK for Iroha;
2) Testcontainers - library for integration tests for Iroha.
No breaking changes were made - you only need to change the imports. 
You can import it using Jitpack: https://jitpack.io/#hyperledger/iroha-java

Hi community, I have a question: How will I be able to run the iroha ios example off xcode from an AWS EC2 instance? Because it seems like to run the example, ill need to actually open xcode to build and run the example, not sure how ill be able to do that off an ec2 server. I apologize if this seems to be a silly question, as i am pretty novice with Iroha. Thank you üôÇ

For gRPC on iroha javascript setup, step 3 says go here (https://gitlab.com/snippets/1713665) and run grpc-web-proxy for iroha. When you go to this link (under 'Using' section) when it sayss replace the example IP address (192.0.2.1) with the IP address of the backend server, is it referencing the IP of the EC2 its currently running on or the EC2 of the react page that will be connected to iroha javascript?

Hi There. I am from the Plenteum Development Team. We are currently doing Proof of Concepts & Testnets using Iroha. :) I contacted @SaraG (I think) on Reddit and have made quite a bit of progress especially w.r.t a CLi based in python. Right now its mostly stripped out for our applicatios but will be adding in all of the features from the current CLi to give a seamless experience
</p>
<p><strong>blockchain-Bobby</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 09:52:44 GMT):<br/>
https://plenteum.com/ is our website please see our lightpaper2 which has been updated to reflect our current plans. Our goal(and achieved somewhat) is to integrate a Public Blockchain(POW - Cryptonight based) for the Public transfer and storage of financial transactions(e.g. exchange of funds) whilst using Iroha to faciliate all of the required Business and App logic. Hope to be a proud partner eventually and will be giving the proper credit once released to Iroha and their dev team as you guys really have a GEM

challenge accepted lol got loads of freedom currently with how I am able to do things and my day job is working for an energy/petroleum supplier. I have a demo lined up for a supply chain solution I am doing a Proof of concept over the weekend on. But we have got a few things that we(I am) are currently running Iroha on. We @ plenteum are 2 guys that are doing mostly part time development but since the core/main version of our blockchain is an open permissionless blockchain(Monero/Turtlecoin Fork) with a few little tricks. We discussed about adding modifications to our chain in order to hash and store a transactions data/metadata. This allows several copies being able to verified across the Public open blockchain where users can only view TX details with their view key and the client / blockchain explorers depending on the use case. I wrote both a Flask & Python CLi project for client side interaction and tried a different approach where a user can also store a normal password to log into the App/website(that the client built (on top of our network) 
</p>
<p><strong>blockchain-Bobby</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 17:01:18 GMT):<br/>
so upon user registration. the userpassword gets hashed and written to the usings account using SetAccountDetail
</p>
<p><strong>blockchain-Bobby</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 17:04:40 GMT):<br/>
I have also created a new style wallet file which is similar to a json style document and the file is encrypted so a user needs to provide their wallet password in order to "unlock" it and retrieve their public and private keys. whilst the current way that the keys are stored is fine for testing and development its not secure for production use and i just used same methods that we normally create keypairs
</p>
<p><strong>blockchain-Bobby</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 17:22:45 GMT):<br/>
@SaraG the only other coins ive come across now that inspired me ofcourse is Ethereum with how they are able to interact with Fabric and with iroha I could do alot more alot quicker and found the flaws to my logic very quickly. so whilst we have not mentioned anything publicly about using Iroha until we ready for public release dont want to overpromise. I did an Prepaid Airtime system which we going to allow users to purchase vouchers using the Plenteum coins they have mined or bought. Currently there are not any real worl applications out there and this is currently going to be for South Africa only(we are situated here) its a little orchestration of when which functions get called in my apps that seems to be quite fun. I have got another idea hat i am starting on now for an eCommerce intergration solution. but I will keep you guys up to date with our progress.
</p>
<p><strong>blockchain-Bobby</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 17:25:12 GMT):<br/>
with python being my main language & almost everything ive worked with or want to work with has a python wrapper/module allowing for some very interesting things.
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 17:28:55 GMT):<br/>
That's cool! Are you going to contribute the Python CLI to the community or is it only an inner solution? Maybe we could work on it together since Iroha needs that..

started a "genesis block" generator too. Simply user prompt system to add the required things for a genesis block as the way its setup you can easily do things for adding a new node information and other stuff that might be required like role creation etc. @SaraG  Let me know on how i can go about things. Would love to be officially associated with the project

Elo guys. Long time been observing. I saw an official JIRA ticket for the CLi again and potentially in python? I have not stopped my Iroha projects. got actually a few things to work with Iroha from an external point of view. I see the community is quite small still but gaining the right momentum. I will post my repo once done with where i am currently at.  This still the right place to chat as i see mos stuff is in the main iroha channel

@lebdron  @igor-egorov Good Morning, Want to keep this a seperate from the main thread for now as It might get a bit confusing for some of the other users at this stage as its still myself consulting you. as an update. The CLi has got all of the menu text(ficed some of the casing and making it a bit cleaner, but I need to map the menus according to the functions. I did not define any new classes but each file has got the functions seperated accordingly(i hope) and theres the formating for the results, just a json / dictionary pretty printed so looking at some ascii/terminal tables stuff for the  formatting. also need to add in the option to specify the node that the command/query needs to be sent to after creation of the transaction as at this stage it requires it to be passed in the start up command(--node-ip 196.0.2.2:5001 example, so if a user needs to change they have to end the script and specify a new paramet

is this thread still open? want to chat with devs still working on projects using v1.x releases and building on that mainly using python & js
</p>

Hi. Probably I could help you with the python part. What kind of assistance you are looking for?
</p>
<p><strong>bobby_2hoursleep</strong> (Tue, 25 Aug 2020 14:14:42 GMT):<br/>
no help required at this moment -more just to see the general direction / consensus in the  dev community. even with v2's release around the corner. there are a few "tools" that are v1.x compatible that *might* be of use to the community. these tools  or helpers  might not be inline with the direction core development is going towards but could help someone else out there.

@igor-egorov is there an alternative block explorer solution available to the official hyperledger explorer that has been integrated?

Hi Iroha contributors - nick here from caliper-contributors. You may/may not be aware that the main remit of Caliper is to permit people to performance test different Hyperledger technologies. We're reaching the point where we need to reach out and ask for assistance in keeping "connectors" up to date and working with the main project as it moves forwards. Unfortunately Iroha is one of the connectors we are in the position to have to remove if we cannot raise interest in helping us maintain it, simply due to a lack of in-house experience our side. Is anyone here willing to help us get the Iroha connector into a working state and be a point of contact moving forwards? Fell free to reply here, in the caliper-contributors channel, or even via a PM.
</p>
