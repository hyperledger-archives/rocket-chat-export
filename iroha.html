Anyone here interested in making a chat application? ^^
</p>
<p><strong>anilmuppalla</strong> (Wed, 08 Feb 2017 18:18:36 GMT):<br/>
I am interested, but I am not sure I have time out of my day job. But, in any case what do you have in mind?
</p>
<p><strong>takemiyamakoto</strong> (Wed, 08 Feb 2017 18:26:27 GMT):<br/>
To be honest, I am not so happy with the security or usability of any chat app like slack/rocket chat/telegram. It would be nice to create some software that increases productivity and is nice to use
</p>
<p><strong>anilmuppalla</strong> (Wed, 08 Feb 2017 18:29:01 GMT):<br/>
increase productivity how? slack has extensive integrations to other platforms to increase productivity in a way.

I have a newbie question. How is Iroha different from Fabric? Is it just to enable C++ contributions?
</p>
<p><strong>takemiyamakoto</strong> (Thu, 16 Feb 2017 14:40:42 GMT):<br/>
Iroha is focused mainly on low-latency, high performance applications, such as mobile apps.
</p>
<p><strong>takemiyamakoto</strong> (Thu, 16 Feb 2017 14:41:17 GMT):<br/>
We have a different consensus algorithm and we use a different model for transactions than Fabric.
</p>
<p><strong>takemiyamakoto</strong> (Thu, 16 Feb 2017 14:41:51 GMT):<br/>
We also have core transaction types that allow you to do simple tasks, such as managing currencies, without having to write chaincode.

Hi.
I am interested in iroha.
I would like to develop smartcontract and want to know how to start peer and execute Smartcontract.
I read "github: iroha / docs", but did not know how to develop it.
Is there some sample code or document?

@norinos 
Sorry for late reply. For now, smartcontract doesn't work on the master and develop branch. Smartcontract has been developing in feature/api branch. This branch's "github: iroha / docs" assets is under constrution. I will create smartcontract docs after finishing that work.

<p><strong>takemiyamakoto</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 10:21:00 GMT):<br/>
For simple points or currencies, you do not need to write smart contracts in Iroha. We have "core transaction types," which cover base use cases and are written in high-performance C++.
</p>
<p><strong>takemiyamakoto</strong> (Mon, 20 Feb 2017 10:37:01 GMT):<br/>
We have objects and commands, which make up the core transaction types: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/issues/99

Most of those core types work now. Maybe all of them, but @MizukiSonoko would have to confirm. He is working on the API now and also documentation.

C++ or Java chaincode will be invoke by Iroha (but sorry, currently it can't).  A special method (e.g. "beginSmartContract()") in external chaincode will be invoked by Iroha. In the case of C++, the chaincode needs to be archived file(\*.a). In the case of Java, \*.class file.

<p><strong>motxx</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 15:11:28 GMT):<br/>
This test code is more accurate than at least SampleCurrency.
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/feature/api/smart_contract/Test/Test.java

- Smartcontract implementation at `feature/api`, currently not at `master`.
- It can calls untrusted Java or C++ program methods.
    - Currently, not decided about:
        - uniform entry method: e.g. beginSmartContract()
        - arbitary entry methods and config about what should be called at first.

Test.java methods `test1`, `test2`, ... can be invoked by Iroha.

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 15:14:57 GMT):<br/>
so the ledger is key/value pairs?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 15:18:15 GMT):<br/>
am I reading this correctly, that DomainRepository/Repository is the ledger state?
</p>
<p><strong>motxx</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 15:20:56 GMT):<br/>
Currently, we are using LevelDB, which is key/value store. For the future, we'll replace with our original database, iroha-ametsuchi. @takemiyamakoto knows about ametsuchi more.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 15:24:41 GMT):<br/>
in sawtooth, we are currently using key/value store (lmdb) but our state is radix/merkle tree (in 0.8 anyway; in 0.7, it was a key/value)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 15:26:50 GMT):<br/>
I think there was some discussion about protobuf vs. flatbuffer after the last meetup
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 15:27:55 GMT):<br/>
for untrusted code, how do you plan to execute it in a safe manner to guard against malicious code?
</p>
<p><strong>motxx</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 15:36:01 GMT):<br/>
For future work, we are planning to use flatbuffers. But for now, we are using protobuf because we are thinking that using gRPC and flatbuffers is costly implementation.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 15:45:31 GMT):<br/>
sawtooth considered gRPC for 0.8 (even started with it), but the python bindings were too bad (both from an API and a performance perspective)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 15:47:03 GMT):<br/>
any thoughts on the untrusted/malicious code question?

</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 16:00:31 GMT):<br/>
it seems like a very hard problem without taking a VM-based approach similar to EVM
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 16:06:23 GMT):<br/>
so, if we were to do something like this between Iroha and Sawtooth Lake - https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/issues/159 - what would we be trying to achieve?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 21 Feb 2017 16:07:52 GMT):<br/>
in other words, what would the relationship be between the two ledgers?

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 22 Feb 2017 15:17:20 GMT):<br/>
when we did a test integration with Ethereum, for example, the Sawtooth Lake transaction family queried the state from the ethereum chain; basically showing that one chain could use the other as a database

Hi.
I am trying to make Iroha work.
I want to create asset.
I have  questions.
The server accepts messages with the following specifications, is not it?
in https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/master/core/infra/server/http_server_with_cappuccino.cpp
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cappuccino::route<Cappuccino::Method::POST>( "/asset/operation",[](std::shared_ptr<Request> request) -> Response{
            auto res = Response(request);
            auto data = request->json();
            if(!data.empty()){
                try{
                    const auto assetUuid = data["asset-uuid"].get<std::string>();
                    const auto timestamp = data["timestamp"].get<int>();
                    const auto signature = data["signature"].get<std::string>();
                    const auto command   = data["params"]["command"].get<std::string>();
                    const auto value     = data["params"]["value"].get<std::string>();
                    const auto sender    = data["params"]["sender"].get<std::string>();
                    const auto receiver  = data["params"]["receiver"].get<std::string>();
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What kind of parameters should be specified specifically for creating assets?

I should apologize for you.

<p><strong>takemiyamakoto</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 09:31:01 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>MizukiSonoko</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 11:15:56 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I think C++ is a little difficult..., So Iroha should support other language's front API

@takemiyamakoto  @MizukiSonoko @yasu 
We are trying "core types" of iroha with JavaScript described in the following URL.
https://github.com/soramitsu/iroha-demo-javascript
But it doesn't work well.

In the new API, We think that it is necessary to use Python instead of JavaScript.
Because Python was used as "SDK sample" in the following issue.

Just to be clear: the iOS and Android projects are just SDKs, so they do not run an Iroha server on mobile devices. The SDKs are made to help with the creation of secure mobile apps, providing utilities such as public-private key creation and digital signatures on the devices.

<p><strong>tiennv</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 07:53:44 GMT):<br/>
@pancake you mean Iroha doesn't have any block so it doesn't support smart contract right now.
</p>
<p><strong>pancake</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 07:55:20 GMT):<br/>
@tiennv Sorry, I am just confused why there are no block in Iroha.
</p>
<p><strong>pancake</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 07:55:59 GMT):<br/>
@tiennv "Although turing complete smart contracts are available via chaincode in Java (running a sandboxed JVM), users do not need to write chaincode in order to define digital assets in Iroha." Seem Irhoa support smart contracts.

@pancake Is there any way to write a smart contract in Iroha like in Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric.
</p>
<p><strong>pancake</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 08:09:59 GMT):<br/>
@tiennv Sorry, i am not familiar with Iroha, you can ask @takemiyamakoto  for help.

@takemiyamakoto Hi,

<p><strong>tiennv</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 08:13:04 GMT):<br/>
Could you please advise me on the problem? 
</p>
<p><strong>Donald Liu</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 08:18:26 GMT):<br/>
BTW: "write a smart contract in Iroha like in Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric" in what sense?
Also: may want to visit https://gitter.im/hyperledger-iroha/Lobby
</p>
<p><strong>Donald Liu</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 08:36:43 GMT):<br/>
@tiennv Please take a look at here as well https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/wiki/Chaincode

For "like in Ethereum", I guess with HL, project burrow is the one to be reused, and there is effort between burrow and sawtooth ...
</p>
<p><strong>tiennv</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 09:27:03 GMT):<br/>
@Donald Liu : For example, in Ethereum, you can a code snippet with Solidity language and then you deploy it to Ethereum VM.
</p>
<p><strong>tiennv</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 09:27:52 GMT):<br/>
in Hyperledger Fabric, you write a code snippet in Golang and deploy it to a docker container.
</p>
<p><strong>Donald Liu</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 09:30:11 GMT):<br/>
I believe it is under proposal within Iroha:
(from the above link...)
===
To enable chaincode, we are considering 2 options:

Use LXC to sandbox chaincode execution. We can set permissions on the container to safely execute. The advantages of this is that users can write chaincode in any language they want and the chaincode environment is portable. Disadvantages are performance issues associated with managing the containers, the need to provide SDKs in multiple languages to enable chaincode output, and the need for users to store chaincode output in a specific place.

Write our own language that is then converted to C++ and compiled. Advantages are speed of execution and ability to control the output. We can provide a convenient sdk in our sub language to make it easy to develop.
===
</p>
<p><strong>Donald Liu</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 09:31:12 GMT):<br/>
btw: I saw someone asked the same question in https://gitter.im/hyperledger-iroha/Lobby as well :>

Hi, Iroha team. I created a shared calendar for all Hyperledger community meetings. You can find it here: http://bit.ly/HyperledgerCal. Use the &ctz=_TZ_ option to specify your time zone. See the TZ column for list of options: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List. I would really love to add any Iroha meetings to this calendar.  Let me know if there are public meetings that you would like to add.

Hi guys, Is there anyone in the community who'd be willing to have a chat about the Iroha architecture? It seems pretty quiet here still. I'm mainly interested in the differences between it and the other Hyperledger frameworks. ie. What does it bring to the table? Why might I want to use Iroha over Fabric or Sawtooth? Where does its focus lie? (performance/security/confidentiality etc.. or a combination of the above). Thanks in advance :)

Hi Hyperledger Iroha team.

I am looking for help with one outstanding section in the first Hyperledger Architecture WG Positioning Paper, which is on Consensus.

We need a description of how Iroha handles Consensus. Anyone here able to provide this, either verbally or in writing? It only needs to be 3-4 paragraphs

Hi, can some help me with the question about iroha project performance, I need hight speed blockchain with 10k+ transactions per second, does it possible with iroha?
</p>
<p><strong>pilouanic</strong> (Wed, 12 Jul 2017 13:54:37 GMT):<br/>
I read here https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2017/03/23/blocks-vs-transactions-language-is-important-to-the-blockchain that `Hyperledger is designed to support 280 blocks per second. If it were handling Bitcoin type transactions, it could record about 560,000 transactions per second` does this is true? 
</p>
<p><strong>takemiyamakoto</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 02:55:42 GMT):<br/>
I think the blog post is somewhat confusing. Hyperledger is not software and each platform under Hyperledger has different performance characteristics
</p>
<p><strong>pilouanic</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 11:52:15 GMT):<br/>
Yes, there a lot of objectivities belong to the performance, I talked about the iroha platform, in scope of Hyperledger
</p>
<p><strong>takemiyamakoto</strong> (Thu, 13 Jul 2017 12:53:22 GMT):<br/>
Performance depends a lot on hardware and network infrastructure

Hello, I am wondering if there is a way to extract/access the data from the blockchain, for the machine learning purpose?

What do you want specifically? Get all the blocks?
</p>
<p><strong>meiguosg</strong> (Wed, 26 Jul 2017 14:19:57 GMT):<br/>
yes, for example, Hyperledger Sawtooth has a REST API which allows you to fetch any state or blockchain data with HTTP/JSON. I wonder if it also support this in Iroha?

Hi All.. I am new to Iroha, with some understanding on Hyperledger Fabric and R3 Corda. Can anyone help me with finding a documentation or tutorial site on Iroha? I am particularly interested on the mobile language implementation part, since Fabric and Corda apps cannot be run on mobile.

Hi, I tried to build iroha-main today with `build_in_docker.sh`, but it was failed because the currently hyperleder/iroha-dev container lacks some package.
For example, cppredis and libpqxx.
Can I add below commands to Dockerfile?
Or, does Iroha required specific version?
```
# install cppredis
RUN cd /tmp; \
    git clone https://github.com/Cylix/cpp_redis.git; \
    cd cpp_redis; \
    git submodule init && git submodule update; \
    mkdir build && cd build; \
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release; \
    make; \
    make install; \
    rm -rf /tmp/cpp_redis


# install libpqxx 5.0
RUN cd /tmp; \
    wget http://pqxx.org/~jtv/tmp/pqxx/snapshot/libpqxx-5.0.tar.gz; \
    tar xfo libpqxx-5.0.tar.gz; \
    cd libpqxx-5.0; \
    ./configure && make -j$(nproc) && make install && ldconfig; \
    rm -rf /tmp/libpqxx-5.0
```

I tried to build following above instructions.
But `cmake` outputs following errors.

Someone knows how can I deal this?

<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Wed, 16 Aug 2017 08:44:14 GMT):<br/>
David, currently, to build Iroha you need to follow the guide on read page, also read information on how to start it (https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/wiki/How-to-start-Iroha) 
and how to use cli client for it (https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/wiki/How-to-use-Iroha-client). 

Soon we will post an updated docs on how to launch Iroha on multiple instances without much hassle (code is on review https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/513)

So, today we had a documentation kickoff meeting with @dhuseby @tkuhrt, Robert and others in Hyperledger.
I am putting list of action points just to make sure we did not forget anything:
- send documentation relates to queries (was that Navroop who asked me ?)
- send some complete diagram containing shared services between all the layers, modules in each layer, interconnection
- send short comparison of Iroha features (compared to other Hyperledger projects) and its distinctive features

@sushantdm Definitely, I opened an issue [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/issues/556) and the problem initially seemed to be `protoc 3.4.0` and I was recommended to downgrade it to `3.3.0` but I still face the same issue when I clean and rebuild with `protoc 3.3.0` installed. I've put the stack trace in the latest comment over there. Would really love the help. Is there any more information I can provide to make it easier to debug?

Good news everyone,

many contributors have asked the team of Iroha maintainers before to fix build of Iroha in macOS environment. Since https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/565 was merged into develop — use can try to build Iroha and Iroha CLI on your Mac.
Also, this PR adds proto 3.4.0 compatibility and a new version of gRPC.  

We are on our way to release our alpha version with a new model of permissions and extended has/crypto capabilities. 

Also, we are going to restructure the docs and put them into one place alongside with video tutorials in a week.

Please, stay tuned to know more about Iroha project progress

I am interested in Iroha, read the documentation but still have some questions. As example the consensus algorithm BFT is called Sumeragi relies hevily on reputation system called Hijiri. If my understasnding is carrect I am trying to compare this with other concepts for truse induction like prove of stake or prove of work, POE.. Can someone clarify for me how consensus and trust work here? thank you

Currently hijiri and sumeragi are not used, so you must have read some very old documentation.

Hijiri is a system for managing a node's reputation based on benchmarks and is unrelated to the way Nakamoto Consensus "handles" trust. Right now Hijiri is not used in the current version of Iroha, but I would like to add it in a future version.

I'm reading the YAC consensus document and I'm trying to understand it better.  However the English is hard to follow in places and I've got some questions that I'm hoping you can clear up.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 01:12:12 GMT):<br/>
in section 4.1, the first step in the algorithm says, "OS share proposal to all nodes in cluster".  First of all, does "cluster" mean all of the nodes that are trying to come to consensus?  Which node puts together the proposal that gets shared?  Is there a leader?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 01:12:47 GMT):<br/>
does the sharing of the proposal use byzantine reliable broadcast to ensure that all nodes in the cluster agree on the proposal?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 01:16:46 GMT):<br/>
so there is a leader that is chosen by seeding a random number generator with the hash of the proposed block and that does a deterministic random ordering of the nodes in the cluster.  the node that comes first is the leader
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 01:18:10 GMT):<br/>
but the document also says that different nodes may reject different subsets of transactions and therefore come to a different conclusion on what the proposed block looks like.  that means each node could potentially calculate a different hash because they have different proposed blocks...that would give a different node ordering and a different leader.  Is that how this works?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Sat, 30 Sep 2017 01:18:35 GMT):<br/>
it is unclear how the different nodes come to consensus on which node is the leader

Hi! please execute `clean.sh` and rebuild Iroha in docker environment, as suggested here:
https://hyperledger.github.io/iroha-api/#build
</p>

But I can't find clean.sh.
Is it impossible to build the irohad on docker now?
Is there somebody who can't build on docker?

Thank you for your response.
Currently we are measuring performance using "v0.95 preview" in our system.
If alpha version is released, we plan to switch to it.
Therefore, we are concerned when the alpha version will be released.

I'm working on my PR #631 and it needs correction as I want this [commit](0ff9d0b5cfddb88c0e0704e3e11f15bac914c81a) to remove.
Could you please resolve this and let me know what other commits I have to sign? As I see that you already verified my commits with your sign and I signed only 2 of them, do I need to sign remaining four commits?

Thanks

hello guys what is the difference block, proposal and transaction in iroha?
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 16:29:00 GMT):<br/>
@jettcalleja. Hi! Transaction is a collection of commands to perform in Iroha (TransferAsset, CreateAccount, etc.). Each transaction must succeed or fail as a complete unit; it can never be only partially complete.
Block is a collection of transactions, which is stored in a chain of blocks (blockchain stores a history of blocks, being just a linked list of blocks).
Proposal is the internal representation of block. It exists while transactions were accumulated in single point, called ordering service, which orders transactions and emits this collection to peers — until the moment when the proposal is verified. After proposal is verified, and some metadata are attached, it becomes a block.
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 16:30:38 GMT):<br/>
Peers in the network should agree on the block (its internal contents, transactions). This process is called consensus. After consensus is done and all peers agreed on the block, each peer should append this block to their individual chain.
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 26 Oct 2017 16:30:43 GMT):<br/>
@jettcalleja hope this helps :)

Hi, so I am trying to build Iroha for the first time, and I get the following error:

[ 62%] Built target model
Makefile:94: recipe for target 'all' failed
make: *** [all] Error 2
I have no name!@7b9bd92fad5d:/iroha$ 
</p>
<p><strong>MattiaBradascio</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 14:29:22 GMT):<br/>
What exactly does this mean? and how can I go about solving it?
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 14:47:46 GMT):<br/>
Hi! Can you please use codebase from development branch, clean folder with `clean.sh` script and rebuild it once again?
</p>
<p><strong>AlvaroAcosta</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:22:42 GMT):<br/>
How can I upgrade docker, the version that I just installed is the 1.12 and I dont know how to upgrade to a proper version to run Iroha, I'm on windows 10 runing virtual machine ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Thanks in advance
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:48:05 GMT):<br/>
what do you mean by 1.12? iroha-docker:latest?
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:49:16 GMT):<br/>
I see, that is docker version
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 16:49:53 GMT):<br/>
can you describe your current problem with docker image upgrade? Can you just pull new docker image?
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 18:17:35 GMT):<br/>
@AlvaroAcosta : you might want to look at https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 18:19:08 GMT):<br/>
Also this might help: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Wed, 01 Nov 2017 18:19:20 GMT):<br/>
It will tell you how to remove old version

Hi Iroha team. With Sumeragi, are you forming consensus of transaction order, resulting state, both or something else?

Hi, I mean the database state, in terms of something like a merkle root over the database entries. Some blockchains seem to just enforce agreement on transaction ordering and others also check that the database contents itself is matching. Do you have a link to your block structure? That might answer subsequent questions too. Thanks!

<p><strong>john111</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 04:13:14 GMT):<br/>
where I can learn more about iroha. I couldn't find any docs or blogs on this topic
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 10:08:20 GMT):<br/>
Hi! A good starting point is https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/wiki
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 10:09:07 GMT):<br/>
there is a link to https://hyperledger.github.io/iroha-api which is a nice API description for current state of develop, however might have inconsistensies. Feel free to ask your questions at any time

>Hi Iroha team. With Sumeragi, are you forming consensus of transaction order, resulting state, both or something else?

Ordering service ensures everyone received the same "proposal" (proposal for changes) -- ordered set of transactions. After this, we do a consensus on resulting state.

Hi Iroha team! Readme mentions an alpha version due for Sept 2017. Any news about this?
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 13:58:36 GMT):<br/>
Hi! Yes, so far we want to include into alpha following:
Improved KYC schema
API for monitoring peers state 
iOS, Android and JS libraries

The reason for such delay is the misunderstanding of release lifecycle stages for hyperledger and our own understanding of them. We are discussing to release preview II version next week. Stay tuned!

<p><strong>Warchant</strong> (Sat, 04 Nov 2017 15:58:42 GMT):<br/>
@isaacn when you use CMake the first step typically is to generate Makefile: `cmake -H. -Bbuild`, then you build iroha itself. Warnings are OK. All dependendies should be downloaded during compile-time. To compile it, go to build directory and just write `make -j4` (4 - number of cores)
</p>
<p><strong>Warchant</strong> (Sat, 04 Nov 2017 15:58:57 GMT):<br/>
In case of any errors, please paste them there or open issue. Thanks! :)

Hi, when I run `./hakodate.sh` the CreateDomain transaction gives an error with message `Json transaction has wrong format.`. Does the shell script still work?

Hello iroha community.

Recently we released v0.95-preview-2 version. We mostly worked on improvements of existing algorithms and architecture, SDK and development process. 

Short changelog: 
- now we support "hot join of peers" -- new peers can join network during run-time.
- iroha now is compatible with MacOS, and arm-based architectures.
- implemented RBAC (role based access control) permission model.
- improved consensus.
- improved initialization.
- improved indices over blocks

More:
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/releases/tag/v0.95_preview-2

Please, do not hesitate to ask any questions :) 
Please, use github issues for bugreports, thanks!

I am new to Iroha, and managed everything to get working
</p>
<p><strong>KaiRaphixx</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 08:52:42 GMT):<br/>
But every time I try a transaction I get a broken crypto message. What am I doing wrong?
</p>
<p><strong>KaiRaphixx</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 08:53:49 GMT):<br/>
also "hakodate.sh" is not available in my examples folder, how can I get the sample script?

New announcement:

This week, on Friday we will have our first (after a long break) meeting with the community at 15:30 JST time (GMT+9).
The agenda is 
to explain the features from recent release really quick, 
tell about our decision with mechanism of collecting suggestions from contributors,
conduct Q&A session

Looking forward to see you there! I will post Zoom.us link here
</p>
<p><strong>KaiRaphixx</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 12:29:07 GMT):<br/>
@Warchant I use the develop branch
</p>
<p><strong>Warchant</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 12:29:55 GMT):<br/>
Please, describe your steps and we can check
</p>
<p><strong>KaiRaphixx</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 12:29:55 GMT):<br/>
There were also a few issues regarding the docker composer file
</p>
<p><strong>KaiRaphixx</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 12:30:41 GMT):<br/>
My steps where:
1. Creation of the genesis block
2. Running a few transaction with the iroha-cli in interactive mode
</p>
<p><strong>KaiRaphixx</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 12:30:58 GMT):<br/>
3. Tried my first transaction with a written json file: crypto error
</p>
<p><strong>Warchant</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 12:34:27 GMT):<br/>
it shows error for all transactions or for specific one?
</p>
<p><strong>Warchant</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 12:34:39 GMT):<br/>
did you try to create new transaction from cli?
</p>
<p><strong>Warchant</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 12:34:39 GMT):<br/>
did you try to create new transaction from cli?

UPD: Ah I see, you used interactive mode
</p>
<p><strong>KaiRaphixx</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 12:43:28 GMT):<br/>
The error is shown at every transaction after the faulty own json transaction
</p>
<p><strong>KaiRaphixx</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 12:44:06 GMT):<br/>
what is /code  "created_ts": int(13)
</p>
<p><strong>KaiRaphixx</strong> (Tue, 28 Nov 2017 12:44:06 GMT):<br/>
what is

hi everyone, when I run the command `irohad --config config.sample --genesis_block genesis.block --keypair_name node0` in the `example` directory I received this output:
`[04:35:36][th: 81][info] [MAIN] << start`
`[04:35:36][th: 81][info] [MAIN] << config initialized`
`[04:35:36][th: 81][info] [IROHAD] << created`
`[04:35:36][th: 81][info] [StorageImpl:initConnection] << Start storage creation`
`[04:35:36][th: 81][info] [StorageImpl:initConnection] << block store created`
`[04:35:36][th: 81][error] [StorageImpl:initConnection] << Connection localhost:6739 with Redis broken`
`[04:35:36][th: 81][info] [IROHAD] << [Init] => storage`
`[04:35:36][th: 81][error] [MAIN] << Failed to initialize storage`

What should I do?
</p>
<p><strong>Warchant</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 07:43:22 GMT):<br/>
In config.sample you should setup configuration for redis and postgres (host, port). And don't forget to start them.

Hello, I'm having difficulty with the setup of iroha. I'm not sure of the relationship with docker containers. I am using a virtual machine and installed the prerequisite software (Docker, Docker composer etc). However I can't seem to move forward as illustrated in the images above. I seem to be missing a step with the Docker environment. Can anyone assist please?
</p>
<p><strong>Warchant</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 17:53:07 GMT):<br/>
Hello @rteesdale , we do a lot of changes, so API and documentation may not be stable. We will go through the documentation once again and fix everything. Thanks ! :)

<p><strong>rteesdale</strong> (Wed, 29 Nov 2017 22:05:47 GMT):<br/>
Docker version is 17.09.0-ce; docker-compose is 1.8.0

Any action that changes the state is a transaction
</p>
<p><strong>Warchant</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 11:49:19 GMT):<br/>
Transaction consists of commands
</p>
<p><strong>Warchant</strong> (Thu, 30 Nov 2017 11:49:41 GMT):<br/>
You need command "TransferAsset"

Hi All

<p><strong>phariel</strong> (Fri, 01 Dec 2017 07:33:24 GMT):<br/>
How to comsume iroha API without iroha-cli?
</p>
<p><strong>phariel</strong> (Fri, 01 Dec 2017 07:37:19 GMT):<br/>
Is there any example for communicating with exposed port 50051 using grpc client?
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Fri, 01 Dec 2017 07:44:06 GMT):<br/>
you can form protobuf messages directly and send them to a peer
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Fri, 01 Dec 2017 07:44:42 GMT):<br/>
we expect to finish with .so library in C++ for forming transactions and queries on 11th of December
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Fri, 01 Dec 2017 07:45:02 GMT):<br/>
so that you can send them directly using SWIG bindings

Julian, sorry about that — they were in hakodate branch and were used before the checks of signatures were implemented. I am rewriting the docs at the moment, will post here when they are finished.
If you want to play around with Iroha and test the transactions or queries — please use CLI tool (iroha-cli). We are going to have a call tomorrow about upcoming release with library for Java and Python, so it can be used for transaction/query forming in the nearest future, so please join if you can.
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Fri, 15 Dec 2017 06:21:30 GMT):<br/>
As for ctest — it is the part of CMake, which you need to use to build the project. Please, install CMake

Hello, when installing Go Language, I’m unable to make sure that the source code is located within the $GOPATH. I have modified the .profile file with the following two lines - $ export GOPATH=$HOME/go and $ export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin — however when I rerun .profile file using $ source .profile I get the response ‘command not found’, does anyone know how to troubleshoot this please, many thanks

@Lesforest  is there something wrong example/config.sample?check your form of this file
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 26 Dec 2017 16:29:43 GMT):<br/>
@Rak : Do you have a `$` in front of your first export? This line should be `export GOPATH=$HOME/go`
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 26 Dec 2017 16:30:15 GMT):<br/>
Oh...same with your second line. It should be `export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin`
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 26 Dec 2017 16:30:38 GMT):<br/>
The `$` normally represents the prompt that you would see on your command line
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 26 Dec 2017 16:30:38 GMT):<br/>
The `$` at the beginning of a command normally represents the prompt that you would see on your command line
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 26 Dec 2017 16:34:35 GMT):<br/>
@Lesforest : I would guess that there is a problem with the `example/config.sample` file. Maybe try something like https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/ to validate the format of that file.

Hi all, I'm trying to build a simple iOS application sending command to iroha network running on a local machine. At the moment I've managed to generate the client side using grpc-swift starting from the proto definitions in the iroha project. Now every command or query I try to send to the network kill the irohad with the following error ```
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::invalid_argument'
  what():  blob_t: input string has incorrect length
./start.sh: line 1:  5383 Aborted
```
Any help or advise please on what can be causing this issue ?

Hi everyone, I had a quick question, Please pardon me if the question seems naive. How does iroha use android devices in the blockchain, are they used during consensus? It currently looks like only the key pairs are generated via the mobile app. How is its current implementation different from running a server using fabric and building an android app around it?

Hey Sudheesh, if you were to deploy a server running fabric and then making an Android app around it, how do you make the App architecture distributed then?

How to Add peers and connect two systems in hyperledger iroha
</p>
<p><strong>sudheesh001</strong> (Tue, 16 Jan 2018 14:05:13 GMT):<br/>
@ArcherN9 I am trying to understand `iroha-android` making it decentralized, it looks like only the `priv-pub` key pairs are being generated on the android device and nothing else, the same uses a specific host name to query to, the server which is present there will have the required APIs. So only the servers/peers are decentralized and that's the same in fabric. I am still trying to understand the difference

@sudheesh001 Don't get me wrong, I've no idea about the intricacies of `iroha-android`. That question was purely academic. 
So the app itself does not manufacture a block on the chain? But needs to communicate with the network using external API calls?
</p>
<p><strong>sudheesh001</strong> (Wed, 17 Jan 2018 05:42:44 GMT):<br/>
@ArcherN9 I completely understand your academic standpoint and the tone of the question. :)  you're right about the android app not by itself manufacturing a block on the chain, rather it seems to contact a single server endpoint as it looks here. https://github.com/soramitsu/iroha-demo-android/blob/master/ExamplePoint/app/src/main/java/io/soramitsu/examplepoint/IrohaApplication.java#L37 So that's the reason why my I had asked the question. There's a parallel discussion on the iroha gitter channel and it looks like more people want an answer/clarification to this question too. https://gitter.im/hyperledger-iroha/Lobby?at=5a5d7ee6ae53c15903f178c6

After you you successfully run `run-iroha-dev.sh` you can move to building the project. In iroha directory run 
`
cmake -H. -Bbuild;
cmake --build build -- -j$(nproc)
`

</p>
<p><strong>grimadas</strong> (Tue, 23 Jan 2018 07:25:17 GMT):<br/>
After that open new terminal and ./run-iroha-dev.sh for iroha-cli  
</p>
<p><strong>grimadas</strong> (Tue, 23 Jan 2018 07:25:35 GMT):<br/>
And run cli
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>grimadas</strong> (Tue, 23 Jan 2018 07:45:16 GMT):<br/>
In first terminal you run irohad, in second (new) iroha-cli to send transaction to local irohad

Everyone, having problems to start iroha with "redis error", you should change the config file. If you start iroha from the docker environment (running first "run_iroha_dev.sh"), the host in the config file should be changed. I prepared the modified version of the config for that

@DTLab Hi. Have you tried to compile and start iroha, it seems that the docker started anyway. We will check in the meanwhile

@rteesdale can you tell more details? Is this a master branch?
</p>
<p><strong>rteesdale</strong> (Mon, 29 Jan 2018 13:08:08 GMT):<br/>
@neewy Hi...I've compiled the develop branch found at this link: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha -b develop
</p>
<p><strong>rteesdale</strong> (Mon, 29 Jan 2018 13:11:37 GMT):<br/>
Let me know if you'd like me to try running specific commands. I've compiled under ubuntu linux Ubuntu Server 16.04.3 LTS. 64-Bit 
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Mon, 29 Jan 2018 13:21:23 GMT):<br/>
@rteesdale that's strange, it can be trouble with the boost. What version do you have?
</p>
<p><strong>rteesdale</strong> (Mon, 29 Jan 2018 13:29:57 GMT):<br/>
@Kitsu I should have boost 1_66. However, I am not near my dev machine now and will have to confirm the exact version installed. I definitely updated boost.
</p>
<p><strong>rteesdale</strong> (Tue, 30 Jan 2018 00:46:47 GMT):<br/>
Ok so...I verified that I installed boost 1_66 to a separate location. I also build iroha using the boost 1_66 (BOOST_ROOT) install path. I piped output of the ldd command on irohad to a text file. In the screen shot I show where it appears that irohad links to the correct version of boost. 
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>rteesdale</strong> (Tue, 30 Jan 2018 00:52:55 GMT):<br/>
Of course...the boost installation reported is lower....Because I extracted updated boost to my own location and pointed to it for build. Any insight will be appreciated. 
</p>

<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 30 Jan 2018 12:25:08 GMT):<br/>
This may be a problem with older one I think, it should be fine
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 30 Jan 2018 12:25:31 GMT):<br/>
Maybe there's some problems on the directory permissions? Just tested it, worked fine for me, hm
</p>
<p><strong>rteesdale</strong> (Tue, 30 Jan 2018 15:12:28 GMT):<br/>
@Kitsu ok...I will look over the directory permissions and also try to ensure that I am really loading the boost 1_66 libs

I'm having trouble with the command line interface
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Mon, 05 Feb 2018 20:37:21 GMT):<br/>
everytime I create a transaction it tells me that it hasn't passed stateless validation and i don't know how to debug this
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 10:43:16 GMT):<br/>
How did you create your transactions? Make sure that it fulfills the API requirements: https://hyperledger.github.io/iroha-api/#transactions
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 14:31:05 GMT):<br/>
I'm using the command line interface to create them
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 14:55:18 GMT):<br/>
@Kitsu do i need to launch the irohad client in order for the hash to send properly
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 18:27:13 GMT):<br/>
Yes, for now only irohad perform all validation
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 18:27:49 GMT):<br/>
Hopefully we're soon migrate to new one, so it will be much easier to understand the issue without the daemon
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 18:38:21 GMT):<br/>
I launched the irohad client
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 18:38:27 GMT):<br/>
and I tried to make a query
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 18:38:35 GMT):<br/>
it says this:
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 18:38:35 GMT):<br/>
it doesn't generate a hash
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 18:38:52 GMT):<br/>
or return an error

so when I send a transcation to a peer
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 19:59:01 GMT):<br/>
I do localhost then 10001 as the port correct?

<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:04:46 GMT):<br/>
what's the default value?

<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:04:57 GMT):<br/>

to exit the cli?
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:06:46 GMT):<br/>
or do I just ctrl + c

<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:07:22 GMT):<br/>
Hmm, there was a patch recently that allow to exit via ctrl+d
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:07:38 GMT):<br/>
I think ctrl+c also should work, maybe not that pretty
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:08:11 GMT):<br/>
okay so the query worked thanks for the help

<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:13:29 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:13:42 GMT):<br/>
why would i need a user named varun?

Also make sure it has required permissions, like can_create_role

<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:14:40 GMT):<br/>
That's basically the identification, you can't send txes anonymously
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:15:52 GMT):<br/>
but i see this in my genesis.block
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:15:55 GMT):<br/>
                {
                    "command_type": "CreateRole",
                    "role_name": "money_creator",
                    "permissions": [
                        "can_add_asset_qty",
                        "can_create_asset",
                        "can_receive",
                        "can_transfer"
                    ]
                },

</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:16:18 GMT):<br/>
The genesis block isn't validated, it just inserted
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:16:18 GMT):<br/>
The genesis block doesn't validated, it just inserted
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:16:18 GMT):<br/>
like a role named "money_creator" was made but not a user
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:16:23 GMT):<br/>
okay
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:17:32 GMT):<br/>
@Kitsu so I have to create a user called "varun" to create a role called "varun"?
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:17:44 GMT):<br/>
is that what you're telling me
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:18:25 GMT):<br/>
Here's the chicken and egg problem: you need a role for user creation and you need a user for creation a role
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:18:47 GMT):<br/>
That's why the only way is define one of it in genesis block
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:19:32 GMT):<br/>
Any role can be created by any user with required permissions 
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:19:44 GMT):<br/>
okay but I run the iroha-cli as an admin
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:19:48 GMT):<br/>
so the roles I create
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:19:52 GMT):<br/>
wouldn't they be under admin>
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:19:52 GMT):<br/>
wouldn't they be under admin?
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:20:37 GMT):<br/>
Mmm, not really, there's no "admin" here
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:21:22 GMT):<br/>
You may create a user with such a name and give it all of the permissions, and well, you may name it an administator account if you'd like
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:28:31 GMT):<br/>
so what permissions do these accounts have then
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:28:32 GMT):<br/>
                {
                    "command_type": "CreateRole",
                    "role_name": "money_creator",
                    "permissions": [
                        "can_add_asset_qty",
                        "can_create_asset",
                        "can_receive",
                        "can_transfer"
                    ]
                },

</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:28:37 GMT):<br/>
woops wrong thing
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:28:44 GMT):<br/>
                {

</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:29:10 GMT):<br/>
@Kitsu 
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:39:36 GMT):<br/>
Well, I'm not really sure
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:39:59 GMT):<br/>
I think the default role of domain apply and thus all of its permissions
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:41:11 GMT):<br/>
so why wouldn't i be able to create a role
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:41:14 GMT):<br/>
under admin@test?
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:43:19 GMT):<br/>
It hard to say without info about the other commands
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:44:10 GMT):<br/>
Firstly check the CreateDomain with the test domain, then check CreateRole with related domain default role
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:44:54 GMT):<br/>
Afair there's no `can_create_role` in default config
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:48:14 GMT):<br/>
I'm not really sure about the docs, you can find all permissions [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/develop/schema/primitive.proto), I guess they're pretty self-explanatory
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:49:03 GMT):<br/>
And [API docs](https://hyperledger.github.io/iroha-api/) may be useful about details of the command/queries
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:50:03 GMT):<br/>
I'm going to sleep, so if you still/will have any other questions I'll try to answer those at the morning :)
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:50:04 GMT):<br/>
alright i'll try creating a new user
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:50:08 GMT):<br/>
okay thank you
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:50:11 GMT):<br/>
for the help so far
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Tue, 06 Feb 2018 20:50:18 GMT):<br/>
hopefully creating a new user will solve my issue
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 14:18:52 GMT):<br/>
@Kitsu I created a user but its not showing up on my genesis block
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 14:19:03 GMT):<br/>
was it created in a separate block
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 14:19:12 GMT):<br/>
if so where could i find the location of the block
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:01:30 GMT):<br/>
If you created via iroha-cli it's obviously not in the genesis block
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:01:30 GMT):<br/>
If you created it via iroha-cli it's obviously not in the genesis block
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:02:01 GMT):<br/>
yes i found it
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:02:10 GMT):<br/>
but as a question 
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:02:15 GMT):<br/>
every time I run an instance of irohad
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:02:20 GMT):<br/>
does it delete all the blocks
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:02:27 GMT):<br/>
that were there previously in that file location
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:02:35 GMT):<br/>
cause I made an account in one instance of irohad
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:02:50 GMT):<br/>
then when I stopped irohad and reran it all my blocks were deleted along with the account
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:03:12 GMT):<br/>
Hmm, it shouldn't work like this
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:06:03 GMT):<br/>
should it save all of the blocks?
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:12:09 GMT):<br/>
Ah, well, my guess you specified the genesis block, that's why it's recreated
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:12:39 GMT):<br/>
how would i specify another block?
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:12:47 GMT):<br/>
or the most recent block on the blockchain
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:12:49 GMT):<br/>
Try without the `genesis_block` flag
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:13:13 GMT):<br/>
It's in redis/postgres already
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:13:24 GMT):<br/>
okay
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:13:29 GMT):<br/>
unless it havn't cleared ofc
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:13:46 GMT):<br/>
i have created an account
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:13:51 GMT):<br/>
using the genesis block account
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:14:00 GMT):<br/>
and its on the blockchain
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:14:06 GMT):<br/>
i have a file
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:14:25 GMT):<br/>
but I'm getting a key_pair error when I'm trying to rerun the iroha_cli client with that account
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:14:32 GMT):<br/>
is that because I'm running irohad on the genesis block
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:24:43 GMT):<br/>
try to query that account, there can be an error while inserting without validation
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:25:47 GMT):<br/>
yeah i've queried the accont
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:26:20 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:28:40 GMT):<br/>
Ok, looks good. So what's the issue withe keypair again?
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:29:20 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:32:55 GMT):<br/>
this is a better picture as you can see the key_path is in the same build as I'm currently in
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:32:55 GMT):<br/>
this is a better picture as you can see the key_path is in the same folder as I'm currently in
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:42:12 GMT):<br/>
How did you generate the keypair?
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:42:57 GMT):<br/>
iroha-cli --new_account --account_name alice@ru --pass_phrase mysupersecretpassword --key_path ./ 
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:43:15 GMT):<br/>
with the account_name being varun@test
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:43:39 GMT):<br/>
`--pass_phrase mysupersecretpassword` that's the reason
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:44:00 GMT):<br/>
whats' the issue with that
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:44:04 GMT):<br/>
that phrase is used to encrypt your key file
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:44:05 GMT):<br/>
I shuldn't have it at all?
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:44:19 GMT):<br/>
And then you try to load it as plain-text (w/o any password provided)
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:44:34 GMT):<br/>
so how do I load with the encrypted password
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:45:42 GMT):<br/>
Afair via the same parameter, pass_phrase
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:46:20 GMT):<br/>
yeah, just include `--pass_phrase <...>` and it should work
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:46:26 GMT):<br/>
okay it worked
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 16:46:31 GMT):<br/>
thanks
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 17:52:10 GMT):<br/>
@Kitsu so from my understand
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 17:52:10 GMT):<br/>
@Kitsu so from my understanding, the irohad client operates on one block in the blockchain?
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 17:53:27 GMT):<br/>
like if I initially run irohad client from genesis block, then I create a transaction that creates a new block correct
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 17:53:42 GMT):<br/>
so if I run the irohad client it runs from the most recent block right
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 18:15:42 GMT):<br/>
yeah I'm very confused how the flow of this program works
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 18:15:52 GMT):<br/>
if I launch an irohad client on my genesis block
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 18:15:58 GMT):<br/>
then i create an account
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 18:16:13 GMT):<br/>
It shows successfully a block was created with the transaction that shows a new user has been created
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 18:16:27 GMT):<br/>
but everytime I try to add a new role to that user it says the stateless validation failed
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:38:21 GMT):<br/>
@Kitsu whenever you are available I would like to know how to create a new role... for some reason it always tells me that it didn't pass the stateless validation. I tried creating a new account and using it but it hasn't been working.
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:45:56 GMT):<br/>
like by default none of the domains grant any permissions to create a role
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:46:02 GMT):<br/>
so how would I be able to create a role?
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:50:19 GMT):<br/>
like here I see in your github: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/develop/schema/primitive.proto
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:50:22 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=mJWnyF4Nb7bGdnXZQ) @Varoon_5 
Not really, it's operate via iroha's API, that's it. So it make either perform some transactions (and those occasionally will be committed as a block) or query this sequence of the blocks
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:50:52 GMT):<br/>
I understand how your API works now
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:50:59 GMT):<br/>
but I'm very confused
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:51:11 GMT):<br/>
how do I allow the permission to create a role?
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:51:21 GMT):<br/>
your github has it documented: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/develop/schema/primitive.proto
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:51:37 GMT):<br/>
You mean what's the required permission for command `CreateRole`?
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:51:44 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:51:56 GMT):<br/>
because I created multiple new accounts
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:52:03 GMT):<br/>
I guess `can_create_role`
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:52:16 GMT):<br/>
okay, but how do I grant that permission to my user?
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:52:36 GMT):<br/>
like in the genesis block
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:52:44 GMT):<br/>
none of the roles have that permission
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:53:22 GMT):<br/>
You can give such a permission to the user
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:53:39 GMT):<br/>
i tried your command grant_perm
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:53:41 GMT):<br/>
didn't work
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:53:48 GMT):<br/>

<br/><a href="./assets/a5E4mcY2rnYdaTqHv-Screenshot from 2018-02-07 14-53-27.png">Screenshot from 2018-02-07 14-53-27.png</a>
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:53:51 GMT):<br/>
But you can create a role with a subset of required permission and then add the role to the required user
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:54:12 GMT):<br/>
but my issue is I can't even create a role at all
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:54:34 GMT):<br/>
because my genesis block
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:54:37 GMT):<br/>
has roles defined
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:54:42 GMT):<br/>
user, admin, money_creator
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:54:50 GMT):<br/>
but none of those roles have the permission to create a role

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=hPnkziTcwhFgvyP28) @Varoon_5 that's a bug I guess and should be fixed
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:56:27 GMT):<br/>
okay
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:56:41 GMT):<br/>
And as for genesis, you just may add necessary permission to the genesis block
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:56:55 GMT):<br/>
so I can modify the genesis block
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:56:59 GMT):<br/>
to include that permission
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:57:03 GMT):<br/>
Yes, sure
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:57:05 GMT):<br/>
okay
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 19:57:12 GMT):<br/>
i'll try that right now
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 20:02:27 GMT):<br/>
@Kitsu didn't work
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 20:02:34 GMT):<br/>
i restarted my irohad client
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 20:05:17 GMT):<br/>
Let me check
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 20:09:11 GMT):<br/>
I've sent via json, works fine
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 20:10:23 GMT):<br/>
Same via interactive
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 20:12:31 GMT):<br/>
Check that out: https://asciinema.org/a/WzuCmbx1qmuISUZFpT5C9QkXd
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 20:30:24 GMT):<br/>
okay i'll take a look
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 20:39:30 GMT):<br/>
uh so 
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 20:39:36 GMT):<br/>
I'm able to do those exact commands
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 20:39:39 GMT):<br/>
you just did
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 20:39:42 GMT):<br/>
that's an issue for me
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 20:39:49 GMT):<br/>
but when I go to veryify the transaction hash
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 20:40:01 GMT):<br/>
it tells me that the stateless validation hasn't been passed @Kitsu 
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 20:40:12 GMT):<br/>
I didn't see that in your video
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 20:41:43 GMT):<br/>
Are sure that you're doing the exact same actions? The stateless invalid can be for numerous reasons, e.g invalid signature or too long name
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 20:43:38 GMT):<br/>
lemme send my terminal screenshots

Save the tx to json
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 20:50:49 GMT):<br/>
The issue is'nt really clear for me now
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 20:55:37 GMT):<br/>
if i specify like ./tmp
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Wed, 07 Feb 2018 20:55:43 GMT):<br/>
where will it be saved?

Hi.I am new to hyperledger and block chain concept..I need to know whether we can use iroha in existing Fabric Project..Any detail on it would be appreciated
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Thu, 08 Feb 2018 14:33:54 GMT):<br/>
@Kitsu yes i've generated a public key
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Thu, 08 Feb 2018 20:26:07 GMT):<br/>
@Kitsu so I'm logged into iroha-cli as an admin
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Thu, 08 Feb 2018 20:26:17 GMT):<br/>
which has the permission can_create_role
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Thu, 08 Feb 2018 20:26:29 GMT):<br/>
but its still getting stateless fail
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Thu, 08 Feb 2018 20:26:35 GMT):<br/>
when i try to create a roel
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Thu, 08 Feb 2018 20:26:35 GMT):<br/>

Well, it's hard to say without much of information you specified. If you interested in the interledger bridge it doesn't exist so far (and i guess it won't appear during some time)
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Thu, 08 Feb 2018 21:01:41 GMT):<br/>
And generally speaking: yes, you can use but it can waste some time (depending on your needs)

Yeah, I haven't search in details of that problem, I'll answer as soon as I find an answer/make a fix
</p>
<p><strong>crj</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 07:48:35 GMT):<br/>
Is it grant can_transfer
</p>
<p><strong>crj</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 07:50:52 GMT):<br/>
How to grant  permission to  another account  ?such as can_transfer  permission.

GM. I have a question- what are the plans for Iroha-iOS? Looks like the last commit was almost a year ago: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-ios/
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 11:49:15 GMT):<br/>
@Kitsu is there a special kind of syntax to add values to an asset?
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 11:49:21 GMT):<br/>
Because its also erroring for me
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 11:49:46 GMT):<br/>
I'm able to create an asset under a specific domain but when I try to give a user that specific amount of that asset
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 11:49:49 GMT):<br/>
it errors
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 12:36:42 GMT):<br/>
@Kitsu also how would i demonstrate immutability with this blockchain? Like you described as a work-around to modify the blocks in the blockchain itself
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 12:36:50 GMT):<br/>
to grant permissions, create roles etc.
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 12:38:00 GMT):<br/>
but shouldn't I not have the ability to modify blocks on the blockchain? Or else how can i demonstrate integrity and immutability, meaning if someone were to recover this data after a long period of time, how can they be confident that the data in the blockchain hasn't been tampered with
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 13:26:08 GMT):<br/>
Nope, it's not possible modify already committed blocks. These perms are just allowing to perform some actions
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 13:27:02 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=9bi5npbwJoNHghrby) @Varoon_5 did you try `AddAssetQuantity` command?

Wow, this is great, thank you for this. But lets wait until Monday. We will release some beta version of new library and after the release you can help. But this is quite simple task. All we do now is wrapping c++ code of common Iroha library and putting it in objective-c code, after this we will right Swift wrapper over objective-c code. After this we will put it in cartage and cocoapods.

@Kitsu having an issue with the block height
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 20:01:30 GMT):<br/>
on irohad
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 20:01:39 GMT):<br/>
so when i start an irohad session
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 20:01:44 GMT):<br/>
create some blocks
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 20:01:46 GMT):<br/>
then stop it
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 20:02:11 GMT):<br/>
then I try to relaunch the irohad client on my current blockchain
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 20:02:22 GMT):<br/>
it doesn't account for the previous hieght
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 20:02:29 GMT):<br/>
keeps resetting it at 2
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 20:02:30 GMT):<br/>
> [15:00:55][th: 1636][warning] [Simulator] << Last block height: 8, proposal height: 2
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 20:02:55 GMT):<br/>
you told me to run irohad again without the genesis-block flag
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Fri, 09 Feb 2018 20:02:58 GMT):<br/>
so I did this:
</p>

>./irohad --config config.sample --keypair_name node0

</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 18:16:17 GMT):<br/>
when I relaunch it on a preexisiting blockchain there seems to be a height issue
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 18:27:08 GMT):<br/>
it resets the hieght back to 2
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 18:27:14 GMT):<br/>
instead of keeping the current height
</p>
<p><strong>Varoon_5</strong> (Mon, 12 Feb 2018 18:27:35 GMT):<br/>
basically not allowing me to create new proposals cause of the height mismatch, so I cannot create new blocks on the blockchain

Hi! I'm a newcomer here, doing the Hyperledger Course on edX... And there's one question that I couldn't solve myself, which is:
What's the difference between the YAC and SUMERAGI Consensus Algorithms? Which one does Iroha really use? On the course they mention both but I don't know which one is it, or if it can use both. Thanks for your help!
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 21:06:40 GMT):<br/>
@CBerner Hey! Firstly there was a Sumeragi consensus, then after some research we adopted YAC (I think its development started in June or smth like that)
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 21:07:11 GMT):<br/>
For now there's only YAC in the repo, probably we'll add Sumeragi back at some time, not sure

<p><strong>srujana_k</strong> (Fri, 16 Feb 2018 11:27:49 GMT):<br/>
Hello everyone,

Regarding Hyperledger Consensus, I have some doubts ...

From the Document( https://www.hyperledger.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Hyperledger_Arch_WG_Paper_1_Consensus.pdf) it is mentioned "we ensure that any Hyperledger framework can work with any Hyperledger consensus module. "

so is it possible to use "sumeragi" of Iroha's consensus model in Fabric for ordering of transaction(i.e at Orderer) ?

As sumeragi is a chain based consensus, how can we use for Fabric consensus ? please share your thoughts and opinions on this..

Thank you! 
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Fri, 16 Feb 2018 14:25:33 GMT):<br/>
@srujana_k Check my messages above about Sumeragi
Regardless of consensus modularity it can be pretty hard to integrate the one into different platform. Mostly because of the difference in the APIs, partially due to languages diversity (iroha - c++, fabric - go, sawtooth - mostly python). These are mostly come from my own intuition, I'm not 100% sure about the statements

</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 08:24:13 GMT):<br/>

What exactly are redis and postgres used for in Iroha? I could not find any documentation regarding this.

We've removed redis recently, check out develop branch. Both are actually for caching current state (aka word state view/wsv)

@jtclark Hi Jason! We have finished with bridging header and cross compilation for iOS, so it would be great if you two have communicated.

<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Wed, 28 Feb 2018 02:18:05 GMT):<br/>
To all here who are curious about the project and updates, and the rest of the chat who also has some another interest — being honest with you the team of maintainers is not comfortable with RocketChat. Since the answers to your questions are not limited by the capabilities but mostly by the platform, I would strongly recommend you to join our telegram group in order to discuss any concerns you have. 

Telegram is used widely for the communication in the team, so here is the link — https://t.me/joinchat/AgzrTUCZ6edlj6V612n5JQ

Yet we are answering messages regularly with the help of our community managers in RocketChat, but it is not convenient for us to keep several channels serviced at the same level :)

@neewy : As you know, Hyperledger has brought the different projects into Rocket.Chat, and we would prefer that Rocket.Chat be the main channel instead of Telegram. cc:@dhuseby

<p><strong>jbrindle</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 14:48:58 GMT):<br/>
@Kitsu possible with current code? I assume that means building iroha into a jni? Will it compile against the NDK?

There is a bindings for java in the repo. Not sure about NDK, but @AlexeyMukhin is working on the iOS
</p>
<p><strong>jbrindle</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 14:59:35 GMT):<br/>
@Kitsu interesting, java bindings won't do any good if we can't build the cpp code against the ndk... I'll try this out at some point
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 15:02:00 GMT):<br/>
@jbrindle Well, generally speaking it should work (as long as we avoid system-dependent code), but probably there is can be some issues in build system

<p><strong>luckychess</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 15:05:20 GMT):<br/>
@jbrindle It's possible to use Iroha from Android; it requires to build part of Iroha (shared model if you want to know) with NDK. It's quite tricky and long process (I wrote a kind of how-to document but it does not contain small details of this process). If you do not want to do it by yourself I can build a shared object library for you tomorrow - unfortunately, such build is not automated for now.
</p>
<p><strong>jbrindle</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 15:06:26 GMT):<br/>
I definitely want to do it myself, but it isn't required right now, I'm writing a proposal to build something using this. The information is very helpful, thank you.

@MichaelCutrer First you run in one terminal `run-iroha-dev.sh`, and follow all the procedure related to `irohad`. At the end you should have `irohad` up and running. 
Open another terminal, and execute `run-iroha-dev.sh`, and start `iroha-cli`

@darsh7807 Actually docker is not necessary, you can run postgres on your host system. Just ensure it's available with parameters from config.sample (pg_opt).
Also irohad shouldn't segfault in a case when connection to postgres is not available. Could you please check your port 5432, may be you have some other service running in it? `netstat -tulpn` should do this job.

I had a question in reagarding the issue: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/issues/627 in the file `pb_query_factory_test` there are 5 comments saying:  `// TODO 26/09/17 grimadas: overload operator == for queries and replace with it IR-512 #goodfirstissue` What does IR-512 mean?
</p>
<p><strong>palash25</strong> (Fri, 16 Mar 2018 18:48:59 GMT):<br/>
I did `git grep IR-512` locally but all I got was those 5 comments.

Hi @Hatchi 1. 
Block doesn't have some defined limits for the block. Usually block size depends on the proposal size, which is affected by proposal_delay(the lower the smaller is the proposal). 
Iroha is suitable for multiple queries for free, for client it is computationally and memory cheap, as all complex operations are on the irohad side.
I would love to help you with your use-case if you can provide more details. 
What are the specifics for the IoT/Watson data? 
</p>
<p><strong>grimadas</strong> (Mon, 26 Mar 2018 12:15:48 GMT):<br/>
Hi @maxint. 
Possible "rainy days scenario" is when node is desynchronised. This can happen due to network failures, or malicious users. 
Each time upon receiving proposal or commit message, node checks whether it is synchronised.
1. Proposal has a sequential id, nodes compare last local proposal with upcoming proposals. 
2. Each commit message has proposal hash and block hash, and votes. If your vote is different - you are desynchronised.   
Votes are a wonderful way to get up up-to-date nodes. If you vote for majority you are most likely synchronised, so node fetch all missed blocks.

Hi. Is there a good example of a node.js and express.js web app with Iroha? 
</p>
<p><strong>cditzler</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 19:31:23 GMT):<br/>
Best I could find: https://github.com/soramitsu/iroha-demo-javascript

<p><strong>tamal610</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 06:00:54 GMT):<br/>
can anyone tell me, how to insert JSON object to network as asset?
</p>
<p><strong>tamal610</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 06:03:39 GMT):<br/>
Is there any api for that?
</p>
<p><strong>tamal610</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 06:33:01 GMT):<br/>
For example, As conventional database, i want to make a registration page where user can register for new account using iroha where user input name, fullname, address, age, dob, profilepic etc. Now my question is:
How can i insert users information by iroha command ? &
How can i search them using user's name/age/address?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=gQrQa4pNqesw3dMgW) @cditzler at the moment there is no _good_ example of a node.js app. However, you can try looking at ``example`` and ``tests`` folders [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/tree/develop/shared_model/packages/javascript) to get some inshights about how to use Iroha with Node.js
We are working on creating an example app.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=No5ZM7zKCMmN65Qrf) @BlackCat1397 blockchain systems are not that suitable for hosting at mobile devices, as they doesn't have much disk memory. I think "mobile first" is more about the ease of usage phones as clients and targeting SDKs for popular mobile platforms

Hi everyone. I have installed and launched Iroha on AWS, and am trying to play with the CLI. However I can't get any commands to work. No matter what I try to do(create an asset for example), I get a message that says "Parse params returned no value" and the transaction doesn't not show up on irohad.
</p>
<p><strong>rdugue</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 11:05:56 GMT):<br/>
If anyone has any suggestions as to what I am doing wrong, I would greatly appreciate it

@Kitsu I installed per these instructions: http://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/. I had irohad running in one terminal and the CLI in a second one. When I attempted to create an asset on the "test" domain, it gave me that error.

hi guys. i will be very glad if someone will describe to me what exactly is hyperledger iroha? is it a tool to create blockchains, like sawtooth or fabric? if so, what it have to do with android and iOS?
</p>
<p><strong>srcmake</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 18:03:51 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>srcmake</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 18:04:34 GMT):<br/>
It's supposed to just walk through Iroha for anyone new to anyone trying to use the system, by walking them through the actual command line stuff by explaining an example...
</p>
<p><strong>srcmake</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 18:05:19 GMT):<br/>
Are you sure it's okay @tkuhrt . Actually, I learned about contributing to Iroha from one of your videos, but your video was unlisted on youtube, so I wasn't sure if making this video was allowed or not.
</p>
<p><strong>srcmake</strong> (Wed, 25 Apr 2018 18:05:52 GMT):<br/>

I'll try to make videos/blog posts for other Hyperledger projects if I can.
</p>
<p><strong>srcmake</strong> (Fri, 27 Apr 2018 15:58:00 GMT):<br/>
But yeah. personally, when I started looking at hyperledger five days ago, I went straight to the training (https://www.hyperledger.org/resources/training) and videos section of the website.
</p>
<p><strong>srcmake</strong> (Fri, 27 Apr 2018 15:58:26 GMT):<br/>
To be honest, I was a bit disappointed because there weren't any direct links to tutorials to get started.
</p>
<p><strong>srcmake</strong> (Fri, 27 Apr 2018 15:59:12 GMT):<br/>
And the other thing that I saw about the blog posts were that...they were actually of people talking about hyperledger or the applications of hyperledger. Which is cool and all, but not really that helpful for developers trying to use hyperledger.
</p>
<p><strong>srcmake</strong> (Fri, 27 Apr 2018 16:00:06 GMT):<br/>
I don't mind if the video gets put on one of those webpages. (Unless there are already getting-started resources. But I didn't see anything THAT helpful when I looked on the website before.)
</p>
<p><strong>srcmake</strong> (Fri, 27 Apr 2018 16:00:30 GMT):<br/>
(Just being honest here, as you guys know I just started using hyperledger recently so I have that "new person" experience.)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=v5EB6iQCnrJX8zCbb) @mgcox Well, in my opinion is quite simplier. But I do not sure that the crutocurrency is a good usecase for the permissioned blockchain at all. Try to analyze the type of system (maybe in our [docs](http://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html) or more detailed [there](https://medium.com/@akadiyala/nuances-between-permissionless-and-permissioned-blockchains-f5b566f5d483)) and if you are sure that this kind of ledger suits you, than take a look at our [docs](http://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [examples](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/tree/master/example) folder.

Hi I am researching consensus algorithm used in different Hyperledger projects and am wondering what is Iroha's consensus algorithm? The wiki has Sumeragi but other sources have YAC (Yet Another Consensus). If it's YAC (Yet Another Consensus), could someone please point me to where I can find documentation or even code that supports it. Thank you!
</p>
<p><strong>Kitsu</strong> (Sun, 29 Apr 2018 09:51:12 GMT):<br/>
Hey @MabelOza! We had Sumeragi, but decided to move to YaC some time ago (I don't know/remember why). The code you may found is [there](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/tree/master/irohad/consensus/yac), though it lack of some features support. What kind of research do you have? Business application, scientific one or some other?
</p>
<p><strong>MabelOza</strong> (Sun, 29 Apr 2018 15:35:10 GMT):<br/>
Thank you @Kitsu I am doing a presentation for a class and meetup so I was hoping to find the design documents, something I could use to explain YAC to a wider audience. If it's not available, going through the code could work. Thank you again!

Hello! I'm interested if Iroha has light clients (which only download block headers as they appear and fetch other parts of the blockchain on-demand).
</p>
<p><strong>grimadas</strong> (Fri, 04 May 2018 02:33:08 GMT):<br/>
Hi @BlackCat1397! Right now clients don't have special verifications, as they trust some irohad node. 
We will add Merkle proof for the transactions and any query verification.
Currently if client doesn't trust a node, it can send same query to 1/3 + 1 of nodes. If all nodes answer similarly the query is right, if there is at least one node who disagrees, you need to query 2/3 + 1 nodes and choose the most popular answer.         
</p>

Hi, I'm getting confused by all the projects from hyperledger, but i'm looking for a blockchain where they are Validators where only them can send transaction to adresses where they aren't privatekey generated, and where transaction body can be anything, not "amount" of a cryptocurrency

I looked at the Genesis block.
In command payload, AddPeer peerkey's value is not the same with actual peer's pub key. Is the key value encoded something?

These values should actually be the same if compared bitwise. To verify that, you can either:
- translate base64-encoded string into hex string (using bash one-liner: `printf $peerKey | base64 -d | xxd -pu`). This should result in a string that matches the contents of `node0.pub` file
- translate hex encoded string into base64-encoded value (using bash: `printf $contentsOfNode0PubFile | xxd -r -p | base64`). This one should result in a base64-encoded string that matches the value of `peerKey` variable
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 17:30:33 GMT):<br/>
*[Artyom Bakhtin]* _via telegram_
It is not a bug. But I agree that peer's key encoding format should be consistent across configuration files.

Moreover, we have fairly well documented guide on deploying multi-node Iroha network using Ansible. So you don't even actually need to manually configure anything but major information about the nodes you want to deploy Iroha to.

I believe it's the problem with genesis block, probably with permission name
Could you send a whole genesis file here?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 10:12:23 GMT):<br/>
*[Kyuhyun Shin]* _via telegram_
I make docker container again(pure iroha:latest, not my custom image).
and I copy all node keypair & peers.list 
and i try again then genesis_block is successfully generated.

i think the environment inside the container seems to be broken because I installed ansible in it.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 10:13:29 GMT):<br/>
*[Kyuhyun Shin]* _via telegram_
There is no genesis_block file.
The reason I entered the iroha-cli command was to generate the genesis_block file using the iroha-cli tool, not to interact with the iroha network.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 10:19:30 GMT):<br/>
*[Artyom Bakhtin]* _via telegram_
btw, we have Iroha binaries that do not require installation on a host OS (https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/releases/tag/v1.0.0_beta-2). You can generate genesis block using `iroha-cli` from this package. In order to make `iroha-cli` accessible within Ansible run, just add this binary to your `PATH` environment variable.

Ah, sorry, missed you point. Then it's probably a bug, because we don't have any regressions for cli
Do you mind opening an issue?
Also you still should be able to create one via `--genesis_transaction`, that require a file with json transaction

btw, we have Iroha binaries that do not require installation on a host OS (https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/releases/tag/v1.0.0_beta-2). You can generate genesis block using `iroha-cli` from this package. In order to make `iroha-cli` accessible within Ansible run, just add this binary to your `PATH` environment variable.

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 06:24:16 GMT):<br/>

node != user.

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 07:04:01 GMT):<br/>
*[Vyacheslav Bikbaev]* _via telegram_
Well, currently you need at least one admin account to create other accounts, otherwise you won't be able to create more users (since there will be noone to sign transactions)
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 07:06:30 GMT):<br/>

should admin keypair be on every node? where does the newly created account keys reside?

it depend on your design.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 07:07:56 GMT):<br/>
*[Vyacheslav Bikbaev]* _via telegram_
No. To create an account, you need only public key. Genesis block contains is, so the keypare in "example" is just for convenience :)
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 07:08:48 GMT):<br/>
*[Vyacheslav Bikbaev]* _via telegram_
You need an admin keypair to create/sign transactions as admin. But nodes should not contain it (well, there is no need in it)
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 07:09:59 GMT):<br/>
*[Ons Kali]* _via telegram_
so if I understand right, signing a transaction can occur in any node, in that case should a node need the admins private key to do the signing?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 07:11:12 GMT):<br/>
*[Kyuhyun Shin]* _via telegram_
node is not a user.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 07:11:13 GMT):<br/>
*[Vyacheslav Bikbaev]* _via telegram_
No. The client signs their transaction. Iroha network can have a lot of clients. Client != Node.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 07:12:22 GMT):<br/>
*[Ons Kali]* _via telegram_
ah ok. so then client needs the private key to sign?

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 07:25:16 GMT):<br/>
*[Makoto Takemiya]* _via telegram_
No. The keypairs are used to digitally sign data, which can then be verified.

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 07:25:54 GMT):<br/>

In command payload, AddPeer peerkey's value is not the same with actual peer's pub key. Is the key value encoded something?

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 09:53:11 GMT):<br/>
*[Artyom Bakhtin]* _via telegram_ _forwarded from Artyom Bakhtin_
These values should actually be the same if compared bitwise. To verify that, you can either:
- translate base64-encoded string into hex string (using bash one-liner: `printf $peerKey | base64 -d | xxd -pu`). This should result in a string that matches the contents of `node0.pub` file
- translate hex encoded string into base64-encoded value (using bash: `printf $contentsOfNode0PubFile | xxd -r -p | base64`). This one should result in a base64-encoded string that matches the value of `peerKey` variable

I have the same problem with both master and develop. It is related to the fact that my UID is 1001 but the user iroha-ci within the container has ID 1000. 

I have solved it by modifying the script in question in the following way:

Hi guys again. Installing cmake 3.11 didn't solve the following problem about protobuf:

CMake Error at cmake/protobuf.cmake:55 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Protobuf" with any
  of the following names:

    ProtobufConfig.cmake
    protobuf-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Protobuf" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Protobuf_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "Protobuf" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.

ideas?

The last message -- stateful failed -- means that the tx has correct values in fields, but it is possible that user does not have enough amount, doesn't have permissions, or key does not belong to him -- generally what involves the state of the chain.

Hello, Iroha community. We are wanting to update the [free EdX course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS171x+3T2017/course/) that has a chapter on Iroha. When we initially did the course, it was when Iroha was going through some large changes. Now that Iroha is closer to its 1.0 release, it would be great if the Iroha community could make the chapter closer to those of Sawtooth and Fabric and update any material that may be out of date. We would definitely like to include information on setting up and using Iroha. Any takers to help with developing/updating the course material?

@x3medima17 when I use the lib from maven central, the java classes doesn;t have package names, and I cant use it ..

That's a known issue, we are working on packing everything in a package 
For now, it does not depend on the way you build the lib

Looking forward to it! Makoto helped a lot, which was well-appreciated since he was sick during the time I kept bugging him about the capabilities. 

People were surprised that I wasn't using Hyperledger Indy, but Hyperledger Iroha was a better fit for what was needed. 

There's a bunch of stuff not included in the report though given the technical detail of it (I assume it would've made other people bored), but if there is a full report with it, I'll post it here. Right now everything I sent to them is under ownership by the European Commission, so I cannot share what I sent unfortunately.

added new peer through the java sdk 
copied genesis block, newly generated key pair (node1.pub, node1.priv) to node1

I thought genesis block should not touched once its created and should be the same on all peers, thats why I am trying sdk to add peers dynamically.

but what triggers the synchronization after adding the new peer to the ledger? there are two cases here: 1. peer added to the ledger, but it is not started yet. 2. peer added to the ledger and it is already running. I am not understanding the synchronization process between the two cases.. Is there a doc somewhere that describes how this works?

The synchronization is triggered when a peer cannot apply recieved commit

@onskali @kitsu  The presented Blockstore looks like this.
Block 1 is the content executed by GenesisBlock.
In Block 2, admin@testdomain is executing CreateDomain test, user.  Because CreateDomain testdomain is executed with GenesisBlock and CreateAccount admin@testdomain is also executing, this CreateDomain is successful.
But Block 3 and Block 4 have no Command. Therefore, I do not know what transaction you issued, but probably it is AddPeer.
n the current implementation of Iroha, such a block is recorded when an error occurs in SFV. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the cause of SFV error.
Unfortunately, the cause of SFV error is not logged in the current log of Iroha. Therefore, you will need to investigate the cause from the contents of the transaction you issued.

Today is Thursday, so it is time to post our (ir)regular *Iroha* _(bi)_ *Weekly Update*!

*We’ve merged MST*! https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1260 and you can already try it  However, this feature is _very_ experimental, so 🐞 are possible, but we are improving it continuously https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1369, https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1386

Another important update (though it is not a feature): the long-awaited *Permissions documentation*!. https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/maintenance/permissions.html

Some news about client libraries: Now we build *Python🐍* and *Java☕ bindings* for *Windows users*! https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1358 Also, we sign our artifacts with GPG now https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1313 Soon we will update our bindings in `PIP` and `Maven`, stay tuned 🙂 Also, we’ve added more checks to our stateless validation https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1370
One more secret ㊙️ bindings update: we are working on *native JS library* https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1375 (no more Node modules!) You can already try it https://www.npmjs.com/package/iroha-lib/v/0.1.1 However this is a very early version, beware the 🐛! 
*Major CI update*: we are reworking our *CI pipeline* (WIP): https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1392 this will allow faster PR reviews and faster CI checks/test runs.

We’ve dealt with several 🐛, for example, a race condition in block query (it prevented making a lot of queries in a quick succession) https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1396, strange synchronization bug (it prevented the synchronisation between a newly added node and all other ones) https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1390
 
Now we support `dbnname` PostgreSQL parameter: it makes testing easier and now we can run tests in parallel. https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1277 
As usual, we are working hard on making our codebase cleaner: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1397,  https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1388, and so on 🙂 

And my favourite part – *work of our contributors*:
*uditha-atukorala* have added GetAccountAssetTransactions to our CLI! https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1323 🎉🎉🎉
*sjashwin* is improving our CLI as well! https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1316
*ZeekHuge* is working on improving our ironad https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1300
*onsjkm* and *walkero* are helping with package names for our Java bindings (https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1382, https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1340) 

There are some _good-first-issues_, for example, https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/issues/1362 strange iroha-cli boost exception. We need your help!

Thanks to our community: friends, you empower and inspire us every day!

It depends on your application, can you provide more details ? 
What is the data you need to store? 
Do you need to calculate, compute something in a decentralized manner?

Actualy, we are considering creating some sort of “web” interface in future, but it is not our top-priority task, to be honest. Now we are working on “Iroha-wallet”, which is a demo electron-based iroha wallet, which will help user manage their assets 🙂 This could be considered a first step towards web interface.

Hi everyone!
Trying to launch SwiftyIrohaExample (https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-ios). Building fine but transactions have invalid timestamps.
>>Transaction: [[bad timestamp: too old, timestamp: 1, now: 1528127061928 ]]
</p>
<p><strong>BlackCat1397</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 15:50:28 GMT):<br/>
The "createdTime" field in transaction is OK, so I'm completely lost. Can't find where that timestamp is invoked.
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 20:05:50 GMT):<br/>
Iroha experts: The Hyperledger T & E WG approved today the following: "•Proposed transaction: Let us select the 15 most essential concepts (is not terms) in Fabric, Sawtooth, Burrow and Iroha, and describe clearly, using illustrating relevant examples, understandable to end users and management, how they relate, overlap and where they are different; look forward to endorsements."

On behalf of the WG I submit to you the first two concepts descriptions:   A blockchain is an append-only data structure; a blockchain (instance) consists at any moment in time of a number of blocks. A block contains a number of transactions. The contents of a block is encrypted and each block contains a hash of major parts. It contains also a copy of the hash of the previous block and this is the reason for the term chain. A transaction proposal is a proposal by a client application or administrator to the blockchain network community. The network community can decide to make the transaction proposal a valid transaction, or is classified as an invalid transaction. Please let us know which improvements you want to make to these two concept definitions. Thanks

This is a javascript library issue in iroha-lib.

The return values ​​of the getTxCounter () and getCreatedTime () methods of the Command.Payload object seem to be reversed.

Calling the getTxCounter () method returns the creation time, and calling the getCreatedTime () method returns the txCounter value.

*[Arseniy Fokin](https://t.me/stinger112)* _via telegram_
Dear colleagues!

After some investigation of the problem with UTF characters in fields of Iroha transactions and queries we came to the following conclusion:
For now *only ASCII-compatible UTF strings supported*. This is related with an internal Iroha's implementation of string types: because we are using `std::string` as a base string type any non ASCII characters can't be safely written into fields.

E.g. when you are using non-ASCII UTF string for some field you are being able to set and even get it *only* in those languages where string types based on UTF. But if you are trying to get this string in languages where string types are in ASCII, you meet decoding problems.

So, you still _can write any string directly or by some helper methods_, but we can't ensure a behaviour when you will try to get it back.

To Iroha experts 
Some history
The Hyperledger T & E WG approved June 4th the following: "•Proposed transaction: Let us select the 15 most essential concepts (is not terms) in Fabric, Sawtooth, Burrow and Iroha, and describe clearly, using illustrating relevant examples, understandable to end users and management, how they relate, overlap and where they are different; look forward to endorsements."

On behalf of the WG I submit to you the first two concepts descriptions: A blockchain is an append-only data structure; a blockchain (instance) consists at any moment in time of a number of blocks. A block contains a number of transactions. The contents of a block is encrypted and each block contains a hash of major parts. It contains also a copy of the hash of the previous block and this is the reason for the term chain. A transaction proposal is a proposal by a client application or administrator to the blockchain network community. The network community can decide to make the transaction proposal a valid transaction, or is classified as an invalid transaction. Please let us know which improvements you want to make to these two concept definitions. Thanks
Current situation
•	SjirNijssen 19:44 
@KellyCooper @roleybrown @amundson @dan @yacovm @tkuhrt and members of the Training & Education WG, The feedback of amundson is incorporated, as well as Dan's and Tracy's. The feedback of yacov about the concept hash has hastened the introduction of concepts lists per audience; the feedback of Yacov was probably directed towards computer scientists or software engineers and I did not want to go that deep for decision makers and end users. So yacovm when we move up through the six audiances you suggestions will there get additional space. 
The response to the first two concept definitions has been encouraging. As a result there are now in the second increment 8 concept definitions. The proposal has been extended to make the concept list specific for 6 audiances, decision makers and end users, blockchain architects and blockchain consultants, admins, client application developers, smart contract developers and Hyperledger Platform developers. Everyone is invited to add his suggestions at https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/training-and-education/list-of-blockchain-core-concepts Thanks for your help. Please consider the list of 8 definitions and let us know whether we need to give additional attention to Iroha concepts; your suggestions are very welcome. Thanks for your attention.

while going through getting started section of Iroha's documentation, launching irohad is resulting in a runtime error. Please help me out.

Today is Thursday – time for the first *Iroha (bi)Weekly Update* of the Summer!

We have started our work on *BFT ordering service* 🎉!  You can track the progress here: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/tree/trunk/bft_os

*Important*: we have changed the response of `getAccountAssets` query. Now it returns all assets of the account, not only the one passed: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1402 We are considering adding separate query for getting one asset though.

Finally fixed the infamous *iroha-cli genesis block generation bug* 🎉🎉🎉 https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1351, thus resolving https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/issues/1362

Our new core team member *Akvinikym* is *optimising Iroha compile time*: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1424, https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1414

We are working on our docs (as usual): Docs about transaction statuses http://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core_concepts/glossary.html#transaction-statuses, entity-relationship model: http://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core_concepts/er_model.html, few words about MST: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1417. Also we are planning to make *Getting started* section simpler: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1418

Still improving our *Windows* support❤️: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1454, https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1457; removing legacy code, e.g. https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1436, https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1422, working on iOS shared model: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1449

*Community contributions:*
*sjashwin* is working on https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/issues/724, [WIP] https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1318
*ZeekHuge* is improving our ironad [WIP] https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1300
*onsjkm* and *walkero* fixed package name of Java bindings (https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1382, https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1340). We have merged only one of those PRs, because they were fixing the same problem, however we are sincerely grateful to both our contributors: thanks for the incredible work🙌!

Don’t forget to ask all your questions here. Also, you can always create issues at https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/issues

I am actually developing a EHR(Electronic Health Record) based application that will be decentralised.
So can I use Iroha for that?
I tried Solidity, but its support system and in general commands are very restrictive.

Iroha as a data layer platform is a good choice. You can use role-based access control and operate with existing entities. I would definitely say yes. Some of the use cases I may forsee require tailoring with a middleware layer of logic (e.g. Java or Python code) but this would not be too much

Please try using `Master` branch and `hyperledger/iroha: latest` image. Also please make sure you are using 0.1.4 version of Iroha-lib. We are working on making iroha-lib work with develop right now :)

If you want to use `develop` branch and image, you can try building lib yourself following http://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/libraries/nodejs.html#building-manually

Hi Newbie! Each user is identified as account_name@domain — such taxonomy better reflects use cases that we had in mind while designing the state + some permissions depend on domains, and you can have access logic which depends on domains

It has been a pleasure reading the iroha documentation. Thank you. I am a noobie and I couldn't conceptualize some of it. 
I am planning to link an iroha database in my current Android app just to store transaction details. It is sort of a crowd funding app for Ngos and I want it to be transparent. Can I use iroha so that every donations of user get stored in the block chain through the app and they can retrieve info on the status of their donation? If so, can you please tell me the steps in short how to achieve it and atomate the process? Thanking you in advance. :)

Imagine a medical institution registered as a ``hospital`` domain in Hyperledger Iroha. This domain has certified and registered workers each having some role, e.g. ``physician``, ``therapist``, ``nurse``. Each patient of the hospital has an account with full medical history. Each medical record, like blood test results, is securely and privately stored in the account of the patient as JSON key/values. Rules in ``hospital`` domain are defined such that only certified medical workers and the user can access the personal information. The medical data returned by a query is verified that it comes from a trusted source. Also, there is another `hospital2`, where the same account would like to have its account. Across separate domains there are permissions which help to overview data in the whole system, but also there are permissions which limit access only to the data which are in the same domain as the user that creates query

`npm install iroha-lib`
It works with the latest master branch. 

After it you can look at the example https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/tree/master/example/node (however version of lib must be 0.1.4) or at https://github.com/soramitsu/iroha-wallet-js/tree/develop

Basically, API is pretty much the same for every language.

If you try to transfer “asdvas” amount of asset, it will fail stateless-ly, because it is “invalid input”. If you try to transfer 100000 of asset, but only have 100, it will fail statefull-ly. Or, for example, if you don’t have a permission to transfer assets.

Hi Rohit! You cannot write custom logic in Iroha, but you can extend this with middleware server, based on our client library. Combined with multisignature mechanism this might be better at some point than chaincode-based interfaces, but we do realize that this is what we have to deliver in the future in our platform — at least at the level of definition of custom queries.

Can you please tell more what is a "donation status"?
What I would do is I would create a service that has an account in Iroha. This account has powers to issue donation tokens, and transfer them to other users.
In order to create new users, I would make a registration service, that has an account in Iroha with rights to create new accounts. Actually you can combine both services and make it so that each new user has some donation tokens.
Then I would introduce "projects", which are the accounts in Iroha, which have rights only to receive assets. History of transactions will indicate which account have invested in which project, and this might be available to an account with role to see history of all transactions in a whole system (or in a domain if you want to make it so that history of transactions might be visible to some accounts within a project only).

It is Thursday, our contributors 🎉!

Week highlights 🔥:

Block streaming API 📦. This would allow people to create services around Iroha that can listen to events happening on the chain — like specific transactions. In the future, it would allow us to implement block explorer functionality as well. 

Currently open PRs:
1) Get top block https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1472/files
The name says it all — there is now a possibility to get a last block from the chain. Although this is an internal interface its implementation on a client-side can be easily done with our contributors #help-wanted
2) Fix of validation for block query https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1488
This bug was sending everyone stateful error if someone had queried a block incorrectly.
3) Block streaming interface in gRPC https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1460
Iroha accounts would be able to get blocks in an async approach over this interface.  

Merged:
1) BlocksQueryBuilder https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1446
Helps to query blocks on the client side.
2) Query processing for blocks  https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1438  
After a query is sent it should be processed in the pipeline. This code delivers logic related to propagation of query to validation and execution components.

The batch of transactions 📑. This is actually a nice extension for our financial use cases, especially DVP settlements or exchanges — imagine an account A in Iroha that wants to exchange its assets with another account B. To do so, this account A is going to form a batch of transactions, which will contain:
1) Outgoing transaction with assets from this account A.
2) Another transaction of account B which transfers assets to account A (amount is specified by account A).

Only when both accounts A and B sign the batch and they have enough assets — the transactions are going to be applied atomically.
 
Currently open PRs:  
1) Transaction sequence interface https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1469

Check our progress of API improvements at feature sprint here: https://soramitsu.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=9&projectKey=IR&sprint=63

Stateful validation responses ✅. Many people were confused with lack of exact reason why their transaction has failed (in logs and on the client side). In order to help everyone, we are implementing Result class which tells what went wrong to the transaction creator and maintainers of Iroha peers: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1486 (in progress)

QA activity is depicted at a corresponding JIRA board here https://soramitsu.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=9&projectKey=IR&sprint=64
As usual, we continue with acceptance tests, small issues, but there is something more…

Binary Testing Framework 🔮! https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1485 

BTF allows performing stateful validation for transactions and queries built using client libraries.
For now, only Python is supported. Java support will be added later on. This code will help us build genesis block generation, client-side tests, and many more things!
Please check this out, BTF can give you more ideas on how to use our libraries for your projects.

Our effort related to optimizations of build time and transactions throughput has given its first results, as for now our test command with validation logic performed completely in storage layer has shown 2.5 times better performance than its previous implementation. Our general insight is that we need to minimize the number of queries to the database and transfer all the validation logic completely to storage.

Our common part of the weekly report is community effort ❤️:
Unfortunately, there were no active contributors this week and we need your help with many things, namely:
- feature development
- QA and documentation
- optimizations

Fabric is a good tool, but there are different factors that might affect your choice:
- Level of maintenance required. From my perspective and experience infrastructure required for Fabric is more complex and requires bigger support team
- Effort required to implement such use case. We already have this logic in account details, where you put such data. In Fabric you would have to implement this manually.
- Maturity of the system. If you think that you need to select a tool that has more time in production — you might pick Fabric, although Iroha is in beta state already and we are shipping our next beta release tomorrow.

I hope that it was helpful

Anyway, let say I plan to implement a Medical Records with Iroha. Then I create domain for each hopital. Then I create to create account for each patient. 

I'm not sure if I miss step by step to do this somewhere. I managed to create a new domain and create users inside the domain. But it seem like I don't have authorize to make any change to the account.

In the document, everything work pretty well with domain test.
I think that would be helpful to us if there is also a pre-course for us to take and run through 1 setup on a new domain rather than working on test domain.

Hope I don't miss that document somewhere :D

To be honest I am not sure what you mean.
Domain is a logical entity in the state which has some accounts in it. Also assets are created in the domain and thus you can have for instance `usd#usa` and `usd#jpn`. All permissions related to queries have different levels, so that some accounts can check only their information, information in the whole system, and information in the domain where an account was created. 

You can create new domain and set a default role in the system. Iroha supports RBAC, and accounts are assigned roles, not permissions.

You can create new domain by:
1) Including it in a genesis block
2) Creating a domain with an account which has rights to do so

After creating a domain and account in that domain, maybe I miss the step on assigning the authorization on the account to manage that new domain.

At the moment, I'm using account admin@test 
- create a new domain @farm1 
- create a new account admin@farm1 
- create asset cow#farm1
*** Then I try to add 5 cows to admin@farm1 but I got no authorize to

1) Creating read-only channel with weekly updates and forwarding messages here?
2) Creating a separate chat for API discussion and change requests?

Hyperledger Iroha v1.0 beta-3 version

n this release following changes were made:

Experimental multi-signature transactions support

This is one of the most important features so far, since it allows integrators of Iroha to customise validation logic and may help people who want to have smart-contracts support. Let me tell you more:

As per definition of multi signature account on wikipedia, it is a type of account, which has a special condition, associated with the account: it is related to a number of cryptographic signatures required to issue valid transactions from the account, or "quorum". Quorum is a requirement to have M of N signatures, attached to transaction, where N is a total number of public keys associated with the account.

It helps to build following logic:

in order to form a valid transaction a user of Iroha has to apply several keys distributed across several people or devices to her transactions
in order to form a valid transaction a user of a service with Iroha may send her transactions to a service, which validates some custom logic (amount of transferred assets, special fields, whatever) and this service can add a signature to transaction if it passed custom validation
What is different in Iroha, compared to other services, is that a user is able to send transactions to peer network which don't have all required signatures, "half-baked". Iroha puts them in a temporary storage and distributes across the network. In the end, when Iroha peer network has received enough "half-baked" transactions (quorum condition is valid) such transaction is sent to Iroha validation and is written in the ledger in case of successful validation.

If you are curious — check code in #1260. Docs are going to be available gradually in our documentation website.

Block streaming

This would allow people to create services around Iroha that can listen to events happening on the chain — like specific transactions. In the future, it would allow us to implement block explorer functionality as well.

Python and Java Bindings for Windows platform

Check it in #1335 and at artifact.soramitsu.co.jp website

Other features

All assets now are returned instead of a single asset in GetAccountAssets (#1402)
Permissions are now implemented as enums instead of strings (#1444, #1434, #1407, #1408, #1384)
Ability to specify postgres database name on irohad startup
Improved stateless validation for precision (#1370)
Reduced CPU usage caused by compilation of regexes (#1345)
Protobuf schema changes causes automatic generation of cpp files on build (#1441)
Hash can now be created from hex string (#1475)
Overwriting existing genesis block requires approval on Irohad start (thanks to @ZeekHuge) (#1300)
CLI now supports GetAccountAssetTransactions command (#1323)
Significant compilation time improvements for irohad (#1424, #1414)

Get down, it is Saturday update 🎉

Week highlights 🔥:

*Major*
New Jenkins continuous integration and delivery pipeline. Our DevOps engineers in maintainers team (@tyvision95) have designed and implemented new unique pipeline that supports CVS schema and improves a weak point of squash&merge with preliminary merge checks — our CI won’t simply allow you to merge a branch which may not pass tests or build when it is merged to development branch. 
Our CI agents are allocated dynamically now on Amazon servers. We measure coverage in sonarqube and lcov tool with reports loaded to Jenkins artifact server, build docs, bindings and release files, update docker containers. Developers are notified about build issues by email. 

After a month since today development branch is going to be protected, all PRs are going to be merged via Jenkins: jenkins.soramitsu.co.jp

Stateful validation error responses https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1486

*Middle*
Now users can create empty roles https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1510
WSV (blockchain state) in PostgreSQL stores permissions as bit strings https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1499
CLI values now are cached for convenience purposes https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1496 by *contributor* uditha-atukorala
Removed grantable permissions in queries https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1500
Refactored TransferAsset test https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1482
Databases are purged and dropped after tests https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1406

*Minor*
Fix indentation in code of error message in IP validator https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1514 https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1513
Fix type incompatibility on 32-bit platforms in keys manager https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1503

Finally, it is Friday 🎊🍾🎉🥂!

Week highlights 🔥:

We have improved our *throughput*⚡️ five times 😮 (according to Caliper measurements here https://bit.ly/2lZKPbJ)
It used to be pretty low in previous release (around 30tx/s), now it is 151tx/s on two local peers, and please don’t be confused with that number as we are gradually improving the performance (yet as soon as we release BFT ordering service throughput might degrade a bit), and don’t compare us yet to other systems — as finalisation in Iroha is different compared to other platforms; due to its trusted BFT consensus algorithm and overall pipeline. 

Hopefully, we will contribute more to performance WG in Hyperledger and come up with clear comparison criteria ❔ soon.

*Major*
All the stateful validation errors are printed 📋 in peer logs. Now it is a lot easier to check what went wrong with a rejected transaction https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1493

Also, stateful errors are printed to users of Iroha as well. Temporarily we print all the issues and potentially disclose sensitive data, but don’t worry — we are designing error codes to hide that. https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1508
  
Finally, we have deleted account_id from a previously confusing API in Add/Subtract commands https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1511

Transaction batch introduction. New API, a new format of transaction and genesis block https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1504 & https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1534 & https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1545

Oops 🤷🏻, our CI was too good for the capacity of Amazon, we had to revert it back until we figure out what can be used instead https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1533

*Middle*
SOCI dependency management with CMake intehttps://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1509
Block and proposal creation benchmarks https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1539
Proposal and block txs validation https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1506

Hi! I have some problems with installing and building IROHA on my PC. So, I`ll try to describe a situation. My OS is Ubuntu. I don't understand, where I need to build the IROHA project? Is it my system or docker container?  And what will I have in the result: library, project or some working container? I follow this instruction: http://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/build.html

2. Are there any frameworks/libraries for C++ development?
Thanks.

*[Nikolai Soramitsu](https://t.me/nikolay_sora)* _via telegram_
Greetings!
As for frameworks — can you specify a bit more?
There are several options in Hyperledger:
1) Iroha has C# library, generated via SWIG. We need help of contributors to create a project which will generate the library with a script, import gRPC and a sample code. This is a lot of fun :) and if you can contribute please follow the same approach here https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/tree/master/example (pick any language) and don't hesistate to ask questions.
I was trying to put the library in Xamarin project, but have experienced troubles with platform-dependancy... 
2) as I understand you can possibly contribute to sawtooth SDK and make a transaction processor pipeline in C#:
https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/tree/master/sdk

As for C++ — our codebase is completely in C++ and we have client library in it as well. Fabric has Node and Java only, check sawtooth list via the link above

Hi guys! I have a few questions about Hyperlegder system. I am a newbie with blockchain and Hyperledger партикулар, so do not judge strictly. There is the list of my purposes below.
1. I want to try to create a simple network with 3 nodes: admin and two clients, and two tunnels: admin-client1 and admin-client2 without the possibility for client1 to see client2 transactions and vise versa. Sure, admin can see all transactions.
2. For start, I want to use the Hyperledger Composer for the getting my goals.
3. I want to use Iroha to create the same.

Currently, I installed development environment following that instruction https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/unstable/installing/development-tools.html.
 My questions are:
1. What need I to do for the getting my goals?
2. What resources for the learning can you recommend to me following my goals?
3. I understand that the current community is for Iroha only, so, what community can you recommend to me?
I'll be grateful for any information.

Want to know what we’ve recently done? Here is our weekly update for W28 🔥:

*Major*
Binary Testing Framework. This is a test framework that helps testing client libraries (now particularly in Python) if they produce valid transactions and queries (if permissions and other business rules were met)  https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1485 https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1558 (fix)

“On-demand” ordering service implementation. In August, Ordering Service of Iroha is going to be Byzantine Fault-Tolerant, and this code introduces new behavior of peers — where they would ask each other for a proposal https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1484
#HelpWanted we need someone with skills of animating algorithms, especially in distributed systems. This would help us to explain Ordering Service component behavior to a broader audience 

As we have decided to improve existing interface a bit, our users are able to query account information in a flexible way (check description here https://soramitsu.atlassian.net/browse/IR-1199) https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1535/ https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1540

Pluggable storage with SOCI library. It also bundles a nice thread pool for faster interconnection with PostgreSQL https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1505

*Middle*
Retrieval of pending transactions from Iroha. When a transaction is sent and it requires more signatures — accounts can query Iroha peers in order to get such transactions https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1532 https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1548 https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1552 

Transaction status streaming was rewritten completely with RxCpp (if you don’t know what is this check https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxCpp)
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1541

Synchronization of expired blocks, which was a small yet annoying bug in process of peer synchronization https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1521

Validation of transaction batches. Soon we would have a ready-to-use solution for transaction batch processing, that would check if all involved parties have signed the batch https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1549

Fuzzing Iroha input. Now, libfuzz checks the input in a client module (called Torii). What is awesome is that our protobuf messages are mutated as well. Isn’t this an awesome thing? https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1531 

Blocks are not directly copied now in C++ (and a move is a bit faster) https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1542

Our proto schema files have been prettified finally https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1550

*Minor*
Mark builders in shared model https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1564
Check the size of signatures set https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1536
Concurrent fix for abstract cache https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1560
Increase precision lifetime in insertAsset https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1562
Java binding fix https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1569

P.S. Stay tuned for progress in https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1557 — these optimizations are expected to deliver a faster throughput

I'm afraid it is known bug in CLI. You can try to pass your asset id `coin#test` as 1st parameter.

Yes, you are right! When I type asset ID to 'Account Id' field and account ID to 'Asset Id' all is OK.  May I pull request to fix it?

OK. I found one more bug. In the process of creating an account, I input next fields values

Account Name: felix
Domain Id: cat
Public Key: ef1c3a5a

Where 'felix' is a random name, 'cat' is successfully created domain, 'ef1c3a5a' is a random string what looks like some key, after entering which I get the crash of iroha-cli. I suppose that my random key has invalid format/size/etc. it is OK but the programm should return validation error/warning but no crash down. Am I right?

From user's standpoint our CLI is awful: it is unmaintainable, untested, and we need to rewrite it. 
Our main focus now is on platform stability and error hanldling. We are close to start working on CLI tool, but we would appreciate any help, and it should not be that hard to make it since we've got client libraries in many languages.

Hi everyone. I cannot understand in what way I can connect from PC2 to my Iroha network created on PC1. 
I use the default example on both PCs. I have a few questions follow:
1. Need I create my own domain? 
2. Need I create 2 accounts for both PCs? 
3. What public key need I use for creating accounts? 
4. Need I copy-paste some files/data/configs between PCs handly or another way? 
5. With what account I need to start the iroha-cli (in the test case I use admin@test I understand it but what I need to do in case of my own domain/accounts)?
6. When I add some transaction iroha-cli propose me send formed command to peer. But I understand that network consist of many peers and my command performs for everyone in a network (domain?). Or does it mean that formation of transaction block will perform selected peer?
7. What did I miss?
I know that I know nothing currently and am sure that part of my questions is fool, sorry about this. 
Thanks for any info :).

you don't need to create new domain for every new peer
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 00:00:21 GMT):<br/>
*[Kitsu](https://t.me/kitsu)* _via telegram_
1. Most probably yes, since without it you cannot create any user, thus operate with the network
2. You need to create 2 peers, but the number of users depending on your use case (what kind of stuff you'd like to do). For testing two users usually enough (since they can transfer assets between each other)
3. We're using ed25519 with sha3. You may use `./iroha-cli --account_name <acc_name> --new_account` and that generate `<acc_name>.pub` `<acc_name>.priv` (public and private keys accordingly)
4. You need to copy-paste genesis block, because it must be same for the network operation. Also config files are required for operation, but they might be different

5. I'm not sure that I get your question. Usernames (in your example admin) and domains (e.g test) aren't hardcoded, you can specify them on your own (e.g in genesis block and via sending related commands)
6. Yes, network consist of many peers and they're synchronized among each other. Thus you don't have to send transaction to all of them. Moreover, the dupplicate transactions will be rejected. In the peer address you need to specify `ip:port` of the peer

The only bugfree software is the one, which contains no code. We're trying to achieve quality software via the help of numerous tools (tons of tests, CI, static analyzers, etc) and could say that it's pretty stable.

Hi everyone! I still cannot create a network of 2 PCs. I don`t understand what I do wrong.
I'll try to describe done steps. Please, say what is wrong.
I have two virtual machines with Ubuntu OS PC1 and PC2, PC1 has local IP 1.2.3.4 and PC2 - 4.3.2.1. (it can ping each other)

Steps for both PCs:
1. git clone -b develop https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha --depth=1.
2. sudo docker network create srcmake-iroha-network.
3. sudo docker volume create blockstore.
4. sudo docker run --name some-postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -p 5432:5432 --network=srcmake-iroha-network -d postgres:9.5
5. sudo docker run -it --name iroha -p 50051:50051 -v $(pwd)/iroha/example:/opt/iroha_data -v blockstore:/tmp/block_store --network=srcmake-iroha-network --entrypoint=/bin/bash hyperledger/iroha:x86_64-develop (warning: NO hyperledger/iroha:x86_64-develop-latest because docker cannot find this)
6. irohad --config config.docker --genesis_block genesis.block --keypair_name node0
   In other terminal:
7. sudo docker exec -it iroha /bin/bash

For PC1 only:
8. iroha-cli -account_name admin@test

For PC2 only:
8. iroha-cli -account_name test@test

For PC1 only:
9. Add Asset Quantity; (asset Id is coin#test - the example asset)
10. Add Peer to Iroha Network (full address: 4.3.2.1:10001 (here 4.3.2.1 is PC2 IP, 10001 - default port ), the public key is from file test@test.pub (is it right?)) - seems this step is wrong.
11. I try to add assets but get warning "OrderingServicePransportGrpc RPC failed: Connect Failed"
12. I try to Get Account`s Assets for admin@test but get error "QueryResponseHandler Query is stateless invalid". 

One more question is how to update iroha-cli? What component needs to be updated for this? I tried recreating docker network, volume and containers, cloned latest version of the branch but it was useless.
Thanks so much!

First you need to add peers addresses in genesis block 
Second thing is about port. 10001 - is for nodes sync (that one is written in genesis block and that one is used in AddPeer command), port for the Torii (aka client interface) is 50051 by default (set in config file)

Hi guys! I have so interesting question. A chain of transactions saves locally on a disk, right? I know the size of the single transaction and transaction amount. How can I calculate a global size of chain on my PC? I assume that for this calculation I should know the amount of transaction in one block and size of a block header. So, where can I find this info and how can I calculate it? I assume that formula of this calculation will be like " global_size = (global_transaction_amount 
 * single_transaction_size) + ((global_transaction_amount / transaction_amount_it_a_block) * block_header_size) " Thanks!

there is no term as "block header" similar to other blockchains. there is a block — it contains metadata, signatures and transactions directly (not hashes)

Hey guys.  I am researching blockchain solutions to use for a very simple internal accounting system.  Iroha has got my attention because of it's simplicity and ease of use.  I am curious to ask if someone could direct me in regards to what would be a general flow for my primary business scenario.  In the world of Ethereum I would call this "Token Minting".  What I am attempting to do with Iroha is to mint a Token and send it to a user account upon an external fiat/credit card transaction.  Basically pegging the revenue of the company and the liability that we have to the user.

It’s been a week since last weekly update. Here is a weekly update for W29 2018 🔥:

*Major changes*

Command executors, completely in SQL (which implies this is going to be faster and more error-prone) https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1557
Query execution can be mocked now (and tests are going to be much cleaner and easy to read) https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1579
Transaction batch was added to API set. Now many accounts can sign single batch in order to confirm its validity https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1565
New API in shared model. Now client libraries can calculate hashes, check the validity of messages and sign them with private keys https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1543 
The amount now is passed as a string (I hope you don’t know what there was before 😅) https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1555

*Middle changes*

Transaction list is now retrieved by Iroha peer (almost a batch — small changes remain for its full implementation) https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1568
Common objects factory https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1556
Support of transaction batch in ordering gate https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1582
Support of transaction batch in Peer Communication Service and Transaction https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1571
Builders are replaced with mocked Shared Model interfaces https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1563
WSV Query factories (instead of builders) https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1573
Refactor QueryProcessor interface https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1572

*Minor changes*

Jenkins build status badge link https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1551
Shared Model build status is fixed https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1576
Removed exception in batch Stateful Validation https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1574
A proposal is not copied anymore https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1567
Java binding fix https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1569

I am not sure... How can I configure the port for RPC? I use config.docker file from the example where configured: "torii_port" : 50051 and "internal_port" : 10001. Also, there is the port for Postgres. And no more ports I saw.

50051 is the one for client Iroha rpc
10001 is the one for inter-nodes communication

So if you have OrderingGate issue, that basically means that ordering components (aka Iroha nodes) cannot connect to each other. So look for the second one (e.g try with netcat/curl/whatever locally and remotely)

As I know verbosity of our log is pretty flat, the vast majority of messages are printed with INFO tag.
By default Iroha peer prints its log to standard output (console).

Are you experiencing troubles with something we can help?

This will take an eternity though :) So please use more memory for now.
We've got optimizations team in Iroha which is in charge of issues with build time and transaction throughput, and so far the plan is to minimize use of templates, as I understand. 

Also, if you have ccache installed Iroha won't take a lot of time to rebuild (like maybe x10 times faster). Usually first build is time-consuming because it download all missing external dependencies Himanshu

If you are planning to use Iroha: develop you can always try installing iroha-lib@develop from npm. It also contains example in "example" folder. Also, I would recommend trying https://github.com/soramitsu/iroha-wallet-js - to be honest we support it more than example in Iroha repo.

Generate unique keypair for each peer, supply the same Genesis block for all peers, and run peers.

Genesis block in this case must contain addresses of all peers.

Or, you can supply one peer in Genesis block and then, add other peers in runtime with command AddPeer

@bv_o0 I read on the docs about Block: "Signed with crypto signatures of Iroha peers, voting for this block during consensus". So when a peer want to create a new block, it will broadcast a vote for a valid block between all peer. Am i right?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Wed, 01 Aug 2018 04:23:49 GMT):<br/>

This is a part of consensus. Basic idea is voting, yes. To apply new block supermajority of peers (2/3*n +1) should vote (add their signatures) for given block

Hi y'all.  I'm a senior dev, and our org is currently reviewing the Hyperledger projects to see if one if them would work for our needs.  Both Sawtooth and Iroha seem to have the right stuff, but a couple questions...  I'm happy to take our questions and inquiry to a specific lead if someone here suggests that.

(1) I want to confirm that since Sawtooth and Iroha both use BFT/hashgraph-style consensus, network partitioning can be halty.   Do either of these systems have design provisions that support temporary network partitions?  For instance, suppose the system is used to track inventory for multiple restaurant branches plus their food truck.  It would be ideal for the food truck to have access to past txns and chain data, even when it has no network access in the field.  You'd want that food trucks to be able to commit txns that reflect, say, use of hot dogs and an increase in cash.  At the end of the week the food truck comes back from being incommunicado, connects to a network, and those committed txns replicate to the rest of the chain.  As I understand it, BFT would initiate a service halt on the food truck's system once it disconnected from the network long enough as the truck initially departed (in contrast to a system that would recognize that its local chain is trumped by the main chain and proceed to walk its own chain back and recommit the day's txns into the "better" chain)

(2) We will have *some* bulk data stored on-chain.  To continue our example, each restaurant and food truck is required by the owner to commit to the chain a photo of any plate of food returned to the kitchen from a customer (~100k each).  Do one or both of these systems have provisions for bulk data transfers (so that binary data *isn't* sent though textual serialization, such as JSON).  That is, are these systems provisioned for a client to request, say, megs of txn attachment data at at time?  We want to make sure that in the system we use, bulk binary data handling is first-class.

You'd want that food truck to be able to commit txns that reflect, say, use of hot dogs and an increase in cash -- in the field with NO network access.  At the end of the week the food truck comes back from being incommunicado, connects to a network, and those committed txns replicate to the rest of the chain.  As I understand it, BFT would initiate a service halt on the food truck's system once it disconnected from the network long enough as the truck initially departed (in contrast to a system that would recognize that its local chain is trumped by the main chain and proceed to walk its own chain back and recommit the day's txns into the "better" chain)

(2) We will have *some* bulk data stored on-chain.  To continue our example, each restaurant and food truck is required by the owner to commit to the chain a photo of any plate of food returned to the kitchen from a customer (~100k each).  Do one or both of these systems have provisions for bulk data transfers (so that binary data *isn't* sent though textual serialization, such as JSON).  That is, are these systems provisioned for a client to request, say, megs of txn attachment data at at time?  We want to make sure that in the system we use, bulk binary data handling is first-class.

Hi y'all.  I'm a senior dev, and our org is currently reviewing the Hyperledger projects to see if one if them would work for our needs.  Both Sawtooth and Iroha seem to have the right stuff, but a couple questions...  I'm happy to take our questions and inquiry to a specific lead if someone here suggests that.

(1) I want to confirm that since Sawtooth and Iroha both use BFT/hashgraph-style consensus, network partitioning can be halty.   Do either of these systems have design provisions that support temporary network partitions?  For instance, suppose the system is used to track inventory for multiple restaurant branches plus their food truck.  It would be ideal for the food truck to have access to past txns and chain data, even when it has no network access in the field.  You'd want that food truck to be able to commit txns that reflect, say, use of hot dogs and an increase in cash -- in the field with NO network access.

1 - blocks can be applied in any network with supermajority. So if your partitions are 7 and 3 peers, 7 peers will commit changes and 3 will not. When 3 peers connect to other 7, they will download newest blocks and will be synced up with supermajority
</p>
<p><strong>BZ55</strong> (Wed, 01 Aug 2018 06:20:42 GMT):<br/>
What happens to the txns in blocks that were committed to the smaller partition (e.g. the food truck commits that X hod dogs were consumed on Monday)?  They get kicked back as failed when the smaller partition reconnects?  Or are they rejected once the smaller partition recognizes (or halts) b/c it can't reach enough peers.

Is that something that's built-in as an option or would an operator have to "manually" see that their node is effectively in a halt state.

Totally get that -- was asking if there are any features that would essentially allow txn to be committed but in a deferred/queued state (a) waiting for the state to unhalt and (b) be locally accessible as if they were committed -- true to the nature of tracking inventory, in this case.

hashes.add(Hash.fromHexString(hashHexString))`

2 - blockchain makes storage very inefficient, as for N peers the same piece of data is stored N times (replication factor is N)

More efficient way to store data on blockchain is to store cryptographic commitments on the blockchain and send data off chain. 
One commitment scheme is hashing. So you just store small hash of the plate photo on the blockchain, then store photo itself on the file server

And kindly consider that, in the private+LAN federation system, there are many use cases where it's high effective to us the chain for binary storage...as long as the chain infrastructure doesn't make the process painful (such as having to transmit all queries and responses through JSON).  It's import for a framework to offer some form of compact binary representation.  Using blockchains for small private federations is more of thing.  Sure, we're not talking storage on the order of gigs per transaction, but megs are reasonable.  

In one of our experimental implementations, we use a private distro of Ethereum where we piggyback 32k blocks in txns.  Our permission layer + UI is responsible for breaking up a file into pieces and reassembling them.  So as we show around for more fitting layer one chains, it's important that binary data isn't being marshaled with O(1) overhead.

Please, change line 48 of `index.js` to `var txblob = new iroha.ModelProtoTransaction(tx).signAndAddSignature(keys).finish().blob()`
And well, you don't need `var protoTxHelper = new iroha.ModelProtoTransaction()`

We've changed interface of shared model a little, but I think we forgot to update our example. We are working at the new JS library, hope we will show it soon 🙂

You can use iroha-cli like this:
```
`
iroha-cli --genesis_block --peers_address peers.list
`
`
whereas `peers.list` should be formed as following`

`
192.168.0.1:50051
192.168.0.2:50051

```

I have got a problem with iroha. Everytime I try to add assets to my account id , it displays the following error Transaction has not passed stateless validation. 0 AddAssetQuantity: [[Wrongly formed asset_id, passed value: 'admin@test'. Field should match regex '[a-z_0-9]{1,32}\#([a-zA-Z]([a-zA-Z0-9\-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?\.)*[a-zA-Z]([a-zA-Z0-9\-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?' Amount must be greater than 0, passed value: 0 ]]. Now although it shows wrongly formed asset id with passed value admin@test, i actually passed coolcoin#test as asset id. I don't understand why this same error is shown again and again

And one more question: what does "quorum" field mean? I cannot understand for what is this one. For transaction validation must be signatures from all peers with can_add_signatory rights, right? Does "quorum" field mean a number of signatories to confirm user-initiator and isn't it related with a number of signatories to confirm a transaction?

By default all accounts on iroha are multisig accounts. In n-m multisig account n is quorum, m is total number of registered signatories. 

This works only for accounts and not for peers

My question is `199.247.26.56` is a IP of deployed iroha network ? But when I changed it into IP of my personal computer which has running iroha, I got an `CommandService Stateless invalid` warning.

Yes, you can follow this guide. But you need to tune parameters in Iroha config file as defaults are OK for development but not for a production-running system. Particularly, parameters of interest are `max_proposal_size` and `proposal_delay`. Value of 1000 for both should be enough to start with.
We also have files for Kubernetes cluster deployment. We expect these configs to be published very soon.

Thanks for your reply. But I have the same question as Tran B.  :
`resValue "string", "iroha_url", "199.247.26.56"`
 This is a config from iroha-android sample (https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-android). My question is `199.247.26.56` is a IP of deployed iroha network ? But when I changed it into IP of my personal computer which has running iroha, I got an `CommandService Stateless invalid` warning.

On the original IP : `199.247.26.56` the sample application work, but on my own deploy, it said that: ``Wrongly formed creator_account_id, passed value: ''``

Hi, I'm doing research on the different permissioned blockchains. There is any information about transaction throughput and latency (time to confirm a transaction) with regards to Iroha? 
Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 09 Aug 2018 12:59:58 GMT):<br/>
*[Artyom Bakhtin](https://t.me/a_bakhtin)* _via telegram_
We're currently working hard on improving performance of the system. We expect to reach several hundred transactions per second rate by the first stable release in November. The latency really depends on the stability of the networking environment you're deploying Iroha in. In a lab environment we observed under a second transactions latency.

Also "tps" is pretty meaningless regarding to permissioned blockchain, since there are a lot of parameters that is influenced by and there's a limit of operations depending on the case

Hello everyone! 🖖🏽

 It's time for our #IrohaWeekly! 
So, without further ado, this week we:
- got rid of load delay after introducing consensus cache : https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1631

- implemented signed/unsigned transactions collection validators and more: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1614

- replaced inheritance with composition for AsyncGrpcClient: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1612

- got rid of any hopes of bindings (sometimes it's for the best, you know) in case any internal commands of bash script fail: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1477

- gave the transaction processor the ability to handle transaction sequences. All for the sake of neat code and correct logic!  https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1577

That's all for today. Hope you're all having a great weekend! 🎉

Take a look at this script that generates Java classes here https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/master/example/java/prepare.sh
Pay attention to line #4. It generates Java classes with -DSWIG_JAVA=ON parameter, and we have similar parameter for C# which is SWIG_CSHARP. In this case CMake execute routine listed here https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/38dd0a1818e0269834625985955a360d34cb8baf/shared_model/bindings/CMakeLists.txt#L101

To be honest I tried this before with Xamarin and had no time to play around. If you can contribute to the project with C# library generated from SWIG this can help us reach even broader set of libraries. Please check respective Java and Python folders, this may help you. Also don't be frustrated if there are some issues, as SWIG is really not very user-friendly and might require tuning interface file (https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/master/shared_model/bindings/bindings.i)

For multisig, the idea is that you add a set of accounts that have the rights to sign off on a transaction. Then the quorum is the number of those accounts that must sign off to finalize a transaction

Gulshan kumar Krish, [14. Aug 2018 at 14:33:09]:
Can any one tell me the difference between Soramitsu -- Hyperledger Iroha and Hyperledger Indy.

As far as i know both are digital management?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 13:18:30 GMT):<br/>
*[Sara](https://t.me/liralemur)* _via telegram_
Well, as I see it, Indy is more specific about tools for decentralised identity and Iroha is a framework that can be used in a more general way. 
They are generally described in Hyperledger's White paper here: https://www.hyperledger.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/HL_Whitepaper_IntroductiontoHyperledger.pdf

It gave me a lot of understanding

Yahh, that's true but this is rather indirect generation which is used by ed25519. A seed is created by private key and then this is use to create the public key.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 17:51:20 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 17:54:04 GMT):<br/>
*[B V](https://t.me/bv_o0)* _via telegram_
okay, I can explain.

ed25519 originally has 32 byte *random* private key, so you can have private key 00...00 (32 bytes)
public key is derived from private key deterministically (if you know C, you can explore this https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-ed25519/blob/master/lib/ed25519/ref10/ed25519.c#L14-L25)

Originally ed25519 was developed with SHA2-512 usage 
(https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-ed25519/blob/master/lib/ed25519/ref10/ed25519.c#L18)

in Soramitsu, we changed SHA2 to SHA3 implementation, so Iroha uses ed25519-sha3 implementation
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 17:56:43 GMT):<br/>
*[B V](https://t.me/bv_o0)* _via telegram_
however, some implementations use the term *seed* for the private key:

https://github.com/Warchant/ed25519-sha3-java/blob/master/src/main/java/jp/co/soramitsu/crypto/ed25519/spec/EdDSAPrivateKeySpec.java#L25:14
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 18:00:57 GMT):<br/>
*[B V](https://t.me/bv_o0)* _via telegram_
referring to your original question — in Iroha we use random bytestrings of length 32 as private keys
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 18:04:07 GMT):<br/>
*[Newbie](https://t.me/auxRegal)* _via telegram_

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 18:04:50 GMT):<br/>

more correct term is "derivation". you derive public key from private key, not just generate

Hi everyone. I need some help adding new node to existing network. I have a network with two nodes - both added in genesis block. Let us assume those are both docker containers on the same host machine. I would like to add new node. I try to do so, by:
1. Generating new keypair (using iroha-cli --account_name newNode --new_account)
2. Adding a transaction that adds the peer to the network (again, using iroha-cli I am adding a new peer with an IP:PORT and key found in newNode.pub generated above)
3. This one I am not entirely sure about. I am running the new peer with THE SAME genesis block that the other peers used  (irohad --config config.newNode --genesis_block genesis.block --keypair_name newNode). The node starts up fine.
The question is how to force newNode to synchronize with other nodes?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 13:33:56 GMT):<br/>

node will be syncronized right after the next transaction
</p>
<p><strong>BgwBgw</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 13:35:05 GMT):<br/>
That would be great, BUT! Next transaction is never commitet. It always stops at valid stateless validation. Consensus is never made 
</p>
<p><strong>BgwBgw</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 13:36:41 GMT):<br/>
On some occasions next transaction causes nodes to crash due to segmentation fault, on others I just see gRPC connect failure. I am sure correct ports are set-up, and that nodes see each other

It depends on the number of nodes. To add a new node you first need at least 4 nodes running

In what format is peerKey stored in genesis.block?

<p><strong>BgwBgw</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 13:51:18 GMT):<br/>

How to use iroha-cli -new_account ?
</p>
<p><strong>BgwBgw</strong> (Tue, 21 Aug 2018 06:45:48 GMT):<br/>
to generate new_account_name.pub and new_account_name.priv use:
iroha-cli --account_name new_account_name --new_account

I'm deploying multiple instance to Azure, I created 2 VMs and setup Iroha already. When I'm using `iroha-cli` to create a tx, one peer trying to connect to another peer through port 10001 but it said that:

`
[2018-08-21 07:18:19.182168002][th:14][warning] OrderingGate RPC failed: Connect Failed`


Do I have to run something to make another peer listen on that port? Notice that I opened port 50051 and 10001 already

I see that port 10001 on my deployed Iroha is not listening

Here is log on another:

Here is log on iroha-cli:

The iroha-cli said that tx on peer which tx sent to has passed stateless validation, but on another peer it said that tx not found

<p><strong>BgwBgw</strong> (Tue, 21 Aug 2018 10:07:23 GMT):<br/>
After playing around with several local latest docker containers (hyperledger/iroha:develop) I've encountered several issues.
On one side I admire and appreciate all your efforts, and would love to see Iroha become popular and take over the market, but on the other side it seems like there are still problems with basic funcionalities.

1. 'Segmentation fault' on one or more peers while making consensus. Restarting daemon doesn't bring network back to work.
2. 'Transaction has successfully passed stateless validation' on single peer, while 'Transaction was not found in the system' on the others. Occurs after '[th:84][warning] AsyncGrpcClient RPC failed: GOAWAY received' or '[th:84][warning] AsyncGrpcClient RPC failed: Socket closed'.
3. After single node failure, other peers only log 'AsyncGrpcClient receive proposal', 'AsyncGrpcClient transactions in proposal: 1' and 'OrderingGate Received new proposal, height: xx'. Network is no longer functional.
4. Endless loop in new node after adding first transaction after defining new node (transaction that should cause new node sync). Loop logging:
ChainValidator validate chain...
ChainValidator Validating block: height 2, hash a77c2a0689972aa3c3865e9c71968f6e45cfdc2e01a43827be9274d189d95664
ChainValidator validate block: height 2, hash a77c2a0689972aa3c3865e9c71968f6e45cfdc2e01a43827be9274d189d95664
ChainValidator Validating block: height 3, hash e3bfdfae3313b6c66f8d716a3f6c2a763384c6d32014142c0e03330c6d2531d2
ChainValidator validate block: height 3, hash e3bfdfae3313b6c66f8d716a3f6c2a763384c6d32014142c0e03330c6d2531d2

To sum up, nodes seem to easily loose connection with each other, and never connect back, they seem unstable and vulnerable.

Please tell me - are those only my problems? Should I seek problems in the way I do things? Is it a case of develop branch being unstable? If so, can you point a stable branch/tag instead? What are your plans? What's on your roadmap? Will Iroha get less egg-shelly and more diamond-hard?

I'm having No 2
Also on master branch, transaction take a bit long to send to server (about 2 3 secs delay), as compare with develop branch. Although android client and Iroha the same computer.

#IrohaWeekly is here! 🎉 Better (just a bit) later than never, right? 

We worked hard this week - all of us. 
Because it's thanks to you guys we discover what we need to do and what is important - we appreciate it a lot. 

So, this week we:
- improved documentation compiler: in https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1641 and https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1644

- fixed Torii tests so now they are acting more 'human' and also help testing diverse enviroments: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1646

- introduced features of permission check right in SQL executors: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1605 and get_roles_test: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1636

- made the last block load faster with consensus cache in Block Loader and YaC Gate: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1627

- fixed overwrite-ledger option: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1640

- added tests for revoke_permission: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1637 and fixed one: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1657

- before it was impossible to add a role without permissions to account. Now it is possible: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1654

- added factory for a block: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1622

- implemented YaC proposal gate: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1623

- worked on on-demand OS transport: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1635 and on-demand connection manager: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1645

- fixed database connections so they are not occupied permanently with components anymore: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1629

- added run-postgres-dev and stop-postgres-dev scripts: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1633

- allowed empty blocks processing: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1621

- added tests for CreateAsset command:

We are working on implementation of decentralized solution, which is not incorporated into Iroha core. In fact, we use client libraries in order to change Iroha ledger and its rich API is very helpful. Later the code should be published on GitHub

Hello! 
I am following the documentation guide of Iroha to implement  it for multiple peer example, just to play with it. So it says that we should have a host machine and multiple VMs. Do I need to build iroha on the VMs as well in order to connect the host to those?  As I've read that we add the peer IPs during initial configuration (gensis block), so what if we want to add more peers as we go along? e.g. we have an services provider app and as more users are registered on the app, I would like to add those as peers. Bit confused on this point.

Thanks in anticipation.

Yasir, hi. In order to attach a peer to an existing network you should do the following:
1) peer that should be added has to generate keypair. Also, it should have a genesis block that the rest of the network already has.
2)Iroha account with rights to add peer should send transaction with AddPeer command that contains:
- public key of added peer
- network address of the peer (with an internal port, which is by default is 10001. E.g. it would be like 192.168.x.x:10001)
3) Launch Irohad on this peer with genesis block and network address exposed to the network. Also, network addresses of other peers should be reachable from this peer. 

Upon completion of this steps — peer will synchronize with the network.

I understand. One follow up question though: Since the peer will be added by a different account, how can a new peer generate its own keypair without logging into iroha? As I remember, you have to have an account in order to login to iroha cli.

Hi guys, I'm trying to deploy Iroha old version.

Thanks for your response. No need to sorry, I'm appreciate your effort. I wish I could help you guys but C++ is so advance to me.

Anyway I just want to check that whether just me getting this bug. 

Up to now I'm getting some bug on android sdk with Iroha server. Been trying:
- I ran iroha-android repo (bindings from iroha-android-bindings, built from source), I only changed IP to my Iroha server, I didn't touch anything in code but Iroha said that transaction invalid. But using the original IP "199.247.26.56", the app work normally.

- Me and my friend created a simple project to test transaction with my Iroha server but Iroha said that transaction invalid.
https://github.com/truongnmt/iroha-glowing-octo-carnival
https://github.com/TranBaVinhSon/hello_iroha_android/ 

Weird that in both ways, Iroha said the same error:
CommandService Stateless invalid tx ... Transaction should contain at least one command Wrongly formed creator_account_id, passed value: '' ...

I carefully reported in issue #1655.

Would you be so kind as to have a look? I'm really appriciate. Thanks a lot!

*[Nikolai Soramitsu](https://t.me/nikolay_sora)* _via telegram_
yes. However as for "working" I am sorry to say that we identified two defects that we are currently fixing, which are: 
1) Update of pending storage in Iroha MST does not work. Which means that unfortunately you cannot get now multisignature transactions (or transaction batches) from Iroha cache and sign them in order to send them back, ready for processing.
2) If you send an invalid Iroha transaction — it will break transaction processing due to our design issue, as we wanted to get rid of empty blocks in chain. Unfortunately it was an invalid decision, since it exposes replay attack possibilities and breaks transaction processing.
3) MST state propagation. We want all our peers to exchange MST cache data with half-baked transactions (which don't yet have enough signatures and are waiting for more). This is not working unfortunately.

We've made a decision on Monday to freeze feature development and focus on all quality defects now. We appreciate any kind of contribution that can come from your side. In order to make this process more effective and hassle-free we are going to separate this chat into several, with at least a general chat like this one and another for defect status tracking and bug reports. Please stay tuned!

Okay. There is only ansible playbook example to start that? Or there are other options too? Image I have 4 VMs and one host machine and all 4 VMs should have same verison of Iroha (dev in my case) and the same genesis block (with all 4 IPs listed into the genesis block).... This is what I gathered from the getting started guide. Correct me if I'm wrong.

There is a PR opened (https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1697) for deploying arbitrary number of Iroha nodes on Kubernetes cluster. This could be another option. You should have the same genesis block with peers listed in it. You need to generate a keypair for each node as well. That is an automated process both in ansible playbook and in PR.

Hello everyone! 🖖🏽
We are very proud to introduce our work this week — it included some very important changes. 
We: 

1. Fixed:
- container timestamp validation: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1695
- BFT OS algorithm and interfaces: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1670
- on-demand ordering gate: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1675
- send tx sequence method: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1685
- log order: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1686

We also introduced 1 hotfix this week making dev branch equivalent to develop: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1693

2. Worked on tests:
- moved common object builders and proposal and block builders for testing: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1688 and https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1699

First, thanks for your team's efforts and your support. I'm really appriciate! 🙇
What I’m trying to do is to implement Iroha into Android and iOS with my deployed Iroha server.

1. On android, I’m having issue:  CommandService Stateless invalid tx - Wrongly formed creator_account_id, passed value: '' 
I have written detail in issue #1655 

2. On deploy Iroha on 2 hosts, hosts can connect each other but transaction failed to create:
TxProcessor Stateful validation error: transaction ... did not pass initial verification: checking 'signatures are a subset of signatories', error message 'stateful validator error: signatures in transaction are not account signatories

3. I’m concern about iOS SDK as well.

hello guys, I've read YAC paper and can't really get how ordering service works. Did I get it right that every node has OS embedded into it? So to which node client is connected that node will order client transactions? But what happen's then with other clients txs?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 10:57:49 GMT):<br/>
*[Nikolai Soramitsu](https://t.me/nikolay_sora)* _via telegram_
Hi Mikhail! Happy to hear that you read our paper and got interest to our project. At the moment paper does not have any information about BFT ordering service, which is at the moment is going to be integrated into next release (hopefully). 
Ordering Service in YAC paper is just a single peer that collects all the transactions and forms a proposal, which is exactly what we did before BFT Ordering Service. As soon as we release next beta version with BFT OS in it we will update the paper.

Your concern about transaction is not going to be that strong since our new Ordering Service component is distributed among peers, which share transactions inside the network, so when connected peer is going to be down your transactions remain in the network
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 11:02:50 GMT):<br/>
*[Mikhail](https://t.me/dicktophone)* _via telegram_
so YAC will consist of two distributed networks both managed by BFT for achieving consensus (os and voting  peers)?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 12:22:33 GMT):<br/>
*[Mikhail](https://t.me/dicktophone)* _via telegram_
and two more questions about implementation:
1) can we somehow create custom validation rules in Iroha? like, we need to limit the ability to make new txs only to verified users, so can we create a validator that checks for presence for custom fields in user details?
2) also we want to make sure that all txs from users are co-signed by some endorsement (taxing) peer. Its also about custom validation rules I think, but is it even possible right now?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 12:24:41 GMT):<br/>
*[Nikolai Soramitsu](https://t.me/nikolay_sora)* _via telegram_
Iroha daemons are monolithic applications that form homogenous network, ordering service consensus and state consensus happen at the same peers
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 12:25:59 GMT):<br/>
*[Mikhail](https://t.me/dicktophone)* _via telegram_
great, so every node acts like and ordering service and state node at the same time?

> 1) can we somehow create custom validation rules in Iroha? 

Not now, but stay tuned. In next version in Iroha we will allow customization with SQL.


> 2) also we want to make sure that all txs from users are co-signed by some endorsement (taxing) peer

Use an external application that would use Iroha client library and sign up transactions, coming from multisignature accounts. Don't send them directly to Iroha network, instead send them to endorsement peers that will attach their signature to transactions so that it will become valid

*[Igor Egorov](https://t.me/igor_egorov)* _via telegram_
Hi. The geneisis block is not valid. The correct naming for the fields on lines 92 and 99 is “mainPubkey” not “mainPubKey” (relevant for the master branch). If you will try to pass “mainPubKey” then Iroha would not be able to parse genesis block.

The filed naming was slightly changed in dev and develop branches - now there “publicKey” is used instead of “mainPubkey”.

If we use only 5-6 VMs by deploying Iroha onto them and just creating users on Iroha Daemon with some domain, would it still work under YAC:BFT? Means only 6 peers and multiple users on them for transactions? 

Will they (all users) have to consolidate the transactions and send them in one Proposal? (for each peer)

Hi. If the problem with keys (Iroha on 2 hosts, stateful validation failed…) occurs using this genesis block then the genesis block should be changed. It should contain addPeer commands for both peers.

*[Igor Egorov](https://t.me/igor_egorov)* _via telegram_
The new genesis block and related keypairs for nodes and admin account can be generated via iroha-cli:
`
iroha-cli --genesis_block --peers_address peers.list`

And peers.list must be like:
192.168.1.1:10001
192.168.1.2:10001

About iroha-cli and AddAssetQuantity command - that is an issue - iroha-cli currently unable to build a valid transaction with AddAssetQuantity command. Thanks for pointing! While iroha-cli is broken you can issue the same transaction using our client librares, e.g. python library. For details, please explore example/python/tx-example.py

@stronglong, The issue was addressed in this pr https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1713 
Untill the docker image will be updated, you can built your own iroha-cli without AddAssetQuantity bug using the branch from the pr and hyperledger/iroha:develop-build docker image

Yes, it's possible, though iroha lacks proper security granularity for that point now
E.g if you'd like to make an exchange (with dynamic rates), internals must be changed. Otherwise anyone with transferring permissions can exchange assets

sure, you can use iroha-cli on a host machine. iroha-cli binary is available after Iroha complilation. If you don't want to compile Iroha, you can get the binary from hyperledge/iroha:develop Docker image. Just copy it on a host machine so its available in PATH environment variable (/usr/local/bin should work)

you can get iroha-cli from hyperledger/iroha:develop Docker image. Then you run `docker create hyperledger/iroha:develop` to create a throwaway container. Then `docker cp <imageid>:<path to iroha-cli> <host path to copy to>`

Dear community, 

Sorry for that flaw in Ansible playbook. We will fix it day-to-day. There are 2 changes you should do manually until we fix this:

1) rename config.sample to config.docker
2) add `
"mst_enable":  false`
 to the `
deploy/ansible/roles/iroha-standalone-deploy-node/templates/config.j2`
 file
</p>

This works since you're deploying nodes on the same host. Even if Docker network with same name is created on another host, containers won't be able to ping each other by its private IPs. In order to enable communication by private IPs (or even by DNS names) overlay network must be created. But that is not the case for deploying Iroha using Ansbile

In my app, there is a *Realtime* *chartboard* to show list of user and ranking them to see who has the most money (asset). What is the best approach? Is that simple as spaming querry all user asset amount every 5 seconds?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 04:30:57 GMT):<br/>
*[Kitsu](https://t.me/kitsu)* _via telegram_
This kind of systems is do have numerous parameters and that enough to determine the Iroha performance consider your example.
Besides the number you mentioned it depends, but not limited to:
1. Avg. transaction size (and it type distribution actually, some of them harder to perform)
2. Frequency of tx
3. Frequency of queries

If you are considering 1tx/sec per user (implying 3k tps) it is not possible for now with any tx size, as far as I know. Though I hope we will reach this number soon.
It should work pretty well, if the user has 1tx/min per user (implying 50 tps), and at that case it will probably have some limit gap (again depending on the transaction complexity).
If you'd like to test the system on the different cases and check whether your requirement conform or not the system parameters you may try out Caliper: https://github.com/hyperledger/caliper

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 04:32:15 GMT):<br/>

I would also mention the physical system characteristic as a major parameter (I/O, network throughput, CPU performance, DMA handling, virtual distance between hosts, etc)

Those are both frameworks indeed, but they are different in the way things are done - for example, Iroha is on C++ and has a role-based model of permissions. There are differences in means. 
It's just what fits your particular needs better I think 😌

[Q&A] On working on Iroha for a while, I have there following question I would like to discuss:
1. How node approve vote? Does all nodes approve the same way?
2. Since all nodes approve the same mechanism (I assume), on which case did the concensus does not meet? When does the approval < 2/3? 
3. Is there any attacker?
4. Does Iroha has whitepaper?
Thanks in advance!

Which version is the latest? develop-build? or develop? (Docker image)

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 15:22:08 GMT):<br/>
*[Vyacheslav Bikbaev](https://t.me/la_sintez)* _via telegram_
You can use `develop`

I was building iroha using `run-iroha-dev.sh` I guess this looks for only develop-build image. Is that updated as well? Or should I go explicitly for `develop` ?

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 15:51:34 GMT):<br/>
*[Artyom Bakhtin](https://t.me/a_bakhtin)* _via telegram_
`run-iroha-dev.sh` runs Docker container containing all dependencies for building Iroha. This runs develop-build Docker image tag. develop Docker image tag, on contrary, contains only release version of Iroha binaries and its dependencies. It is synced with develop branch of the Github repo.

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 15:58:24 GMT):<br/>

None. One container lets you build Iroha, second has it pre-built, so you can run it. I guess it should not affect performance, only size of the image.

Please, change line 48 of `index.js` to `var txblob = new iroha.ModelProtoTransaction(tx).signAndAddSignature(keys).finish().blob()`
And well, you don't need `var protoTxHelper = new iroha.ModelProtoTransaction()`

You can use 
ModelCrypto-s `generateKeypair()`

Also, you can generate private key as a 64-symbol hex string, and derive public key from it using `fromPrivateKey(privatekey)` method.

Theoretically, yes. If you're able to compile a binary for target CPU architecture it should be possible to run Iroha on Android. Iroha requires several shared libraries to be installed on the system as well. As we do not officially support Android platform, you may start tinkering with using 'Building Iroha' guide: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/build.html

addAssetQuantity adds assets only to transaction creator's account, so it doesn't have account_id at all.

One more thing: keys are generated in HEX format (e.g. `a1e1b1...`), but in genesis block they should be in Base64 `0E2i...=`). You can find something like "hex to base64" in the internet or convert it with your favourite programming language 🙂

After I change the creator keypair, transaction pass stateless validation but it doesn't do anything more. So here is my flow:

- generate new user: `iroha-cli --account_name admin@school --new_account`
- get admin@school's public key and chage to base64
- update the genesis.block, domain test -> school, admin@test -> admin@school
- run `irohad --config config.docker --genesis_block genesis.block --keypair_name node0 --overwrite_ledger`
- when I run `iroha-cli --account_name admin@school` transaction only pass stateless validation and no more. Weird things that is when I use the old admin@test transaction is commited :think

Quick question. When I build Iroha with the `run-iroha-dev.sh`, does it exposes port 10001 as well? As I am deploying them on remote servers so need both ports exposed to internet

Hi Yasir  No, it doesn’t. In oder to expose the port 10001 you have to modify run-iroha-dev.sh alongside with docker-compose.yml

Hello everyone! I have built my first Iroha network with the Test example in the Getting Started Guide. Is there a file, where all entry logs of various transactions are displayed or are they only in the terminal?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 21 Sep 2018 19:01:52 GMT):<br/>
*[Vyacheslav Bikbaev](https://t.me/la_sintez)* _via telegram_
Fabi they are in the terminal (well, you can pipe them to a file). Maybe I am wrong and they are stored somewhere else, @a_bakhtin back me up on this.

 Also, you can check the block storage where are the transactions are actualy stored. If I recall correctly, you can attach to a docker container (as it is explained in getting started) and cd to `/tmp/block_store` folder and look at those files, they are actualy blocks which store all successful transactions.

Hey! With @la_sintez command you are SSHing into the container, running nautilus on a "remote" machine is conceptually wrong; if you are trying to find a folder or a file I'd suggest something like `find * | grep <name>`

We are fixing some issues, for example testing properly MST (it is a very cool and important feature, seriously).

It is a tough question, honestly. We've changed some proto files to increase consistency. I think (and hope) that we won't change them anymore (and it won't change blocks), if you will be using the latest `dev` branch.

Can you also please explain in simple words that how MST is different from regular consensus of normal txs
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 22 Sep 2018 18:27:37 GMT):<br/>
*[Vyacheslav Bikbaev](https://t.me/la_sintez)* _via telegram_
MST is a transaction with more than 1 signature.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 22 Sep 2018 18:28:28 GMT):<br/>
*[Vyacheslav Bikbaev](https://t.me/la_sintez)* _via telegram_
So, you can have 10 keys in your account, set `quorum` of your account to 10 and transaction will be processed only if you sign it with all 10 keys.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 22 Sep 2018 18:29:36 GMT):<br/>
*[Vyacheslav Bikbaev](https://t.me/la_sintez)* _via telegram_
Moreover, you can send a transaction with only 1 key, for example - it will be in `pending` status in Iroha, then you can retrieve it, sign with other keys and send again
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 22 Sep 2018 18:30:57 GMT):<br/>
*Yasir* _via telegram_
Okay cool. So if we want it to be signed by one specific node every time, we can use mst by using pub key of that specific node? Right?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 22 Sep 2018 18:36:36 GMT):<br/>
*[Vyacheslav Bikbaev](https://t.me/la_sintez)* _via telegram_
Sorry, I don't understand your question 🙁 Nodes don't sign anything. Only clients (e.g. users, which have account) can sign and send transactions. Consensus isn't affected by MST: if transaction has not enough signatures, it is in pending state and waits to have all signatures to be processed by Iroha, to be passed to consensus, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 22 Sep 2018 18:38:44 GMT):<br/>
*Yasir* _via telegram_
Since signatures are signed by users, and we can have many users per network but only few nodes. And consensus is made among nodes only. No?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 22 Sep 2018 18:40:04 GMT):<br/>

If we are making APIs to make txs, we would need to feed in the private key of the tx_creator in order to do that? Since its needed to for the signatures. @la_sintez @kitsu @nikolay_sora

*[Kitsu](https://t.me/kitsu)* _via telegram_
Technically yes, without private key the one cannot issue a transaction.

Another question about key. My friend ask this but we not really understand. Say web user send request to Python API (Iroha python sdk at the back), so how tx creator signs? What we're doing is python api receive request URL: `/transfer?from=alice&to=bob`, then python sdk will handle:
`
tx = tx_builder.creatorAccountId(creator) \
        .createdTime(current_time()) \
        .transferAsset(sender, recipient, asset_id, message, amount).build()`

So by making web request without any signing, anyone can send asset to anyone @@

*protobuff requests. Transactions and queries. To generate a 'request' (transaction or query, e.g. addAssetQty/createAsset) you don't need to have an Iroha, you only need SDK aka client library (in Python, in Java, in JS, etc.) Just like you don't need to have a server on a client side to create a post/get request.

@liralemur @la_sintez  I got the point but I can't do anything on the client side as I am connecting a phone app to bunch of iroha nodes (VMs) I created on cloud. I just have the option of creating APIs to connect to the app. I can only store keys of users on the nodes if that's a secure idea?

Yes app will have to be the client. It would translate to the same thing as if I keep all the keys at my vms and make transactions from there. That way there won't be any priv key in the api.

You can't add "can_transfer_my_assets" to a role. This is a Grantable permission. User "someone" should grant this permission to "admin@test", so "admin@test" can manage "someone"'s assets. Please refer to

For example:

I just using jmeter to test for my app performance, stimulate for production. My scenario is that 100 new user will sign up, then transfer coin to user A, then user A send back, then repeat 3 times, finally get balance of new user. All at once.

For 800 sample (each sample is an transaction), only about 150 first transaction iroha was able to process, but the time to process increasing until its timeout at 60 seconds.

Unless you've enabled "Unlimited mode" (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/burstable-performance-instances-unlimited-mode.html) for this instance, it's performance is pretty low. On t2* instances you earn burst credits when instance is in idle state (i.e., not spending CPU cycles). I suggest to move to either c5* or m5* instances if you demand high performance. So, the main performance hit is caused by low CPU count and Burst credits you've spent running tests

Hello, followers of #IrohaWeekly!

Last week was quite productive. Iroha is changing, getting better — new ways, new ideas. Faster and more reliable.
Here is what we achieved:

Improved: 
- Return set in MstState::getBatch -now it is faster: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1722
- CommandService by refactoring its code: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1716
- compile time by removing unnecessary template instantiations in YacGateImpl: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1728
- AddAssetQuantity benchmark — it is now 2.5-3 times faster: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1701

Added:
- tests for GetRolePermissions query: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1710
- tests for running Iroha with —overwrite-ledger flag: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1709
- freeConnections method, which disposes all currently used connections: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1727
- support for deploying Iroha on Kubernetes cluster: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1697
- factory for query responses and tests: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1724
- method to detect if Postgres is ready before running Iroha: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1745

Fixed:
- CURL for more security: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1734
- Dev Build: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1741

Replaced:
- static Jenkins build agents with on-demand ones: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1733
- proto builders and shared_model objects in YAC tests with mocks: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1730

Removed:
- amount_utils since they are not used: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1581
- EnoughSig response in processBatch: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1738

Hope you all have a productive decentralised weekend! 🖖🏽

Forgive my ignorance, but there's just so little out there available to read about the Iroha (and even other projects of the HL). Every site seems to be selling the same copied info from the hyperledger page. What is the main difference between Iroha and Fabric?

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 29 Sep 2018 15:27:16 GMT):<br/>

I am considering suggesting our team to move our project from Ethereum to Hyperledger. Does Iroha offer support for events and logs (of transactions) and looking them up, or will I have to implement it myself? Thanks in advance 🙂

Hello! Have you checked out the docs here: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/? It's a great source about different features and their implementation (including queries - these are actions to retrieve data without changing its state - which might help with your case 😉)
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 29 Sep 2018 15:51:29 GMT):<br/>
*[Sara](https://t.me/liralemur)* _via telegram_
About the differences - I believe it depends on the use case - can't really tell much about Fabric but I believe the main difference is the way the things (transactions, for example) are done. Simplicity is one of the Iroha's main features as well as C++ on which it is written and different clients libraries.

Iroha is a framework on which you can create your own projects. It is used for building permissioned decentralised systems. For example, in your own organisation to store data. 
Iroha was created by Soramitsu and then it became a project of Hyperledger.

If you are sending just one transaction at a time and waiting for it to commit, then the average wait time would be `proposal_delay`. You can try sending transactions more frequently, so that `max_proposal_size` would be triggered earlier than `proposal_delay`. Try tuning these two parameters
</p>

Oh. Cool. If I am to send only one tx at a time. Say 3-5 txs per minute, I should just reduce `proposal_delay` and `max_proposal_size` ?

Is it the delay before sending the vote for block to the next peer in consensus. In the best case, the first peer in the order will collect the votes and share the outcome with the network. When the first peer in the order does not share any consensus outcome message with the network in `vote_delay` time, vote is sent to the next peer.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 15:01:47 GMT):<br/>

Got it. Thank you so much.

One last question, if I have to restart the whole network with different `config` file and an updated iroha version, can we still use the blocks created by the old iroha network? (Keeping the genesis block same as before ofcourse)

`

  "proposal_delay" : 5000,

So if there if > 10 proposal, proposals will be sent.
If <= 10 proposal, but more than proposal delay: 5000 (millisecond? nano second?), all proposals will be sent.

@kitsu @lebdron 
- `max_proposal_size`: ... we recommend to increase this number if you have a lot of transactions per second.
- `proposal_delay`:  You can start with 5000 and increase this number if you have a lot of transactions per second.
- `vote_delay`: Optimal value depends heavily on the amount of Iroha peers in the network (higher amount of nodes requires longer `vote_delay`)

On my event it will be peek 300-400 transactions/s can you guys suggest an optimal value 🙏🙏🙏

It's an interesting bug, it allows me to add the second node but then because it can't seem to communicate with that second node I can't submit any transactions because there's njot enough votes
</p>
<p><strong>anteatersa</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 09:59:24 GMT):<br/>
I've redone it using your link but now I see this on the second node:

Payment tokens tend to not work out so well when fiat is still accepted. However, if it's like a voucher, then it could work out fine as a coupon if it's pegged. Say 1 token=1 month. It'd be great actually. (I haven't watched the video yet. I'll do so later)

If you have multiple iroha nodes and an admin on one creates a new domain (e.g. bank1), do they own that domain? Or can other admins still add users/assets to that domain?

Can i deploy a project of decentralised taxi ride on the phone?.

I dont wanna use GPU for thie purpose.

So the algo involved with them (searching a ride, price calc, etc etc) i referred them as heavy algo.

So is our phone (in public blockchain) capable enough to handle and execute them.

the only "heavy" calculation your phone makes, to execute smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain, is to properly sign the transaction if you are doing a write operation to a smart contract. Read operations are infact free of charge, because that is just reading the smart contract state.

Same for Iroha. Though it is theoretically possible to run Iroha node on mobile device (we didn't try though), you just need to sign and send transaction to Iroha network. Or to send a query to get some info from the blockchain.

I would not like to promote ethereum in an hyperledger channel... But a possible solution could be, if you do not wish to pay any gas costs to the public ether network, to run a private ethereum network. This uses proof of authority as consensus protocol and is pretty easy to setup. You do this on normal servers in datacenters. You program your smart contracts in solidity and deploy them in that private ether network. Your phone can use the web3 api to connect to your private chain and execute smart contracts basically at the cost of running your private netwok. You can also wait for ihora to mature and deploy ihora 😊

Actually this stupid idea  (if it is then) came up in my mind when i saw electronium mining via phone although it unable gpu mining too. 

But then i thought to make a project on decentralised taxi ride combined with mobile mining keeping the basic concepts same. Like that of crypto currency where miner gets some rewards.



So wanted to make project something like this.


Customer makes a payment to driver. Thats added to pool. 

Mined and added to ledger. 


So is there any flaw in this?

Or whole thing is just stupid?

Seems to me, it will require the mobile devices to mine which might not very efficient as I understand it. Though I believe other members of the community would be able to give a better feedback. If there is only a client request from the mobile phone which is being processed on another node… The idea of decentralised taxi sounds good in general 🙂

https://www.npmjs.com/package/iroha-lib/v/0.2.1 should work with latest `stable` build (e.g. iroha 1.0 beta 4). Please note that it won't work with `deb1 branch and `hyperledger/iroha:develop` image. 

Now you are trying to instal 0.0.1 version of package, which is quite dated. That's why you get the error. Please update package in `package.json`

Anyway to access the container as non root? I feel so dumb here

you may connect it remotely
and I'm pretty sure there should be a default user created for postgres there

*Yasir* _via telegram_
Yeah That's what I am doing. I am trying to connect it through python. Its connecting with it fine but it needs a database name where all the tables are stored. I don't know what is the name of the database. I tried entering default database name which is `postgres` itself but its coming out empty.

*[Pavel Kotov](https://t.me/pkotov)* _via telegram_
Once I had a similar problem, I assume, Postgres in that case just did not create default database, so Iroha could not use it. Manually creating it solved the problem, maybe this is your case as well?

I figured that out. Thanks. But now i found out that transactions list are stored only in blocks. So don't know how to make queries directly from blocks... Don't know how query GetAccountTransactions is working... But I need something like that to pull transactions based on Asset. Something like GetAssetTransactions.

Hmm, it kind of weird. I'm the same team with @stronglong  , We are using Python sdk to connect with Iroha network via gRPC. Everything is fine unless today that bug appears and after overwrite ledger, everything would be ok 🤔

Its same as @stronglong. When you establish the network once and restart at least one iroha daemon in the network, all nodes will show the same message as shown by @stronglong in his gif.

I ran into this problem too. You need to explicitly specify the variables by str() before using the query builder. Convert every variable to string by str() and it will work. Dont know why its like that but stringing it solved for me.

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 03:15:20 GMT):<br/>
*[Vyacheslav Bikbaev](https://t.me/la_sintez)* _via telegram_
To be honest, I don't know about python syntax, but the idea is the following:
You query getPendingTransaction, you get transactionList, you take a needed transaction, (maybe serialization-deserialization could help), add more signatures to it (with usual means) and send it to Iroha back 🙂 I guess soon our other team members will wake up and give you some better insights.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=NFKWPg9YE2nobLGeX) @JieZou Hello! Iroha is a Japanese poem :) About the performance - it depends on the configuration of the system, number of nodes and other parameters. If you have a case you would like to use Iroha for, we could probably give you more information if you described it.

Hello, In case of Iroha mobile app use cases using iOS or android library, are the keys stored on mobile device or iroha server ?

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 09:00:42 GMT):<br/>
*[Vyacheslav Bikbaev](https://t.me/la_sintez)* _via telegram_
Iroha stores only public keys of an account. You should store private keys.
</p>
<p><strong>medhak19</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 09:42:41 GMT):<br/>
@SaraG  ok ...thanks for the response. So this means, with mobile apps, Iroha will store public key ...and mobile device will store both private and public keys as we need to specify both keys in our android/iOS SDKs...Is this correct ? 
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 10:40:51 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=uqDj9r8HXF3zfNHBs) @medhak19 You're right, public keys are stored in Iroha (in the ledger). You only need to have a private key on your client side - you can get public key anytime if you have a corresponding getSignatories permission.
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 10:54:56 GMT):<br/>
You can derive public key from a private one using crypto lib.

Hello everyone! 

I am here to tell you about new features, fixes and other improvements in our #IrohaWeekly 

- The team added a batch parser and transport factory for a nicer code: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1750
- Removed wsv_query dependency from chain validator: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1754
- Fixed sonar-scanner URL: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1769
- Added directory removal in tests: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1758
- Updated block event: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1751
- Fixed stateful validator execution time: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1778

We also reduced compilation time by:
-  moving string builder implementation to cpp: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1765
- using variant_fwd.hpp in command.hpp: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1764

Have a great weekend, 
Your Iroha Team 🖖

Hey guys, been looking into a few hyperledger frameworks the last few days and have installed Iroha, which is much simpler than fabric and should do exactly whats required

Are the docs being updated? Is there any blockexplorer being developed currently? Guide for setting up multiple peers manually? Just trying to search around and find as many tutorials that I can find for the project I'm working on :-)

Hello, thanks for the interest in our project. Probably you haven't enough RAM to compile. Try to reduce the number of threads (-j parameter). If it is not help, share with us the information about your PC and how do you build, please. We'll try to solve the problem. Consider using a docker, it is possible to run Iroha in couple commands, this comes in very handy.

Iroha docker uid issue

When I launch the script
`
$ sh scripts/run-iroha-dev.sh`

it launches image with my host’s uid=501(alex), but the repo dir, which is shared with the host, is owned by uid=1000(iroha-ci).
And to fix the problem with permission on writing to that dir from the docker image, I need to exit from the docker image console and connect to it manually with uid=1000 using the command:
`
$ docker exec -it -u 1000 iroha501_node_1 bash`


I use:
VirtualBox 5.2.19-125724
Docker Toolbox version 18.03.0-ce

Regarding the version, you can download  the documentation as epub or pdf for your eBook on the same site, it provides some options under the menu. There is also a Getting started section - it contains the detailed explanation of how it all works.

Regarding the examples, we do not have much than this at the moment - Iroha can be used for very different use cases. Though we plan to add some later. Do you think some videos on building Iroha would be of use in your case?

So I have 2 questions hopefully I could find any lead. 

1. My currently setup is 1 host 4 node (this could be separate to 4 host with 1 node on each host). I'm finding a set of params for config.docker file. As I'm summary in here: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/issues/1748#issuecomment-429899538. Can you guys recommend a params value set. The estimate peek is about 400-500 transactions/s

2. Is there any way to backup currently running network. As this issue IR-1737, I can't start the network again, I have to delete everything and run all fresh again.
</p>
<p><strong>igor-egorov</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 15:47:54 GMT):<br/>
Hi
1. This is a subject of experimentation :)
2. The issue is going to be fixed soon. There is already opened pull request https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1773

*[Kitsu](https://t.me/kitsu)* _via telegram_
I can help you with the second question. Iroha maintains state via blockstore + wsv, so i think it's enough to backup them
Probably postgres on itself has some utilities and for blockstore you may just copy folder.
Though there's a possibility of an issue there: if the commit happen during the backup the things probably goes wrong. So you mmust ensure there's no activity on the node. That's indeed is issue and I hope we consider fixing it soon
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 15:49:35 GMT):<br/>
As for the second issue I witnessed how to relaunch Iroha with existing blockstore. It was tricky since proposal height has to be set manually but still it is possible.

Hi all. May I ask you what are the main differences between Iroha and Fabric? Two weeks ago I had a try on Iroha, and worked fine. And now, wanting to get deepen into hyperledger technologies I'm wondering what are the main strong points of Iroha compared to Fabric
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 09:17:39 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=Z2zLMbrfEPypaSDkL) @sorabot Hi Marco! Well, Iroha and Fabric are both blockchain frameworks but with different ways of operation, configuration, different consensus algorithms. You have already mentioned one of the peculiarities of Iroha - you try it and it works :) it is easy to configure and set up (if you follow our 'getting started' example, it wouldn't even take 10 minutes to build your first Iroha network). It is written on C++ which is also a thing :) and libraries for mobile client applications.  Anyway, choice of a framework usually depends on the needs of the project you have in mind. 
</p>

*[Marco Ippolito](https://gitter.im/marcoippolito)* _via gitter_
Hi Sara! If framework usually depends on the needs of the project, which are the main different use cases of Iroha with respect to Fabric? I have in mind a project with a blockchain infrastructure among companies belonging both to the same "industry" and to different industries. So "allied" companies, but also competing ones. As far as what I've read both Fabric and Iroha allow to build sub-ledgers or channels among sub-groups, and both,  if I got it right, allow smart contracts building among parties of a sub-ledger or among the "main" big ledger.... So.. a part from the things you mentioned : written in C++, easy to configure and set up (claimed also by the modular plug-and-play structure of Fabric)...what are the specific use cased of Iroha compared to Fabric?

Reading this recent interview to Makoto Takemiya  https://cmun.it/e/z6g4ow1k/hyperledger-iroha-interview-takemiya-149724.html?t=1539682112  it is confirmed what I felt as something to understand it better during my first try with Iroha: it seems that Iroha does not have fully customizable smart contracts. Does it mean that we cannot develop our own smart contracts?

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 09:44:18 GMT):<br/>
*[Makoto Takemiya](https://t.me/mtakemiya)* _via telegram_
Iroha has built-in smart contracts as the core commands right now. They are not currently easily customizable, but this is an area of open research. You can customize your logic by forking and adding new commands for now.

Thanks a lot Makoto . Another major personal concern is the Client Library: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/libraries.html is it foreseen in the near future a C++ Client Library? Being Iroha written in C++, and being C++ my core development language, I would, prefer to use a C++ client

Though this particular bug is merged, there's still another issue I am working with right now, which will not allow empty blocks - those which do not have transactions, for example, stateful validation decided that all transactions in proposal are bad - to be comitted, and this will end in inability of unsynchronized peer to catch up and work with other ones, if at least one such block was comitted after it got down. But, this will be fixed soon.
Please, tell us, if the issue will appear again/

Thanks for clearing out, but on your opinion what cause this? Here is my error flow: I sent a fault transaction for testing purpose, asset ammount > user balance, then I got this error
</p>

Fault transaction does not pass stateful validation, but something needs to be committed after the consensus, and this something is an empty block - block without any transaction. If your transaction had passed validation, it would be there. This empty block tries to be applied to local storage, but for now it can't due to bug, and this causes peer to try to fetch another block from other peers, thinking the next one will help. Finally, it ends up in infinite loop

Best explaination 💪!!! I guess before I dont get this bug due to I'm running on only 1 peer.

Absolutely, it appears iff consensus committed something during peer's shutdown, and this is not possible when less than 4 peers are in network

@wazikazani if you want to just try out Iroha, you don't need to build it, you can try using our Docker images instead. Check out http://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/

A bit later contributors will help you with this build issue. Please tell us which branch you are using.

Hi, I am not sure who to contact about this. I have an Android app integrated wth Bigchaindb. I would like to do the same with Iroha.

Hi! Can we create custom queries off of blocks? Need to pull transactions for specific user which should include both (tx made, tx involved in) I know we can pull all txs made by a specific user. In same way, 2 3 more queries are needed directly off of blocks... Can someone please direct me?

Again, reading about the configuration tips https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/configuration.html#environment-specific-parameters and try to implement as suggested: raise max_proposal_size and proposal_delay on handle a lot of transactions.

Here is my setting:
max_proposal_size: 400
proposal_delay: 5000
vote_delay: 400

Here is the result with an individual request using Postman: 6-9s.

Using jmeter tool, I sent 400 transactions in 1 second and here is the result:

95% of the transactions failed. If I understand correctly, max_proposal_size: 400 and
proposal_delay: 5000 means that on receiving >400 transactions or after 5s, all transactions will be processed at once. I wonder why first 268 transactions failed already? It should have wait 🤔

hi! for what purpose do you need that? At the moment we do not have such support, but since in Iroha you can replace any components with your own, like use your own cryptography, database or consensus you can use GPU if it is required by your component

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=oxyFwmi4YZhFkamgf) @Kamil_Salakhiev We need a fast chain to support social level payment service. You may know that the mobile payment service is very popular in China. If we use blockchain technology to compete with them, the performance problem should be resolved. So using GPU to improve digital sign and verification should be the necessary way, If there is no official road map for this feature. We may plan to develop it. Welcome for any advice for this. my email is jzou3700@gmail.com

<p><strong>Kamil_Salakhiev</strong> (Fri, 26 Oct 2018 12:12:19 GMT):<br/>
This sounds very interesting. Although you need clearly define the advantages of GPU usage. As far as I know, GPU works the best when you have a small task that you need to run a lot of times in parallel (Single instruction, multiple data).  Is that a case in your project?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=dL5vSCSkYBEfMzjRr) @Kamil_Salakhiev In case of heavy workload on server, CPU should be faced challenge of  heavy workload of digital sign and verification, GPU has hundreds even more cores than CPU has. I suppose these cores can accelerate concurrent DSA caculation. As we know that SSL have the RSA algorithm which can be accelerated by hardware, DSA algorithm should be accelerated in the same way. Without hardware acceleration, CPU should be the bottleneck. 100MB network throughput per second can carry almost million transactions. That is much more faster than DSA calculation performance on CPU.

On my Iroha implement I'm running Nginx with Python SDK. I'm having this issue, when a lot of transactions come in, if some of them wait for too long (>60s) nginx will return timeout, while python sdk still have them in queue. This leads to imcoming requests keep waiting untill timeout, waiting for previous chunk to be processed.

I have another question, if my config is as follow:
`
max_proposal_size: 400
proposal_delay: 5000`

Does it mean if after 5 seconds, Iroha will process all receiving transactions, even just 1?
Does it mean if receiving 400 transactions under 5 seconds, Iroha will start process all *at once*, all 400 tx in 1 chunk?

If my understanding is true, why I send all 400 transaction at once but Iroha only return result 3 requests each time, 3 requests on 11s, 3 requests on 25s and 3 requests on 39s. I think I should have result of all 400 requests at once, since all of them are processed in one chunk?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=cLQ6hzy5NyqBmJzXf) @jpeeters Hello and welcome! :) These two frameworks are different in many ways though I can highlight some peculiarities of Iroha that might be of interest. 
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Sun, 28 Oct 2018 10:31:07 GMT):<br/>
That could also help you with your decision.

</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Sun, 28 Oct 2018 10:36:45 GMT):<br/>
So, Iroha is written on C++, it is easy to understand and build (which makes Iroha really stand out) and there are different libraries for different languages as well - so there are many ways to operate things (really important when doing open source in my opinion). Iroha also have a multi-signature option that would allow to set a quorum to several keys to verify the operation - it was recently used in a new project and showed itself very useful. 
</p>
<p><strong>jpeeters</strong> (Sun, 28 Oct 2018 10:36:56 GMT):<br/>

Hi @SaraG 
</p>
<p><strong>igor-egorov</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 10:24:52 GMT):<br/>
jpeeters, regarding your questions: current Iroha network topology contains only validators, and eventually we will have replicas too (not our nearest plans)
</p>
<p><strong>jpeeters</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 10:48:46 GMT):<br/>
@igor-egorov Ok, got it! What do you mean by replicas? PostgreSQL replicas? Ledger file replicas?
</p>
<p><strong>igor-egorov</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 10:51:45 GMT):<br/>
Every peer in the network has own instance of PostgreSQL. That is required for fast queries processing. In postgres we all the time have the relevant latest state (no need to count every block in the ledger)
</p>
<p><strong>jpeeters</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 10:52:14 GMT):<br/>
@igor-egorov I've got a few question on security:
1) Is there a kind of private channels? Are domains such kind of isolation between users in the same ledger?
2) Are file storage agnostic on storage technology? Object vs block storage?
3) If you have only validators, that means that any peer take also parth in validation, doesn't it?
4) Are peers authenticated and/or identified using certificates, meaning that both newcomers and established peers can do mutual authentication?

Originally I meant ledger replicas. By validator I mean the node that participate consensus and has the ledger history

By "replica" I mean the node that does not participate consensus, but still has all the blocks history. Now we don't have replicas, only validators

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=rmQHs2WDasB9rwn5N) @igor-egorov OK, great, but as a side effect, all validator consist in a copy of the ledger history, so they act as a kind of replicas, isn't it?
</p>
<p><strong>igor-egorov</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 10:54:01 GMT):<br/>
That is true

<p><strong>igor-egorov</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 11:35:22 GMT):<br/>
1) Is there a kind of private channels? Are domains such kind of isolation between users in the same ledger?

Iroha does not have private channels. Indeed, domains provide a way to access restriction to some degree. There are a set of commands and queries that accepts three kinds of permissions: permission to execute the cmd/qry on own account; permission to execute the cmd/qry on an account from the same domain; a permission to execute the cmd/qry on any account in any domain.

2) Is file storage agnostic on storage technology? Object vs block storage?

Most likely I did not get the question. If you are asking: "Can we NOW use OpenStack Swift or Amazon S3 object storage as a site for Iroha block storage?" Then the answer is no, BUT it is always possible to implement missing connector.

3) If you have only validators, that means that any peer take also parth in validation, doesn't it?

Any peer does stateful validation. Otherwise, there is no way to produce a vote for consensus.

4) Are peers authenticated and/or identified using certificates, meaning that both newcomers and established peers can do mutual authentication?

Currently, peers do not perform mutual authentication. There are two ways the network discovers peers: 1. peers are specified in genesis block. 2. peers are added via addpeer command as a part of some committed transaction
Secure channels for internal network interaction are to be introduced

Before we used SWIG generated bindings, they're still available, though not really supported. If the clients require native performance and not limited to additional stuff to be shared among them, that probably a good choice.
For now we are working on the self-sustained bindings that independant from other langs
Such lang bindings are quite slower probably (I guess we haven't tested it yet, might be Java+JIT could run even faster), but that really rare to have such client performance requirements. If so, then a better idea to use C++ directly

<p><strong>jpeeters</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 08:45:51 GMT):<br/>
@igor-egorov adding object storage support would be a interesting point to me. Aside, the lack of private channel is a problem for my use case. I need strong isolation between group of users, meaning that they must not share history, either using permissions but also through storage. As far as I understand, even if a peer is not permitted to exexcute cmd/qry it stores history of everthing...
</p>
<p><strong>igor-egorov</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 08:49:24 GMT):<br/>
Since a peer(a node, server, etc..) is a part of network, it participates consensus and will contain the ledger history. There is no way to restrict peer ability to accept users' transactions or queries via permissions. The only thing you can do - revoke all permissions from a user, thus the user can do nothing
</p>
<p><strong>jpeeters</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 08:56:49 GMT):<br/>
@igor-egorov ok got it, then how works private channels in Fabric ?
</p>
<p><strong>igor-egorov</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 09:04:46 GMT):<br/>
afaik, Fabric private channels work as a subledger over peers.
</p>
<p><strong>jpeeters</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 09:48:08 GMT):<br/>
@igor-egorov what do you mean as "subledger"?
</p>
<p><strong>jpeeters</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 09:51:10 GMT):<br/>
a kind of ledger tree ?
</p>
<p><strong>igor-egorov</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 10:37:07 GMT):<br/>
This is the first line of documentation about channels: "A Hyperledger Fabric channel is a private “subnet” of communication between two or more specific network members, for the purpose of conducting private and confidential transactions." https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.3/channels.html
</p>
<p><strong>igor-egorov</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 10:38:09 GMT):<br/>

@igor-egorov what have motivated the choice of C++, is that Iroha targets mainly embedded and mobile devices?
</p>
<p><strong>igor-egorov</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 13:26:49 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>igor-egorov</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 13:26:50 GMT):<br/>
speaking about mobile devices... Yes, Iroha can run on Raspberry PI or something like this, but it's not worth it.

We use templates as you probably noticed if you have took a look to the source code. This is a great feature of C++ and our shared_model component for instance uses it a lot. 
Now we support only C++14, but we might move to C++17 as soon more compilers support it. 
We don't have Iroha written in Go or Rust, so we cannot benchmark their performances, but I think C++ is fast enough, isn't it?
</p>
<p><strong>igor-egorov</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 13:46:38 GMT):<br/>

@Kamil_Salakhiev, @igor-egorov Ok great! I am not saying this a bad thing (I wrote tons of code in C++ for years) but I mitigate the choice comparing the few number of developers that hardly implement correct/stable/efficient C++ (even more C++14 or 17) vs. lot of developers that easily implement "average" Go ;-)

hi, everybody! thank you for the interesting project based on excellent idea! I believe in ongoing development of Hyperledger, really like all of its the advantages.
I’m looking at it as a very perspective platform. 

As an experienced trader I’m not mistaken usually and used to work with good platforms only. 

By the way I invested in MGO token (provided by MobileGo) when many people said me not to do it (its price was low before). But now MGO price has started rising fast to the moon (after the partnership with Xsolla particularly).  

Your project also has a bright future I hope. Wish you good luck!

if you need better performance, link ed implementation against amd64-64-24k (only linux amd64). it is around 4x faster than ref10 (portable default implementation)

in traditional oltp system, the TPCC benchmark have bottleneck of storage IO. There is no IO issue of blockchain. Why does all blockchain platforms weak on performance? If we deploy a 1 node iroha system. can it get much better performance then multi-node system?
</p>
<p><strong>Warchant</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 10:38:55 GMT):<br/>
there is huge network overhead, because multiple peers need to reach consensus through sending lots of messages. with single peer you get better performance, but there is no case (besides dev env) when you need only 1 blockchain node

We do however get >10k tx/s for byzantine read operations and about 2k tx/s write operations with confirmation latencies of about 20ms. Which should be the ballpark of iroha, but I havent deployed it myself. It should probably be faster because its c++ and we do it in nodejs

<p><strong>luckychess</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 12:27:40 GMT):<br/>
Currently when you send a transaction to Iroha you have 2 different ways to receive its status: 
1. use Status call which only returns transaction status at the moment of receiving it or 
2. use StatusStream which sends all statuses from a transaction pipeline until transaction will be committed or rejected.
At the moment we have a problem - if you send a big (~several megabytes or more) transaction and subscribe to it with StatusStream, you will probably get a timeout without receiving committed or rejected. It happens because we suppose that transaction status can't remain the same for some fixed amount of time - but that's not always true for very large transactions.
We have several ideas how to make things better:
1) Increase amount of time we can wait. A drawback here is that grpc threads will remain alive for sometimes a very long time. That's could be solved by a manual thread management but it requires a significant effort to implement.
2) Just drop large transactions (e.g. larger than 1Mb). Very easy to implement but somebody might need those.
3) Leave everything as is. If you need to use very large transactions you will face with some inconveniences with status retrieving.
As we decide on this, we really need your opinion about that - or, maybe you have some other ideas on how we could resolve the problem together?
Looking forward to your feedback!
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 13:05:25 GMT):<br/>

>2) Just drop large transactions (e.g. larger than 1Mb).

how about making it configurable? All timeouts and tx size can be configured in JSON, for example 
</p>
<p><strong>luckychess</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 13:36:55 GMT):<br/>
Configuring of max tx size can bring problems since each node can has its own value. Transaction can be stateless invalid or node one but committed on node 2 which will bring all network to inconsistent state.

You won't see your message immediately in the mailing list. It takes time for groups.io to send it to everyone, I guess this is the way this service works

>Configuring of max tx size can bring problems since each node can has its own value
This true also for delay for vote, proposal, and other options in config.json, but they are still there. 

Make it to the genesis block then. 
You can define special command, which accepts this configuration, and execute it only once from genesis block

<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 15:34:40 GMT):<br/>
typically, open source projects post an RFC email to their mailing lists that kicks off the discussion
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 15:35:10 GMT):<br/>

You might need to build a library if it isn't available in your package managers, so you can use it in your application. 

As for Iroha, you don't need to build it at all, you can use docker or pre-built binaries.

right there it was written in a very specific manner, i already run iroha on an instance on my compute engine, but those docs seem to be talking about building and deploying iroha on kubernetes, from my understanding though
</p>
<p><strong>artyom</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 06:32:07 GMT):<br/>
k8s cluster deployment part of the guide contains AWS-specific variables indeed. You can either tweak the playbook for GCE or deploy a k8s cluster using other means (e.g., kops). The second part of the guide (Deploying Iroha) is applicable to any running k8s cluster regardless the cloud provider you're using.

So to be clear, iroha stores most of the relevant data; accounts, roles, assets, etc... in the postgres db which I can lookup, but connects to the "iroha platform" (an external network from mine, i assume) to run validation, process transactions, etc?

@neewy @luckychess you need to be a subscriber to send mail to a list. I manually approve some of the queued emails. A lot of them are spam, and some are approved by other people.

<p><strong>wazikazani</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 02:27:35 GMT):<br/>
@sudomann i knew about that already, because there is a part in the docs that talk about listing peers on the iroha network, that's why i was like use those 2 instances as peer nodes on the network communicating with each other.
</p>
<p><strong>wazikazani</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 02:35:35 GMT):<br/>
but before getting there, we would need to deploy iroha on gcp, which i thought it was not possible until @artyom had to clear that out for me, that's the main goal now. even though i tried building iroha, but it did stopped at 90%.
</p>
<p><strong>sudomann</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 02:43:42 GMT):<br/>
@rjones  i agree please remove

<p><strong>sudomann</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 02:44:44 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>sudomann</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 02:45:57 GMT):<br/>
I saw nothing in the example that could be done on gcp. The author merely chose to deploy on aws, just as anyone else could've chosen gcp and shown the gcp-specific steps
</p>
<p><strong>wazikazani</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 02:55:00 GMT):<br/>
lol, yeah but i am just a student and needed confirmation from the teachers right here, i did not want to embark on a lost journey, that confirmation right there just saved me time, you were a student too, knew nothing much about iroha.
</p>
<p><strong>wazikazani</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 02:58:05 GMT):<br/>
@sudomann now getting to postgres db, the same db used by the iroha network, should be standard all through the application, again i read part of the docs that was specific to this, said iroha would not be able to handle multiple postgres db.
</p>
<p><strong>wazikazani</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 02:58:56 GMT):<br/>

it is not necessary to hardfork, because you don't need to do expensive PoW as in bitcoin or similar tools. 
peers may just re-create the whole blockchain in case of protocol upgrade

*[Makoto Takemiya (Soramitsu)](https://t.me/mtakemiya)* _via telegram_
Then depending on the block height (this is relative to each network), the conditional logic is used. A negative block height set for this condition could just designate a “brand new network”
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 03 Nov 2018 03:22:06 GMT):<br/>

May I ask when will this PR 1763 will be merged and develop docker tag available? Cause we will release in next couple of day, so as soon as possible we should using this commit. if i not wrong, we can't change the genesisblock without overwrite the whole block, means that delete all production data

Hi everyone! I used Hyperledger Caliber to benchmarking Iroha. But it seems many errors.  I tried grpc@1.12.1 and iroha-lib@0.1.7 but it make error. Does anyone success in benchmarking iroha with caliper

I'm going to have Iroha on production in next couple of days. Here is my concerns:
- The performance is still not real product capable, with my tuning right now I only have about 90tx/minute, roughly 1tx/s (I'm using python sdk, create a webserver to handle request)
- We need a way to backup the network. Should be supported natively by Iroha
- Say if some of peers die, we could start them again and sync with remain peers.

Hello everyone! 🖖

Here are some news about what is happening with new Hyperledger Iroha release and some breaking changes that must be announced. 

First of all, due to technical issues with DCO check, Beta-5 Release is not merged yet. There is not much we can do from our side, unfortunately, but we are doing our best to provide it as soon as possible. 

And now about some breaking changes into development branch after the release. There are 2 of them:
1. Key format change - https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1763 
We were going to merge it last week but due to controversy about this solution it is currently delayed for approximately 1 week. 


2. Block change - https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1815 
We changed the block to save the rejected transactions as well as part of future solution for replay attack resistance (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack). The block change has been already merged into development branch. Please make sure your Iroha is compliant. 

!These changes will not be included into Beta-5 release and only affect development branch at the moment! 

Please let us know if any of the points needs any clarifications - we will keep you updated on the situation. 
We also welcome your feedback.

Hello!

We are going to develop a network testing tool for Iroha to check various cases including inter-peer interactions with it. You are welcome to comment on:
the design draft: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1apu-RndZMBFX51BxDoZTBzIY8s11coS8EeRGV3HqViE/edit?usp=sharing
and the test cases for it: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nlfo-wtcLag-Qhiv7f__lh-rzkVFDOvu9Z1InWBjVn0/edit?usp=sharing

</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 11:03:22 GMT):<br/>

For example after some send asset transaction, all user asset will back to "x" amount
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 11:17:22 GMT):<br/>

Just for our use case, we want to have a demo first, user will send coin to people, then we will reset everyone balance to default "x" value and start a real one.

Since we are a blockchain, "reset" everything = everyone should transfer everything somewhere. Or to restart the network and delete history. For your case I would really create a "technical" asset, so there is no need to do anything with it.

Hi. About this, is there in way in pipeline to accommodate block structure changes without need of reset of the whole network? As this is very critical as people are going to use this in production.

Then depending on the block height (this is relative to each network), the conditional logic is used. A negative block height set for this condition could just designate a “brand new network”

Cleaver way to accommodate block changes, if implemented should solve your problem in production Yasir

Hello everyone! 

Another change that could potentially break the code: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1837 - new errors were introduced.

It only affects the part of the code that deals with errors though.
Please check it so it is up-to-date

That path DOES NOT EXIST in the repository
</p>
<p><strong>sudomann</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 04:05:40 GMT):<br/>
After that it also says "There is an Ansible role for setting up k8s cluster. It is an external module called Kubespray. It is stored as a submodule in Hyperledger Iroha repository. This means it needs to be initialized first:

`git submodule init && git submodule update`"

That submodule DOES NOT EXIST in the repository either, I tried at `cat .gitmodules` from repository root, turns out there is not `.gitmodules` file because the repository does not contain any submodules!

@sudomann it's a long and sad story, the problem was in DCO I guess. We are working to solve this problem so there is only one "develop" branch :) For now please stick to `dev` (if you want all new features)

Nope, config works fine. Most probably  you are using outdated java library.  At some point we have changed the response protobuff files, so Iroha returns status code 5 (which used to mean MST_EXPIRED), but now it means COMMITED.

Iroha postgres can be access using docker cli 

`
sudo docker exec -it iroha-postgres1 psql -U postgres`


I wonder if I change user data, for example someone can gain access to the database, they will change account_has_assets amount, will Iroha validate on blockchain side (stored on tmp folder if I right) rather than database side?

blockchain will not be changed, but eventually network will understand that this peer is faulty (when new transaction comes that uses changed data). 
Assuming you have 4 peers or more (so BFT consensus algorithm can tolerate at least 1 faulty peer), faulty peer will drop the whole database and re-create it from the blockchain

Hey all I'm working on the k8s ansible, adding secrets for iroha pods - would there be any preference to storing the private keys in a single secret that's shared between multiple nodes?

<p><strong>artyom</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 13:27:26 GMT):<br/>
It only makes sense to create a separate secret for each Iroha private key. genesis.block and public keys can be in a single shared volume. AFAIK, we now share private keys between nodes in a .spec file, which obviously requires a better implementation. We would be glad to accept a pull request from you if you create one.

To maintainers and contributors to the project,

I am happy to say that there aren’t many items left in the backlog for us to postpone release candidate of Hyperledger Iroha.
Our diverse and distributed team delivered novel design decisions in Iroha over several years, and we would be happy to move forward with code freeze and rc1.0 in December 2018.

We have to meet some formal needs, imposed by the policies of Linux Foundation & Hyperledger, and one of them is DCO or Developer Certificate of Origin. The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing to the project. 

It is done by adding a Signed-off-by line to commit messages, usually with -s command-line option in git.

This policy was imposed from the very beginning of the project, since day 0. However, its enforcement and checks were introduced later, which might have confused contributors, who ignored this policy before.

In order to move on with DCO issue, we possibly need to modify commit history. Since all our contributors accepted terms and conditions and expressed their wish to contribute by formerly creating pull requests in GitHub I don’t see any legal limitations for maintainers team to choose one of the options:
Squash the history of old commits and rename squash-commit them by adding a sign-off message
Rewrite each commit manually
Any other option?

I would be happy to know the opinion of everyone about this problem. As we have 4396 unsigned commits I would like to continue with option #1 and move forward with is if no-one has any objections based on legal or ethical grounds. We will make a decision on 28th of November and inform the community over email and rocket.chat.

Any ETA on the beta merge? Puting a hold to our blockchain ledger in anticipation of the merge as it will have a format change of blocks.

<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Tue, 20 Nov 2018 15:00:43 GMT):<br/>
Hi Yasir! If you mean the key format change - it will not be included in beta-5 anyway, as was previously announced. If there is something else, could you please clarify that?

No just the key change. Is there anything else that can break the network with the update?

<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Tue, 20 Nov 2018 15:07:59 GMT):<br/>
The breaking changes come after the release so it should not be affected if that's what you mean

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 20 Nov 2018 15:10:16 GMT):<br/>

Of course. But if we want to upgrade to the newest release, we would have to reset the ledger to t=0 (wipe everything off)

Yasir, I can see the problem :( 
there are breaking changes (several of them) and some of them will be included in beta-5 and some probably in beta-6. And if the beta-5 is already waiting for DCO problem resolution and otherwise ready, beta-6 still has some things to finish. 
We will soon have a planning meeting (in 1-2 days) and I'll be able to update you on the ETA after that with more clarity

Hi! What is the best way get the transaction status after sending it to iroha network via Python SDK? So far I am using the `get_status()` function from `tx-example.py` its working fine normally but when I test txs in a loop, it does not give a good response. `NOT_RECEIVED` is the status sometimes but in reality, the txs are committed.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 18:17:39 GMT):<br/>
*[Rory](https://gitter.im/bagf)* _via gitter_
I don't use the Python library for my project but check status is rather simple. it might return the status NOT_RECEIVED but I usually just keep checking in that case until I get a validation error or committed status.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 18:19:07 GMT):<br/>
*Yasir* _via telegram_
Yeah I had to put in a 2 second delay to check the status, and it started returning committed status.

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Wed, 21 Nov 2018 18:23:01 GMT):<br/>
*[Rory](https://gitter.im/bagf)* _via gitter_
I would like to know if there's a async method to listen for status updates - I haven't worked with the native bindings yet so I could have missed something. Read recent commit messages regarding a 'status bus' which if exposed would allow my system to trigger code on successful transactions (its more important while multiple creators can't be part of the same payload)

Yeah, just check asynchronously with status stream. Method returns observable. On next = next status change, onComplete= transaction is committed. onError = something went wrong

the Scala Protobuf actually returns a iterator so status makes sense the error will be in a tori response via next()

*[Vyacheslav Bikbaev](https://gitter.im/laSinteZ)* _via gitter_
@bagf Well, "NOT_RECEIVED" is not an error. It is a valid status and (in most cases) it is a first status of a transaction (if you manage to send streaming request earlier than Iroha got the transaction)

cool makes sense, in a distributed system there's a good chance I will request the status of a transaction on a peer that didn't get the payload first

Very exciting and important Iroha news everyone! :slight_smile:

As you may noticed, there had been some really important changes recently - breaking changes, new features, beta-5 release (that is coming very soon now). 


Nikolay revealed the reason in his previous announcement - we are preparing a release candidate version of Iroha to get from beta to production in mid-December! And we need your support on that. 


We appreciate your choice of Iroha for your projects and want to thoroughly discuss what is coming and answer all your questions. For that, we invite you all on a call meeting on Sunday, 25 November, at 11am EST.

The agenda is the following:

1. What we have for release candidate

2. What will happen with the breaking changes

3. How you could help us shape the first production version of Iroha. 

We will also be happy to answer questions or discuss features with you.

Did you drop drop the tables in postgres manually, or restart docker without persistence?

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 16:45:28 GMT):<br/>
*Yasir* _via telegram_
Node got down somehow, I restarted `irohad` but failed due to error that table is not found, I checked and found that postgres docker is also not running, I might have replaced the postgres container with a new one.

Hello! Not sure it is the right place to ask but maybe u can point me where I can i find the information. I was reading the use case about selling a red car in the documentation (cross-border asset transfers) but I did not understand how the « offer » is implemented in practice. Does it require an account dedicated to transactions between haruto et haru with the users as signatories (since the quorum is an account property) or is there a better way? Thanks for the help.

@laSinteZ Thank you! Probably my explaination is wrong. I already use  iroha-wallet-js develop branch, cloned with -b develop flag. But it doesen't matter. My main answer is how can ""recompile classes from new .proto files"" . As I tried to explain I'm trying to write my own Nodejs client , following the example tutorial, I got the pasted error above. I know some gRPC stuff are changed that's why I got error 12 UNIMPLEMENTED

@alessandroponzo iroha-wallet-js relies on usage of `iroha-lib 0.1.9` which is compatible only with https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/tree/v1.0.0_beta-4 (current stable release, `master` branch, `latest` image). Long story short: you can't just recompile protobuff files, since builders from c++, which were compiled to iroha-lib, changed as well.

As it was suggested before, you can try using https://github.com/soramitsu/iroha-helpers (which is constantly updated to work with `dev` branch and `develop` image), but not __all__ commands are supported (even though we use it for some internal projects). We are in process of writing better library.

Hello! :vulcan:

On Monday we will be merging another change that will break the genesis block: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1893

It will change the structure of the block for the future implementation of Iroha versions, so it is a very important one. 

Please be aware of the change and contact us in the community if you have any questions.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=74hA2khQmDrdomDHW) @zeallous Hi there and welcome! 🖖
</p>
<p><strong>zeallous</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 01:44:30 GMT):<br/>
im just going through edx HL course. So are there any updates on teh iroha ordering? is it still vulnerable as a center point of failure?
</p>
<p><strong>zeallous</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 02:25:31 GMT):<br/>
is there a way we can be in close contact with the founders. I have a big project that I may want to do on iroha. Mobile driven.
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 07:42:14 GMT):<br/>
Hi @zeallous ! There are no founders, but maintainers team I guess :) You can talk to us directly in rocket chat. It is such a perfect time to ask the question about Ordering Service as we are merging distributed implementation, so it is not going to be SPoF any more
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 07:43:54 GMT):<br/>
Unfortunately edx HL course is a bit outdated, and we are looking forward to update it soon, as we are approaching release candidate, and hopefully after TSC release we will release Iroha v1.0 in January :)

Sometimes we are asked "Where we can learn C++ in order to start contributing to Iroha codebase?"
There are numerous courses available:
English https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus
Russian https://stepik.org/course/363/ https://stepik.org/course/7/
I think that other community members can suggest other courses as well, so please share links and other helpful materials.

Basically you should be familiar with language, some parts of C++14 standard, and fundamentals like data structures and algorithms. If you might have any setbacks with specific libraries we are here to help you and guide you — just reach out to community here or in mailing list. It is helpful to use git blame as well.  
</p>
<p><strong>zeallous</strong> (Wed, 05 Dec 2018 01:38:47 GMT):<br/>
so what does that mean, can you explain? Does it remove the center point of failure?
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Wed, 05 Dec 2018 14:38:34 GMT):<br/>
 In short yes
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Wed, 05 Dec 2018 14:40:03 GMT):<br/>
Ordering service responsibility is delegated to peer network. Each peer is selected to be a proposal generator each round, similarly to the way YAC algorithm defines order of peers in voting phase
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Wed, 05 Dec 2018 14:40:44 GMT):<br/>
if any of proposal generators is down, the rest of peer network will use next peer in the order

Hi everyone. I'm trying to build an iroha network with multi computers. Each computer uses docker for running a node. I have followed the instruction by this link: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/deployment.html#running-multiple-instances-peer-network. I choose Manually section 5.3.2.1 and here is my step:
step 1: I generated peers.list which contains IPs of computers in network.
step 2: I parsed peers.list file to iroha-cli and get genesis.block, node<key>.pub, node<key>.priv
step 3: I also generated docker-compose-<key>.yml for each computer. File contains configuration of 2 containers: iroha-node and postgres db. I have already set params --genesis_block, --config, --keypair_name for iroha-node container.
step 4: I copy folder contains files in step 2 and 3 to other computers. After that I ran docker-compose-<key>.yml in each computer and got running containers.
step 5: I ran iroha-node container bash in computer A. I choose New transaction -> Create Asset -> Send to Iroha peer. I entered IP of computer B in network and I got an error "GrpcResponseHandler UNIMPLEMENTED". I have checked iroha-node in computer B and it had no logs 

Did i build iroha network in remote computers correctly? I have checked many links but still got no answer.
Here is my network configuration: https://github.com/megafyk/iroha-network

Many thanks for your help!

Unfortunately our CLI is outdated right now. If you can use python example code or java or other library this would help us understand the root cause of this issue. We are actually very close to stop development of Iroha features and focus on CLI, documentation and platform stability. 

Also, I am not sure really that you need to build everything on your own. If you can use https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/iroha/ "latest" image, which points to beta-4, CLI is going to work actually. API has changed recently in dev branch
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 11:01:39 GMT):<br/>
I hope that helps. You can find tx-example.py file in source code, or use CLI with beta-4 version

In near future we will stop support of the current CLI. Some functions are already not available. Please try to manually edit your genesis block. If you need to add more peers, you can add peer command in genesis block

{
          "addPeer":{
        "peer":{
            "address”:”peer’s address”,

Hi all, does anyone has case study kind of thing for hyperledger implementation. I mean, how the business was and what benefits did hyperledger bring after implementation
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 10:16:58 GMT):<br/>
*[Sara](https://t.me/liralemur)* _via telegram_
Hi! It all depends on what use case you are interested in 🙂 

For some cases blockchain is great - for example, Iroha was used for this project: https://d3ledger.com/ and I simply love the way the Hyperledger Iroha technology was implemented there. 
For some cases maybe centralised solutions are better.

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 14 Dec 2018 10:22:36 GMT):<br/>
*[Kitsu](https://t.me/kitsu)* _via telegram_
Blockchain usually solves the issue of trust. If peers trust (including system security from hacking) each other the main feature of distributing of trust becomes meaningless. Nevertheless some HL framework still might be a good solution for your case, at least because they are almost self-sustained and requires less amount of effort for creation target system (with some cool properties included).

Well, he we talk about one of the Hyperledger blockchain frameworks - Iroha. Hyperledger's projects are open-source so people here also decide on what will happen with Iroha, contribute to it in different ways.

Iroha is a simple and fast blockchain framework on which you can base your projects.

I would recommend you to take a look at d3ledger.com, a project that reuses identity, asset creation and atomic exchanges in Iroha heavily. It has public code, available at github.com/d3ledger. Its' primary goal is to provide a hassle-free service for institutional investors, that want to use tokenized assets, but lack a solution/service

What Nikolai has sent you is mostly a reference of how Iroha could be used in similar situations I believe :) currently Iroha does not have a smart contract solution but we want to create it and the community is ready to help if you decide to contribute it and use for your project.

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sun, 16 Dec 2018 08:52:53 GMT):<br/>

Btw, Iroha is good for creating client applications on mobile devices and it has multisignature option that might be interesting to you, based on what I've managed to understand)
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sun, 16 Dec 2018 09:08:23 GMT):<br/>
*[Mike Papaiacovou](https://t.me/mconsocio)* _via telegram_
How does that apply to the use case?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sun, 16 Dec 2018 09:24:30 GMT):<br/>
*[Sara](https://t.me/liralemur)* _via telegram_
For example, p2ps are very easy to make in Iroha + the libraries for mobile applications.

Then, as I understood, you could use multisignature to confirm some operations with several keys, not just one. Though, those are just my guesses, I believe you know your project better :)

My background is in business mostly not in computer science, that’s why I have more questions than answers on what you say :)

Is there a document describing Iroha for business applications?

There is a general documentation paper right here: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
We are updating it at the moment, coming closer to release, so there might be some errors but in general it describes Iroha in a simple and generally correct way )

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=rWsHLN4wvPcef69p5) @coderintherye Hi! Let me see...
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 20:56:19 GMT):<br/>
I was trying that today or so I thought
</p>
<p><strong>coderintherye</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 20:57:46 GMT):<br/>
thanks, I figured it out, the tutorial assumes you dont enter into the iroha directory but rather are outside of it
</p>
<p><strong>coderintherye</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 20:58:12 GMT):<br/>
if one is inside the iroha directory, then the -v $(pwd)/iroha/example:/opt/iroha_data does not work
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 20:58:42 GMT):<br/>
yeap, just checked it :) 
</p>
<p><strong>coderintherye</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 20:59:26 GMT):<br/>
Now on to the next issue:
"[2018-12-17 20:59:12.330287315][th:13][error] MAIN Failed to parse genesis block.

</p>
<p><strong>coderintherye</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 20:59:49 GMT):<br/>
im going to try to delete the image and re-run things, in case there was any issue in setup
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 21:00:07 GMT):<br/>
Are you using the master brunch? 
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 21:00:47 GMT):<br/>
Oh, I get the same one. 
</p>
<p><strong>coderintherye</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 21:01:08 GMT):<br/>
no, i was on master, but i switched to "develop" as it seemed like that was what the tutorial wanted
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 21:01:58 GMT):<br/>
I think I am getting that error on deveop
</p>
<p><strong>coderintherye</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 21:03:45 GMT):<br/>
maybe https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/issues/1324 ?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=ojHr3fsiRs63ughou) @coderintherye so it worked? Could you please share your steps? I'd like to understand on which stage I get that and fix the tutorial 
</p>
<p><strong>coderintherye</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 21:04:07 GMT):<br/>
no i'm still stuck at the above error, but going to try the suggestion from https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/issues/1324
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 21:05:25 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=p3dRb5CX26t7Lr38D) @coderintherye Lots of things changed after that - probably the image was not changed after the recent release candidate. 
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 21:05:43 GMT):<br/>
But in general that could be the exact issue 
</p>
<p><strong>coderintherye</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 21:06:18 GMT):<br/>
yeah seems like it would require editing genesis.block in a few places to be in the same state as it was shown in that issue
</p>
<p><strong>coderintherye</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 21:06:28 GMT):<br/>
perhaps though doing what the later suggestion will work?
"If you have time, please try running Iroha docker-container with hyperledger/iroha:x86_64-develop image"
</p>
<p><strong>coderintherye</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 21:06:30 GMT):<br/>
i can try that
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 21:07:08 GMT):<br/>
I think develop could work - recent changes were all shown in dev branch. 
</p>
<p><strong>coderintherye</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 21:07:15 GMT):<br/>
thanks for the responses by the way, nice to know there are folks in here looking at things :)

<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 21:08:48 GMT):<br/>
Versions were recently introduced to the genesis block. We are getting ready for backward compatibility :upside_down: 
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 21:09:52 GMT):<br/>
Tell me how it goes, ok? 
</p>
<p><strong>coderintherye</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 21:10:17 GMT):<br/>
@SaraG Yes, "dev" branch worked when I switched to it, so maybe just update tutorial to indicate use "dev" rather than "develop" ?
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 21:11:45 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Mon, 17 Dec 2018 21:13:20 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>coderintherye</strong> (Wed, 19 Dec 2018 00:28:51 GMT):<br/>
there's a couple of issues with this paragraph in the getting started:
"Now try adding some coolcoins to our account. Select 16. Add Asset Quantity (add_ast_qty), enter Account ID – admin@test, asset ID – coolcoin#test, integer part and precision. For example, to add 200.50 coolcoins, we need to enter integer part as 20050 and precision as 2, so it becomes 200.50."
</p>
<p><strong>coderintherye</strong> (Wed, 19 Dec 2018 00:29:27 GMT):<br/>
one is that upon choosing 16, there is no prompt for "Account ID", rather it skips to asking for "asset ID"
</p>
<p><strong>coderintherye</strong> (Wed, 19 Dec 2018 00:30:47 GMT):<br/>
two is that the text that comes up in the cli is:
"Amount to add, e.g 123.456:"
however, the documentation makes it seem like we should be inputting 20050
</p>
<p><strong>coderintherye</strong> (Wed, 19 Dec 2018 00:32:18 GMT):<br/>
the second issue isn't a bug, just confusing. the first issue may possibly be a bug, i'm unsure of why there is a discrepancy and if the "Add Asset Quantity" command, 16, should ask for an Account Id or not
</p>
<p><strong>coderintherye</strong> (Wed, 19 Dec 2018 00:34:03 GMT):<br/>
Also in 2.3.2 it states we should choose
"7. Get Account's Assets (get_acc_ast)"
However, in the current branch, that is actually 8., not 7.
</p>
<p><strong>coderintherye</strong> (Wed, 19 Dec 2018 00:34:17 GMT):<br/>
let me know if it'd be helpful to create a PR to fix that discrepancy

Before I consider updating and working on a PR I would like to know:
What are the current plans while iroha-pure-java is available and is used internally with existing projects? Should we maintain our own version in iroha-scala or drop it in favor of the iroha-pure-java with scala interop?

Hm. I'm personally not sure about that, I think we'd need maintainers for that, so answer to this one could take some time) 
I see a lot of requests for smart contracts lately, so I think that would be considered after first release. Though I'd need some confirmation from maintaining guys)

Whats the difference between the docker image for iroha (https://hub.docker.com/r/hyperledger/iroha) and the python sdk (https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/libraries/python.html)?
</p>
<p><strong>sudomann</strong> (Mon, 24 Dec 2018 07:02:00 GMT):<br/>
I wanna try building with it in my django application, but not sure exactly which to use. My django application is dockerised and runs on kubernetes, so I dont know whether I should set up another kubernetes deployment for the docker image, or or just install use it directly within my django app
</p>
<p><strong>sudomann</strong> (Mon, 24 Dec 2018 07:03:36 GMT):<br/>
The former seems like more work (if possible) for more security, and the latter seems easy to do, and straightforward but jumbles my application and iroha in the same space.
</p>
<p><strong>sudomann</strong> (Mon, 24 Dec 2018 07:13:12 GMT):<br/>
Also, can I use domains like this:
I have 2 users, Alice and Bob. I create a domain Alice-Bob, in which I can set privileges for Alice to transfer assets to Bob (one way only), and Bob to transfer assets to Alice (one way only) ?

Docker image is a daemon which you need to run first. Python sdk is a client library that you use to communicate with this daemon

Hi Sara! Thanks for the response. I used a `dev` branch in my project and it was working awesomely for our needs. However I was still unsure about the scaling of the network for multiple txs per sec and wondering to see if that has improved in the RC1? I'll wait on Production Ready version too.

We work here on consensus questions (if you want to join the talks, let me know!) and trying to collect feedback on Iroha and enterprise blockchains in general (to know what features might be requested in Iroha - so much to know before the release!). 
Do you know any great resources for that? Maybe some forums or chats? Or maybe you have something to say? We would really appreciate that! 
You can share with people here or, if you would be more comfortable that way, write me a personal message :slight_smile:

<p><strong>sudomann</strong> (Thu, 27 Dec 2018 00:49:29 GMT):<br/>
Trying to setup iroha in a network of peers; At https://hyperledger.github.io/iroha-api/#create-genesis-block it says:
"Iroha-cli tool is used to generate keypairs for every peer, mentioned in the peers list. This is done only for convenience — in production environment please consider using manual or more trusted approach.
"
</p>
<p><strong>sudomann</strong> (Thu, 27 Dec 2018 00:49:49 GMT):<br/>
What would a more trusted approach be?
</p>
<p><strong>sudomann</strong> (Thu, 27 Dec 2018 01:56:53 GMT):<br/>
To make sure I understand how it goes:
```iroha-cli --genesis_block \ 
--peers_address peers.list```
creates a genesis block alongside keypairs for user (regular) and user (admin), and keypairs for each node (from peers.list).
Now those node keypairs are what each node uses to communicate with the other nodes

<p><strong>sudomann</strong> (Sat, 29 Dec 2018 02:40:13 GMT):<br/>
Is there any benefit to having more than 3 nodes if I want to set up a peer network? If I understand correctly, each peer stores a local copy of the ledger (on disk) and not a piece each; So that means if I was processing a lot of transactions and scaled up to 20 peers it only costs me more without providing any benefits apart from verification by each peer involved?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=so8gF7wmMmYozGbfs) @coderintherye I've checked this, seems like a misunderstanding of the issue. The contributor that closed it talked more about it not working at all while you were talking about the documentation (or so I see it) :( Let me reopen it to begin with, so we could fix that during new sprint. 
And about that issue with the dev and develop - we really hope to get rid of one of them soon. We had to create and use dev because of some admin issues with develop at some point and the correct way would be to actually use develop in the future. So I think what we will do is we fix the dev-develop issue (after hyperledger admin team is in the office again from Christmas holidays) and if any mismatches in documentation remain we will fix those after. What do you think? Maybe we'll also ask to do something about closing the issues, it does seem unfair to close them without any notice :(

hey guys, just wondering, whats the point of having mobile client libraries in hyperledger iroha? cant one just use a rest API? 
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 16:12:39 GMT):<br/>
*[B V](https://t.me/bv_o0)* _via telegram_
hi. there is no rest api, there is only grpc api and client libraries consist of crypto, grpc and protobuf, in essence

Has anyone else run through the Node example? https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/libraries/nodejs.html
When doing so I get:
"TypeError: protoTx.getPayload(...).getCreatorAccountId is not a function"

*[Sara](https://t.me/liralemur)* _via telegram_
Hi! We were planning on few weeks but it all depends on stability of Iroha and decisions of TSC. The idea is the following - we'll be making release candidates fixing bugs until a Candidate feels stable enough. There should not be any breaking changes or major feature changes at this point though.

It would really help and speed up the process if we could discuss your experience with Iroha and the possible difficulties and fix it all quicker :)
</p>

Thank you for the response Sara. How many Release Candidates are out there? Is dev branch stable for now? Only breaking changes are concern though

*[Sara](https://t.me/liralemur)* _via telegram_
Well, we have RC 2 now but it's not merged into master yet. It must include all of the breaking changes at the moment. 

In general, there might be like 2-3 candidates before a major release or 99+ - it all depends on stability.

<p><strong>bagf</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 19:46:49 GMT):<br/>
Might be my fault, I updated the ansible example block. I'm not sure if I used the iroha-cli to generate that block or if I used the protobuf
</p>
<p><strong>bagf</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 19:47:04 GMT):<br/>
My understanding is iroha-cli isn't going to be supported? 
</p>
<p><strong>sudomann</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 19:48:57 GMT):<br/>
It actually states [here](https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/deployment.html#automated) that `iroha-cli` is not suitable for production, so I've been working on a script to replicate its functionality for my use

<p><strong>sudomann</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 19:49:29 GMT):<br/>

genesis block is no more than a set of transactions.

if you know Java, you can check my GenesisBlockBuilder, it is capable of generating valid genesis blocks from java:

in short, genesis block must have height=1, txNumber=number of transactions in GB, and a set of transactions.
each transaction MAY NOT be signed.
block MAY NOT be signed. 

valid genesis block contains at least one domain, according role assigned to domain, at least one peer, at least one account

https://github.com/sudomann/useful-scripts/blob/master/iroha-cli.sh#L22
well, this is not going to work :)

standard ed25519 uses sha2-512 hash function, in Iroha we changed it to sha3-512, so any existing ed25519-sha2 implementaitons will not work (this was done intentionally).

you can use C lib: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-ed25519 (or even generate your own bindings for your favourite language)
or my CLI: http://github.com/warchant/ed25519-cli
or python lib: https://github.com/Warchant/pyed25519-sha3
or java lib: https://github.com/Warchant/ed25519-sha3-java
</p>
<p><strong>sudomann</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 20:00:59 GMT):<br/>
So to be clear when you use "may not"; You're saying transactions and blocks can be signed, but its fine if they're not?

it is better if you sign, but Iroha does not check signatures, because usually GB is quite often modifited by hands
</p>
<p><strong>bagf</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 20:01:46 GMT):<br/>
when deploying iroha. Do you foresee that there is an official way to generate blocks?
</p>
<p><strong>bagf</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 20:02:21 GMT):<br/>
Will the creation of a block generator part of the production?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 20:02:35 GMT):<br/>
*[B V](https://t.me/bv_o0)* _via telegram_
it is not the official way, and you may see some generator after release. it is quite hard to maintain stable block structure and generator(s)
</p>
<p><strong>bagf</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 20:02:54 GMT):<br/>
understood
</p>
<p><strong>sudomann</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 20:03:51 GMT):<br/>
I am building a product that will use Iroha, and I can't see myself manually modifying blocks, so theyre gonna have to be signed and automatically generated
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 20:04:15 GMT):<br/>
*[B V](https://t.me/bv_o0)* _via telegram_

This has baffled me all afternoon:
In settinging up a peer to peer connection between iroha nodes, I know I needed to generate a keypair for each node; I initially generated them using 
```
ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 -f  demo_key_name -C "" -N ""
```
which would give me files:
```
demo_key_name

I was told in here the keys from that wouldn't work and given alternatives;
from which I chose `ed25519-cli`.

Is uses iroha-ed25519 library, available in Hyperledger GitHub repo
</p>
<p><strong>sudomann</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 08:10:14 GMT):<br/>
Therefore it does essentially what [this](https://github.com/Warchant/ed25519-cli) does?

That tool outputs a what it labels as public and private key, but they look like sha signatures, and i was told here earlier than a change was made from cha2 to sha3

<p><strong>sudomann</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 00:16:24 GMT):<br/>
I see in Kubernetes deployment of Iroha, 4 peers are created/registered, as shown by `addPeer` key [shown 4 times in the genesis block](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/dev/deploy/ansible/roles/iroha-k8s/files/genesis.block) vs only 1 time for the [single node deployment with docker example](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/dev/example/genesis.block).

It is my understanding that the `quorum` key is a sort of constraint for the minimum number of peers that must validate and sign the transaction for it be valid. How is it that there are 4 peers in the kubernetes deployment, but you guys opt to have only 1 validate and sign? I was thinking maybe when initializing on each node, that does not matter since its a genesis.block, but I can't be sure, as I dont yet understand Iroha's internal working to that extent.
</p>
<p><strong>sudomann</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 01:31:55 GMT):<br/>
Also, I noticed they had a key named slightly different: `blockV1` vs `block_v1`. Which should I be using?
</p>
<p><strong>igor-egorov</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 05:07:19 GMT):<br/>
Quorum is an individual setting for each account. A part of MultiSignatureTransactions feature. In case of enabled MST you can link any quantity of keys to any account on the ledger, then raise the quorum number for some account (should not be greater than amount of linked keys). 
</p>
<p><strong>igor-egorov</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 05:08:31 GMT):<br/>
When you submit some transaction from an account with quorum greater than one and signatures less than quorum, Iroha would not process the transaction till all the signatures will be collected.

In the logs it seems that all the nodes continously look for treansactions, find it to be empty and then try again. Is this something normal?

Ok. In Python SDK, I am getting either "NOT_RECEIVED" or "ENOUGH_SIGNATURES_COLLECTED" in the status. However in the logs, I am seeing a few "Commits" in the irohad logs too. Can someone please tell me why the mismatch?

*[Sara](https://t.me/liralemur)* _via telegram_
So, the thing is that tutorial is for a single-node instance, that is why second port is not mentioned. The logic seems correct but still, it would be wise to add a note for multiple node example too. Can you make a Jira ticket please and assign it to me?

if you send valid tx, then it must be something like
ENOUGH_SIGNATURES_COLLECTED
STATELESS_VALID
STATEFUL_VALID
COMMITTED

i think better approach in your case is not to wait, but subscribe for tx status asynchronously
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 15 Jan 2019 15:39:27 GMT):<br/>
*Yasir* _via telegram_
Yeah but still there is a need for confirmation of the tx status as the responses need to be synchronous... Like creation of account returns with keypair etc. That's good in runtime
</p>

your business logic can be synchronous, but I would still recommend using async API

you can implement a subscriber for tx statuses, and once you hit terminal status (like COMMITTED), then you release thread and continue

<p><strong>sudomann</strong> (Thu, 17 Jan 2019 06:42:31 GMT):<br/>
I've got a few nodes on which I've managed to get iroha peers running on in a network, and I'm trying to understand how I then connect to it from my application with requests/transactions, etc.
Taking the following from the [python client library docs](https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/libraries/python.html#example-code):
Print transaction status with synchronous simple call:
```
def print_status(tx):
   # Create status request

   print("Hash of the transaction: ", tx.hash().hex())
   tx_hash = tx.hash().blob()

   # The work with byte arrays is different in Python 2 and 3
   # Check python version
   if sys.version_info[0] == 2:
       # Python 2 version
       tx_hash = ''.join(map(chr, tx_hash))
   else:
       # Python 3 version
       tx_hash = bytes(tx_hash)

   # Create request
   request = endpoint_pb2.TxStatusRequest()
   request.tx_hash = tx_hash

   # Create connection to Iroha
   channel = grpc.insecure_channel(IP+':'+port)
   stub = endpoint_pb2_grpc.CommandServiceStub(channel)

   # Send request
   response = stub.Status(request)
   status = endpoint_pb2.TxStatus.Name(response.tx_status)
   print("Status of transaction is:", status)

   if status != "COMMITTED":
       print("Your transaction wasn't committed")
       exit(1)
```
Where we have 
```
   # Create connection to Iroha
   channel = grpc.insecure_channel(IP+':'+port)
```
Would IP and port be the IP address of any one of the peers in my network and its associated port?

I'm not that familiar with GRPC but I read something about managed pools. Should be able to specify all the nodes and use round robin or a custom load balancer to send commands. It would probably be best to write your own balancer for fail over / HA of the Iroha service

There isnt a switch somewhere to reduce logging verbosity? I've got an idle network of about 20 peers and empty transaction entries are pilling in. Storage isn't really a concern now, but I'd love to not have to scan through pages and pages of redundant info when the time comes.

You're running postgres via docker, right? Try to launch via `docker run -d postgres:9.5 -c 'max_prepared_transactions=100'`

You may make sure, that param is valid by making a `SHOW max_prepared_transactions;` sql query (it shouldn't be zero)

*[Kitsu](https://t.me/kitsu)* _via telegram_
We've rewritten most of the commands (and maybe queries?) to the postgresql transactions (starts from `begin` and end with either `commit` or `rollback`, afair). Without support of preparing such transactions it will basically cannot be able making it in parallel (= block on each transaction).

Do we trust iroha peers to validate signatures and therefore clients don't have to? If so then peers are running / are some kind of PKI? Or should we be setting up PKI outside of Iroha to do signature validation?
</p>
<p><strong>pdxjohnny</strong> (Sun, 20 Jan 2019 00:00:23 GMT):<br/>
Sorry if that doesn't really make sense. I'm trying to figure out if I need to do anything client side to validate blocks. It seems like I would need to trust a peer and have a secure connection to it. Or else if a client connects to J random peer it would need to do block signature / public key validation using trusted PKI.
</p>
<p><strong>pdxjohnny</strong> (Sun, 20 Jan 2019 00:14:52 GMT):<br/>
It seems that lack of TLS, etc. between clients and peers would be a security issue as a MITM could trick a client who isn't validating OOB into thinking that a transaction has gone through which hasn't actually gone through. Which has led me to the conclusion that a client MUST be able to trust a peer (trust it to validate) if it is going to connect to it (and therefore must be able to trust the connection), is this correct?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=rP2HG8TcRbo9D5xgP) @pdxjohnny Since Iroha is a technology for private blockchains, the client trusts peers by default. If he does not trust one peer he can always try another. The system will work if there are no more faulty nodes than f of 3f+1. Client cannot validate blocks at the moment. TLS is an issue but there is a plan of implementing that after the release.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=tuKivrndKi2LEBFwn) @DarwinHarianto Hi! Seems that we've found the reason for that - in the latest version of Iroha (RC2) the format of keys, I believe was changed to Hex. The current library does not support it yet - but there is a new version of it already in review. We are expecting it in a few days. Meanwhile, it is possible to use the old one with RC1 though I do not really see much benefit in that. Btw, Darwin, please join us tomorrow on the meeting? I think it might be interesting and we'd be glad to meet you! (And here's a link with the PR for the new library: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-ios/pull/75)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=tuKivrndKi2LEBFwn) @DarwinHarianto Hi! Seems that we've found the reason for that - in the latest version of Iroha (RC2) the format of keys, I believe was changed to Hex. The current library does not support it yet - but there is a new version of it already in review. We are expecting it in a few days. Meanwhile, it is possible to use the old one with RC1 though I do not really see much benefit in that. Btw, Darwin, please join us tomorrow on the meeting? I think it might be interesting and we'd be glad to meet you! (And here's a link with the PR for the new library: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-ios/pull/75)

@SaraG thanks for the information.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=KnhA3wmSLBAAmByGd) @DarwinHarianto So sorry to hear that :( having people from all over the world is amazing but it comes with a price at times... Anyway, I'll make notes based on that, you'll be able to check them out later :) could you please clarify you question about data types? 
</p>
<p><strong>DarwinHarianto</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 07:54:06 GMT):<br/>
to make something like this

```
struct objectResponse: Codable{
    var clas: String
    var dataType: String
    var productName: String
    var owner: String
    var quantity: Int
    var time: String
    var country: String
    
    
    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
        case clas = "$class"
        case dataType = "dataType"
        case productName = "productName"
        case owner = "owner"
        case quantity = "quantity"
        case time = "time"
        case country = "country"
    }
}
``` this is written in swift.
In composer we can make a model like this, so it is easy for me to make a log and access all kinds of data in 1 object.

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 18:34:31 GMT):<br/>

If one node is returning `ENOUGH_SIGNATURES_COLLECTED` and others are responding with `NOT_RECEIVED` what would this mean?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 18:36:47 GMT):<br/>
*[B V](https://t.me/bv_o0)* _via telegram_
transaction was received and is known by peer which sends `ENOUGH_SIGNATURES_COLLECTED`

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 18:39:46 GMT):<br/>

so, you send valid transaction to peer1, then peer1 responds with `ENOUGH_SIGNATURES_COLLECTED` and nothing happens?

Hello everyone! Iroha Java library is now on https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-java

It is now a multi-modular Gradle project and has 2 modules:
1) Client - client SDK for Iroha;
2) Testcontainers - library for integration tests for Iroha.
No breaking changes were made - you only need to change the imports. 
You can import it using Jitpack: https://jitpack.io/#hyperledger/iroha-java

Hi everyone,

I'm trying to build Iroha on my Ubuntu container.  It ran for several hours until it failed with the following error.  Anyone have any suggestions?

Do you use several threads to build Iroha? What is your -jN parameter to make? Compiler often gets killed by a container, because it starts using too much resources, if several threads are spawned
</p>

This was the command I ran:

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sun, 27 Jan 2019 19:03:29 GMT):<br/>
*Chris Capitolo* _via telegram_
mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make -j$(nproc)

$(nproc) on my container is 1. Can you tell me or direct me to any documentation how to install using several threads? I'm not very experienced with using containers.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sun, 27 Jan 2019 19:07:39 GMT):<br/>
*[Pavel Kotov](https://t.me/pkotov)* _via telegram_
So you are building Iroha with one thread, and still the compiler uses too much resources. That's strange, as I got this error only when building it with 2 or more

Thanks, I used the docker update command to increase the memory for my container to 3G. I notice from the "docker stats" output for my container that the limit still seems to be at 1G, which doesn't make sense to me. I tried running my cmake and make commands again, but it failed again trying to compile that on_demand_ordering_init object after trying to for a couple hours.

Iroha has a set of commands (that change the blockchain) and queries (that only retrieve info). So I think it should work for you!

Okay, so I can't use asset to store string value. To do that I need to use the accountDetail attribute. At the end, I will need to open a customer account who will create another account for each product he will need. And for each change in product, the customer will store the change in its related product account in accountDetail. Could it be done this way?

I'm asking this because in `genesis.block`, I need to change the default keys for admin account. And I did not find out the key pair specification in documentation (or perhaps I missed it ^^)

Haven't you found iroha/example/node0.{priv, pub} keypar? If not, you can generate it via 
`iroha-cli --account_name NAME@DOMAIN --new_account`

But, this way, I will get the default admin keypair to start my Iroha and in the futur, someone can use it do destroy all by using the keypair in the git repository. Right?

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 14:52:06 GMT):<br/>
*[Mirrdhyn](https://t.me/Mirrdhyn)* _via telegram_
Or, start Iroha with the default keypair, then create a new one. Then, stop and install the new keypair in genesis.block. That's a good idea?

The command above itself will not start Iroha, only generate a keypair, which then can be used in genesis block. Then, you start an Iroha daemon itself

Hello, I'm new to Hyperledger.
I'm confused with "so many ledger" implementations: Fabric, Sawtooth, Iroha....
It's not clear to me how they compare, advantages and disadvantages of each implementation.
It's not clear to me which one I should concentrate efforts.
Could someone clarify, please?

<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 21:26:12 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=rP8bKw2uQ9xkmeHFw) @frgomes Hi there! There are frameworks such as Iroha or Fabric on which you can create your own blockchains and different tools
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 21:27:32 GMT):<br/>
They are different, I cannot say there is a one-fits-all solution. Iroha is easy to understand and build for example + different client libraries so you could make apps for different devices. 
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 21:28:05 GMT):<br/>
Can't say much about other projects though - not an expert in them, unfortunately
</p>
<p><strong>frgomes</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 21:32:51 GMT):<br/>
@SaraG : Correct. I've spent some time studying Fabric. Just studying, without spending time/effort writing any code. A good decision, I'd say, since today I've found that Iroha offers some advantages, apparently. I liked the idea of using Postgres in the case of Iroha.
</p>
<p><strong>frgomes</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 21:35:06 GMT):<br/>
@SaraG : Also, apparently Iroha focuses on providing an easy path for having something running on Android.
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 21:36:58 GMT):<br/>
Well, there's a new Java library that you can surely use for Android apps

</p>
<p><strong>frgomes</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 21:40:28 GMT):<br/>
@SaraG : I will spend some time evaluating Iroha before I decide which path I will take. I need to deliver something fast and, in this case, Iroha seems to be the way. I have already a skeleton for Android, written in Scala which would be easy to integrate with iroha-android-sample.

Hello! I tried again from scratch on a fresh Ubuntu and I got the same issue with the `develop` branch. I'm just adding the flag "`can_set_my_account_detail`" in the genesis.block file for the "`user`" role. I got the same in the master branch with the latest docker image. Can someone try to double check that I'm not doing something wrong please? Thank you ^_^

Hello, where I can find documentation regarding the steps of a transaction? In particular, how Iroha avoids and/or protects agains the "double spending" problem?

Before applying transaction it passes Stateless validation (check if input data is valid, i.e if a numer is represented in digits, but not letters), then stateful validation (it checks if transaction does not violate logical rules, i.e if user does not spend more than it has)

Hi! The thing is that it is a grantable permission. My colleague told me the following on that: “The only applicable permission for the role is can_grant_can_set_my_account_detail. That means that the owner of the role with the permission will be able to issue GrantPermission(toSomeone, with "can_set_my_account_detail" grantable permission).”

Hello @liralemur So, if I understand well, no need to set this flag in the role in the genesis block. I can set data in account detail for my own account.

The root cause for a recently worsened transaction status retrieval was an issue with RxCpp use, after all. Iroha maintainers team has identified the issue and merged the fix to master: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2075 
A bug with gRPC has not been identified — it may seem there wasn't anything. 

Thanks everyone for your reports! Please stay tuned and update to new docker image for the second hotfix 🙏

@DumitruSavva : Thanks for your message and I'm sorry for the long delay.
In Fabric there's validation, simulation and endorsement. As far as I understand, validation would be stateless validation in Iroha world and simulation+endorsement would be stateful validation. I hope I'm not too far from understanding. In Fabric there are issues related to  non-repeatable reads and/or phantom reads, which I suppose have to do with the decision of using CouchDB being the scenes. In the case of Iroha, since it uses Postgres... I suppose that such concerns do not apply, correct?

nice one. @iroa-devs, would it be possible to tag the releases in git? because I'm subscribed to "release only" in github to be notified of new releases and it'd be handy to get the notifications via mail. actually I think it works that when a new tag is pushed the mail is sent.

Hi Chris! I'm fixing the links in this PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/2078 Maybe that will be of help.

I believe you just need to set mst_enabled to true in your config, like this one: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/master/example/config.sample

Though I'm not very good in understanding python lib. I'll ask the author of the lib on Monday too :)

SWIG is a nice tool, but it limited portability in our case since it produced CPU-specific builds, so in order to debug an Android app and deploy it on an ARM-powered device we had to use two build. Via cross-compilation. It was a interesting experience indeed

@igor_egorov  Using the python client, is there any way to get more helpful/specific messages? I think i understand whats wrong wrong when for example. I create a user and domain, and get `'STATEFUL_VALIDATION_SUCCESS'`, then if I try to create the same user and domain again i get `'STATEFUL_VALIDATION_FAILED'`. If i understand correctly, I wouold get that because this user and domain already exist, but what if I did not realize that? How would I ever figure out what's making the transaction fail?

For example there is this segment of my output setting the age attribute fails even though all the other transactions are successful:
`
.
.
.
  Entering "set_age_to_userone"
  Entering "send_transaction_and_print_status"
Transaction hash = b'99c4978d33e41f3a4e0e63a66c13fc7790f44f32a17d46cd614a4fc9c8b4d08d', creator = admin@test
('ENOUGH_SIGNATURES_COLLECTED', 9, 0)
('STATEFUL_VALIDATION_FAILED', 2, 2)
  Leaving "send_transaction_and_print_status"
  Leaving "set_age_to_userone"

I'm not entirely sure if we're going to use this fork into production once 1.0 is released - the java option looks nice. Right now we don't have any java dependancies so not sure how easy it is to work with in scala. I could see allot of .asScala .asJava

<p><strong>frgomes</strong> (Tue, 12 Feb 2019 14:15:31 GMT):<br/>

1. dnsmasq must be running on the host, so that DNS requests from containers can be resolved. See: https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/userguide/networking/configure-dns/
2. Disable firewall in development before launching postgres and iroha containers.

Hello, I'm doing a simple PoC based on iroha-java/.../Example2.java, but written in Scala.
This is the code:
```scala
        import jp.co.soramitsu.iroha.java.{IrohaAPI, Transaction, TransactionStatusObserver}

        val api: IrohaAPI = new IrohaAPI(host, port)

        val tx =
          Transaction.builder(Admin.id)
            .createAsset("usd", defaultDomain, 2)
            .sign(defaultKeyPair)
            .build

        val observer =
          TransactionStatusObserver.builder
            .onComplete            (() => println("Complete"))
            .onError               (t  => println(s"Failed with exception: ${t}"))
            .onTransactionCommitted(t  => println(s"Committed: ${t}"))
            .onTransactionFailed   (t  => println(s"Failed transaction ${t.getTxHash} with message: ${t.getErrOrCmdName}"))
            .build

        api.transaction(tx).blockingSubscribe(observer)
        api.close
```where ``Admin.id = "admin@test"`` and key pairs are defined like this:
```scala
    val defaultKeyPair: KeyPair =
      Ed25519Sha3
        .keyPairFromBytes(
          parseHexBinary("0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"),
          parseHexBinary("43eeb17f0bab10dd51ab70983c25200a1742d31b3b7b54c38c34d7b827b26eed"))

    val peerKeyPair: KeyPair =
      Ed25519Sha3
        .keyPairFromBytes(
          parseHexBinary("bddd58404d1315e0eb27902c5d7c8eb0602c16238f005773df406bc191308929"),
          parseHexBinary("cc5013e43918bd0e5c4d800416c88bed77892ff077929162bb03ead40a745e88"))
```
If I sign with ``defaultKeyPair`` (as shown above), I obtain an error message saying "signature validation". If I substitute ``defaultKeyPair`` by ``peerKeyPair``, I obtain "wrong signature".

Ideas?

Solved. I have to sign with the keypair relative to the transaction builder (account id).
Moreover... the problem was pub and priv keys inverted, as you've pointed out.
```scala
        val tx =
          Transaction.builder(Admin.id)
            .createAsset("usd", defaultDomain, 2)
            .sign(Admin.keypair)
            .build

From the beginning of that log file: [[Wrongly formed peer address, passed value: '6iroha-5.iroha:50051'. Field should have a valid 'host:port' format where host is IPv4 or a hostname following RFC1035, RFC1123 specifications ]]\n"
in your genesis block, it appears to be prepending '6' to your peer addresses.

if you dont mind deleting your current data - try resetting the storage so it reads the same genesis block we're both seeing

I don't think there is a way to right now - but you can delete your volume claims for block-store-iroha and pg-data-iroha

Regarding the config generation script; I modified the ansible files from the repository and this is what I'm currently using: https://github.com/sudomann/sample-00000/blob/master/ansible/roles/iroha-k8s/tasks/config-gen.yml
</p>
<p><strong>artyom</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 17:13:55 GMT):<br/>
Iroha just shows the whole address it attempts to connect to, usually the address of another peer. Log entry should not confuse you as what actually happens is that Iroha first tries to resolve DNS name (without a port) using standard OS mechanisms. And, if name resolution was successful tries to send a packet to an IP address and the port that DNS name was resolved to. Log entry saying that `AsyncGrpcClient RPC failed` means the following: either name resolution has failed OR the name has been properly resolved but the remote port is closed. I see that you can successfully resolve DNS name. Which means that remote port is probably closed. 
</p>
<p><strong>artyom</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 17:17:04 GMT):<br/>
If you want to deploy the latest Iroha version you'd better off with Ansible scripts. k8s ones require refactoring. If you happen to come up with a proper fixes, feel free to file a pull request in Iroha github repo

I destroyed the clusters that i started out with, which generated the errors that got me started with all this, and it appears the cloud provider dumped the logs along. But `"OR the name has been properly resolved but the remote port is closed"` sounds like what was going on; Ports were initially assigned wrong, but a user, Rory, helped fix that yesterday.

regarding the iroha config being out of date - it appears even with the new settings i still had issues sending to port 10001 after a cluster reboot. The biggest life changer was the service port adjustments - will make the PR as soon as we get a chance

I dont know how you were planning to reach your peers, but I was going for exposing peers to each other through `10001` and beyond their namespace with `50051` only. I dont quite know the jargon, so I dont know how well thats described haha

The thing i hated most about the docker peering method even though its what i started with, is that it was easiest to set up over the open internet, and tedious (at least in my experience) to maintain within a subnetwork (I'd have to be concerning myself with the nuances of my cloud provider's networking features, etc.)

yeah that doesn't sound ideal - In our deployment we don't need to expose Iroha to the internet - We have a some applications inside different namespaces that connect to peers directly. With each cloud provider they have their own way of load balancing TCP connections - for google I found this article: https://medium.com/google-cloud/gke-grpc-ingress-loadbalancing-4b9cdbc09758 you should be able to setup a ingress that your external apps can connect to

Suggestion for iroha logging:

Also, must ALL peers defined in genesis block be present to participate in consensus, or is there a minimum number, percentage? Couldnt find anything in the docs explaining this. I noticed there's also no command to remove a peer. Is that by design, or just wasn't a priority enough to get developed?

docker run --name some-postgres \        
-e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
-p 5432:5432 \
-d postgres:9.5 \

There is some allowed number of faulty peers though I'll need to check tomorrow which one. It used to be 2f+1 as the amount of 'good' nodes where f is amount of faulty ones. But I believe now it's like 5f+1 model at the moment

This reminded me of the code here:
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/731d2c7afb5829f9ff716e4b8ff2bc986caca870/deploy/ansible/roles/iroha-docker/defaults/main.yml#L2

So to ensure I understand properly, there must be at least 6 peers described in the `genesis_block` (even if 5 of them are not actively communicating on the network for whatever reason). The point is, at least 1 needs to be working properly to receive transactions, even though other peers are unreachable?

You can change the number of nodes in the file for your network but indeed, if the number is less than 6 and some of the nodes get faulty, consensus will not work
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 23:33:40 GMT):<br/>
*[Sara](https://t.me/liralemur)* _via telegram_
But if all of the nodes are up you can make less than that. Though again, if any of them fails it's going to disrupt the network

when you pass -c after image name it does not refer to docker parameters. As stated in docker docs here:
`
Set options directly on the run line. The entrypoint script is made so that any options passed to the docker command will be passed along to the postgres server daemon. From the docs we see that any option available in a .conf file can be set via -c.`

I have 2 questions regarding that: 
1. Maybe someone else from the community is going to be there? Would be cool to plan activities together!
2. Maybe you could share links to your PRs (or other contributions) so we could show them as examples to people at the bootcamp? 
3. Maybe you have some other ideas that we could share with potential Iroha community members?

Hi friends, I am trying to write a function to listen on my local Iroha network. I tried to translate the Kotlin code in Dumitru's Twitter app.

The code I wrote so far is as follows:

int processListen(const Config& cfg) {
    std::cout << "starting listen" << std::endl;

    iroha::KeysManagerImpl manager("/opt/iroha/example/admin@test");
    auto keypair = manager.loadKeys();

    auto query = shared_model::proto::BlocksQueryBuilder()
            .creatorAccountId("admin@test")
            .createdTime(iroha::time::now())
            .queryCounter(1)
            .build()
            .signAndAddSignature(*keypair)
            .finish()
            ;

    torii_utils::QuerySyncClient query_client("localhost", 50051);
    auto respl = query_client.FetchCommits(query.getTransport());
    std::cout << respl.size() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

This hangs at the FetchCommits() call, even when I used iroha-cli to set a key-value pair for admin@test.

Another function in the same app for creating a ne domain works perfectly fine.

Hello @bagf : I've seen that you are using Ed25529 in your branch of iroha-scala.
However, as far as I know (and I may be mistaken) Iroha currently uses SHA-256 whilst Ed25529 employs 512 bits.
Am I mistaken?

    private static final EdDSANamedCurveSpec ed25519 = new EdDSANamedCurveSpec(
            "Ed25519",
            ed25519curve,
            "SHA-512", // H
            new Ed25519ScalarOps(), // l
            ed25519curve.createPoint( // B
                    Utils.hexToBytes("5866666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666"),

Iroha uses ed25519 as a digital signature algorithm. 
Ed25519 internally uses SHA512 hash as random oracle. Original ed25519 implementation described in https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/ uses SHA2-512, and they mention that SHA3-512 can be used. This change results in keypairs/signatures being different for sha2 and sha3 variants.

<p><strong>frgomes</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:30:05 GMT):<br/>
@bagf: I see this dependency: "net.i2p.crypto" % "eddsa" % "0.2.0"
However, iroha-java uses "com.github.warchant" % "ed25519-sha3-java" % "2.0.1".
I'm confused about these choices.

*[Rory](https://gitter.im/bagf)* _via gitter_
I'm not sure if i mentioned here - but i'm working akka-iroha as a replacement for the iroha-scala library - my goal is essentially write as little code possible yet still offer features like constructor assertions and crypto utils
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:36:09 GMT):<br/>
*[Rory](https://gitter.im/bagf)* _via gitter_
but akka might be a heavy requirement for most use cases just for ours it's already in use
</p>
<p><strong>frgomes</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:40:13 GMT):<br/>
Akka would be fine on the server side but it would be too much on the client side, such as Android.
In spite of my efforts, I'm not really considering using iroha-scala directly in the mobile client.
My intent is really enabling Monix on the server side for scalability, reliability, etc, etc which can be achieved with proper thread management.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:41:39 GMT):<br/>
*[Rory](https://gitter.im/bagf)* _via gitter_
yeah thread management is a thing with GRPC - I've decided akka would do great job managing a connection pool using it's internals
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:42:09 GMT):<br/>
*[Rory](https://gitter.im/bagf)* _via gitter_
as well as streaming transaction status from iroha transactions :D
</p>
<p><strong>frgomes</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:42:59 GMT):<br/>
My intent at this point is having a very lightweight client which just fires simple HTTP requests to the server side, which would be written probably in Finch.
</p>
<p><strong>frgomes</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:44:34 GMT):<br/>
However, to be honest, my initial driver for this work was understanding properly what happens behing the scenes.
When I found blocking calls and asserts throwing exceptions... I've decided that I had to do something.
</p>
<p><strong>frgomes</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:45:31 GMT):<br/>
I hope I can contribute with something useful :smiley:

the asserts are actually quite useful - they were setup to make your you don't handle an avoidable stateful validation failed status

*[Rory](https://gitter.im/bagf)* _via gitter_
I'm in two minds about them but having them as an option seems like a better practice?

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:47:20 GMT):<br/>
*[Rory](https://gitter.im/bagf)* _via gitter_
I think what we might be able to do is create a monix version for you lightweight backend and I'll create akka version

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:47:30 GMT):<br/>
*[Rory](https://gitter.im/bagf)* _via gitter_
maybe we just share pure scala code between the projects?

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:47:46 GMT):<br/>

things like key generation and possibly validation of input
</p>
<p><strong>frgomes</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:48:31 GMT):<br/>
Yes, sure... they are useful whilst developing, but I'm against asserts in production code.
Asserts are OK in a "design by contract" approach but, once again: asserts in production code is a problematic thing when we are willing to write code which never leaves unhandled conditions to occur.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:49:54 GMT):<br/>
*[Rory](https://gitter.im/bagf)* _via gitter_
ah yeah if a failure occurs it has to be handled - one thing that would prob help both of us a iroha validator that just allows impl the handle these errors in its own thread/method
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:50:34 GMT):<br/>
*[Rory](https://gitter.im/bagf)* _via gitter_
something like that is nice to have in production code so you never send iroha commands and wait for a response in the same impl
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:51:04 GMT):<br/>
*[Rory](https://gitter.im/bagf)* _via gitter_
generally speaking the strength of having a cluster validate your commands is that you never need to stall a thread past the tori grpc call
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:51:44 GMT):<br/>
*[Rory](https://gitter.im/bagf)* _via gitter_
but when you validate exclusively on iroha then you might opt to wait on that transaction status before returning to use?
</p>
<p><strong>frgomes</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:52:08 GMT):<br/>
I have the validation code using Try/Success/Failure in my branch here, in the first part of this file:
https://github.com/frgomes/iroha-scala/blob/RG0001-Code_review/src/main/scala/net/cimadai/iroha/Iroha.scala
</p>
<p><strong>frgomes</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:53:58 GMT):<br/>
Maybe I'm mistaken... but we validate inputs on the client side, build commands and, only after that, we send a grpc call, correct?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:55:14 GMT):<br/>
*[Rory](https://gitter.im/bagf)* _via gitter_
correct - but if we eliminate validation complete we would have to build the command and pray - so like this approach of having some kinds of client side validation - just curious why `BLOCKING: ` is above some of those commands
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:55:49 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>frgomes</strong> (Mon, 25 Feb 2019 21:58:15 GMT):<br/>
BLOCKING: This is because I started I wrote another apply() function which employed Monix, basically just callyng the apply() which is blocking. However, I've removed the apply() employing Monix. I will do that later, possibly on a separate layer of the library.

frgomes, I think it's better if you didn't use Monix's Task directly and instead abstracted over cats' Effect typeclass
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 10:29:30 GMT):<br/>
*[Richard Gomes](https://gitter.im/frgomes)* _via gitter_
Monix offers certain advantages over IO.
See here: https://monix.io/blog/2018/03/20/monix-vs-cats-effect.html
But the reality is that Monix and Cats are close enough and we can have distinct submodules for each, so that users can choose.
I'm restructuring the code in a way that Monix code goes into a separate submodule. Code dependent on Cats Effects can be implemented later.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 10:44:55 GMT):<br/>
*[Nikita Vilunov](https://gitter.im/vilunov)* _via gitter_
@frgomes I know it does, but often you can write code independently from specific effect implementation. In that case you don't even need to write two modules for Monix Task and Cats IO, you can simply pass Effect typeclass instance to the function  (via context bounds for example). Anyway, I'm looking forward to your finished code, maybe I could place a PR to do that

Hi. Could you modify the docker-compose script you provided in the following way:
- remove `args` section
- replace `command` section with `command: -c 'max_prepared_transactions=100'`
and try again?
This should start the `docker-entrypoint.sh` script, as it is the defualt entry point, and pass the contents of `command` section as arguments for the `postgres` binary inside it (https://github.com/docker-library/postgres/blob/master/docker-entrypoint.sh).

Hi, thank you for responding! When I create a domain, it works, but when I use a FetchCommits() query, it doesn't work.

I created a key-value pair using the iroha-cli to test my FetchCommits() code.

Hi Sara, thanks very much for the help!  I was able to use the instructions to deploy Iroha and run the daemon and test it with the iroha-cli.

My next task is to try to setup at least three containers on my system that are each running a separate instance of iroha and link them together with YAC.  My first questions are related to what I need second instances of and what I need to share with the first instance.  For example, I already have a docker network, a Postgresql container, and a blockstore.  Will I need to create additional instances of any of those when I create new iroha containers?  Any guidance would be appreciated.

By the way, I did see there's a link in the Getting Started page to a guide to setup several peers, but the page doesn't exist.

Hello, Chris! Glad to hear I could be of help 🙂 I am not sure but you might use new deployment scripts for several instances. We’ve had a meeting about that and you can check out the video (if you have time) as well as the scripts themselves. I’ll transfer them to the docs soon.

Till it would max out memory. I believe you were the one who suggested it might be a "cache warmup" or something of the sort? I was doubtful of that, because it would just keep using up more and more memory until peers would start failing

Hi Sara, thanks for the links!  I was able to configure three separate instances of Iroha locally on my system using Docker containers, but I'm not quite sure how to proceed with linking them together within a network.  The Youtube video and the readme both seem to apply to a Linux system host.  I'm running Docker on a Windows system to create my three Iroha containers.  The readme says to use the second option (Docker overlay network) for a local-only deployment, so I'm thinking that's the option I need to use.  If so, I think this means I should use Calico to configure a Docker overlay network between the Iroha containers.  I'm looking at the Calico documentation referred to in the readme, but I'm not sure which instructions I should be following there ("Manual setup" or "Vagrant install with Ubuntu", etc.)  If I'm reading the setup instructions right, would I need to install Docker inside my Docker container in order to configure Calico properly, or do I have something wrong?

Does this all sound right so far?  Please let me know if I'm on the wrong track, or let me know if you have any insight into how I should be configuring Calico.  Thanks so much!

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=Nr87jrcgtoeYdNYBd) @sorabot You do not need any complicated setup with Calico to run containers in the same network. Just create a Docker network with `docker network create iroha_net` and then attach all the containers to this network by `docker run --network iroha_net ...`

I see. There was someone here a week ago using iroha in kubernetes but he's been absent for a while. Would love to have more active members using kubernetes to deploy, so I have others to consult with if I run into problems.

Hello, I've sent a transaction to Iroha and the return status is ENOUGH_SIGNATURES_COLLECTED.
Is that correct or it should be COMMITTED?

(now via gitter) I'm confused since apparently it ran OK, without errors (as per below)
```tx_status: ENOUGH_SIGNATURES_COLLECTED

And more than that: if I force the creation of the same account "aaabbbccc" multiple times, it always return the same status. In this case I would expect to receive an error message stating that the account already exists.

I don't see the account created in Postgres. Maybe the reason is because the domain "example.com" does not exist. I'm going to investigate these possibilities and will report here.

I've tried to create a domain first. The log is here: https://pastebin.com/yg7DMVxr

Looking at the logs more closely, I've noticed that is says that it didn't pass signature validation.
However, once again, this failure is not apparent from TxStatus:
```tx_status: ENOUGH_SIGNATURES_COLLECTED

I suppose the issue is that I'm signing the transaction using a randomly generated key pair. I suppose that I should use a well known key pair relative to an administrative account. This is the test code in Scala, in case you are curious:
```scala
    "create a new domain" - {
      import iroha.protocol.endpoint.ToriiResponse
      import net.cimadai.crypto.KeyPair
      import net.cimadai.iroha.Iroha.{Account, CmdStub, Domain, QryStub, Role}

      val domainName = "example.com"
      val adminAccountName = "admin"
      val roleName = "admin"

      implicit val cmdStub: CmdStub = CommandService_v1Grpc.stub(channel)
      implicit val qryStub: QryStub = QueryService_v1Grpc.stub(channel)

      val keypair = KeyPair.random

      val admin = Account(adminAccountName, domainName)
      val domain = Domain(domainName)
      val role = Role(roleName)
      val cb = Iroha.CommandBuilder
      val tb = Iroha.TransactionBuilder
      val api = Iroha.CommandService

      val tryTask: Try[Task[ToriiResponse]] =
        for {
          a <- admin; d <- domain; r <- role; kp <- keypair
          cmd <- cb.createDomain(d, r)
          tx <- tb.transaction(a, kp, cmd)
          //TODO: checkTransactionCommit(tx)
        } yield {
          api.send(tx)(cmdStub)
        }

      val result = tryTaskNow(tryTask)
      result match {
        case Success(response) =>
          import iroha.protocol.endpoint.TxStatus
          val status = response.txStatus
          assert(status == TxStatus.COMMITTED)
        case Failure(t) => throw t
      }
    }
```

I'm now using the public key hex and private key hex from iroha-java test cases.
I think that the public key is now correct in the log: https://pastebin.com/PyT4CZXC
I guess that now the problem must be some error when signing the message.

Feedback is appreciated on https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/IR-401
My intent with this issue is allowing domain names to be truly public domain names, so that Iroha servers could be public on the Internet, even though eventually protected behing firewall or OAuth2 authentication, etc.

the language which is used to create domain names is not "regular", so there is no any single valid regex that could parse all possible valid domain names

Due to that design, a small trick is possible. When you have a lot of transactions have to be authored by 'alice@iroha' and just a couple of transactions from 'bob@iroha' you able to instantiate single Iroha('alice@iroha') and use it for bob's transactions too, just by specifying ...transaction(... , creator_account='bob@iroha') :)

Hi. You can track the history of a chain via watching manually the block store directory (can be configured in a config file before irohad launch) or use GetBlock (returns a single block) or FetchCommits (returns a stream of all committed blocks since the moment of requesting) queries (Iroha API)

There is a base for different versions (full backwards compatibility, with Iroha version mentioned in the block) but currently there is 1 Iroha version, simply being developed continuously. The older versions are kinda supposed to be updated. 
These parameters are backward compatible mostly to prevent breaking things in networks that already work. 
At least that's how I see it, maybe others have other opinions

That is useful. However we are talking about privacy and confidentiality of transactions (both data and meta-data) to parties that do not need to know or are malicious or are competitors. Defense in depth, privacy by design etc. that would be challenged in any Enterprise deployment. Maybe the solution has to be built entirely by application developers with no direct support provided by the platform. We just need to make a statement to that effect. If there are any use cases that you have built that demonstrate that we can quote that.  In fact Sawtooth has no fundamental support in the platform for privacy (In Fabric there are channels, private data objects) and thats what we state. people are layering on both those aspects on top of Sawtooth.

Hello Will. As it was expected - the library just had to be recompiled due to added GetBlock query in proto schema.
Please check that library I built manually (until our CI is not engaged, hope this happen soon).

pip uninstall iroha
pip install iroha-0.0.4.m-py3-none-any.whl

You can test the new query by adding this to tx-example.py from hyperledger/iroha-python/examples:
@trace 
def get_genesis_block():
    query = iroha.query('GetBlock', height=1)
    IrohaCrypto.sign_query(query, ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY)
    response = net.send_query(query)
    print('Genesis block:')
    print(response)

Hi! We described how to run iroha-helpers with Iroha in README.md in "Trying an example" part, also there you can find an example that can be runned. If you want to run it with Node.js you can skip stage 3.

I'm a complete noob at javascript, which is what i believe that is (doesnt even look like valid js lol) but here's essentially what needs to be done with all transactions:
You construct a protobuf transaction using a defined method (passing parameters to it such as account, amount). And then call another method upon that constructed transaction that "signs" it. This signing method, you have to provide a private key (should be the key of transaction creator) to it. And so this signed transaction is sent to the iroha network

Mind you, I do not work with js; Anyways: This technique is apparently called `function currying`. It looks like the first bracket returns calls a member function: `signWithArrayOfKeys()`, which returns another function that accepts two parameters: `txToSend` and `privateKeys`. You end up with a signed transaction in `txToSend`qinghui

See the `genesis.block` file. The examples in the repository typicallly have a user `test@test` (`<user>@<domain>`) defined in them. Notice that there is a 64 character hex key associated with the user. That is the user's public key. You should have the private key that corresponds to that public key stored in a protected area (or memorized haha)

Okay, I think I get your problem. Transaction can be rejected if user with such name and domain already created, so I think you need to make getAccount and check is user exist.

Hello. I´m new with this technology. I´m mostly interested in the architecture of the system, in order to properly know it and where to apply. I have reviewed the documentation available, but I cannot find a proper place for in-depth information about Iroha components and messages. I have a general overview, but is there any place where I can find more details? Is there any proposed production-like infrastructure (distribution of components, etc.) that could be used at least as a reference?
In addtion to that, I read somewhere that the Ordering Service was a single point of failure, thus node-leve high availability measures where required. Is it right? 
Thanks!

Why does it not return a proper error code `4` https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/commands.html#id20

That would've saved this guy hours of searching and waiting for a solution. So if other transactions don't work, one must manually check for the possible validation errors?

The python library has a function that calculates the hash of a proto transaction.
I simply call that function before I send the transaction.

Hi! For example like in our setup script (https://github.com/soramitsu/iroha-wallet-js/blob/master/scripts/setup-accounts-and-assets.js#L199), you can use `try\catch` or promises to handle success or unsuccess response
</p>

What do you expect from the command? If you want to handle the response from this function is it success or no, just uses promises or async\await.

some-postgres is a hostname of docker container that should be in the same network as your iroha network. Most likely you will need to add both "some-postgres" and "iroha" containers to the same network. It is as easy as `docker network create iroha-network` and then you need to pass  `--network=iroha-network` argument to your docker run commands. Make sure that "some-postgres" is running. To do so simply check logs from the container with `docker logs some-postgres`

If you encounter any problems please tell us here.
Just a hint: you don't need to build iroha in order to run it. Use hyperledger/iroha:latest image. There is a sample command in iroha docs, however the docs might be stale — don't hesitate to ask for help :)

I have no way to "prove" they aren't being correctly calculated except demonstrate my code: sending transactions and then checking their status using the calculated hash —> `"failed to execute query: At least one of the supplied hashes is incorrect"`

i believe when one calls the functions which calculates the hashes for a transaction, talking about the python library, it returns a malformed hash, which does not get accepted by the network when performing queries.
if you use the python library, you should have ran across similar issues when performing queries like "GetTransaction" or any other query command that requires hashes to carry out that transaction.

Sorry for raising a false alarm, I have seen now that the problem was caused by me:

`binascii.hexlify(IrohaCrypto.hash(signed_transaction))`
would return something like:
`b'73efd5f01c225f842a5b9d691db7e6c0b4329f2785c204105fdc7e72e66896dd'`

... and I forgot to `.decode('utf-8')`. Instead I would use like `73efd5f01c225f842a5b9d691db7e6c0b4329f2785c204105fdc7e72e66896dd` 🤦‍♂️ 🤦‍♂️ How silly of me.

I guess problem can be in Promise.all, becase If any of the passed-in promises reject, Promise.all will return value of rejected function. Maybe better to rewrite it and run in sequence - https://pastebin.com/wz23bxe4

The reason to do it is that function appendRole is called earlier then createAccount and it can cause the error.

As Igor explained, a public key has a  private key it is linked to. Therefore if you generate a new key pair to use, save the private key somewhere, because iroha requires it, to let you create transactions or queries using that account.

I dont know how grpc works; when i do `IrohaGrpc('localhost')` does that initiate any sort of connection at that point or it just sets up the connection attributes or something?

At the moment I'm thinking the only time a connection is made is when `.send_tx()` or `.send_query()` and then immediately closed after response is r eceived.

Yes. There are 2 types of validation - stateless and stateful. When you send any transaction and get immediate response, you got answer from "stateless validation".

Hey guys, I have a question about customizability:

Iroha has standard Account, Asset etc. structures that it accommodates, but how would one introduce a different kind of structure to the ecosystem?

For example, say I need to represent an “Order” where the destination is known, the asset is known, the amount is known, but the source of this asset is not yet known (e.g. waiting for someone to sell the asset in the amount required). This would be a malformed Transaction, so I would need another structure to describe it.

What is the recommended way of achieving this kind of customizability using Iroha?

Hello guys! I have upgraded my iroha network to the `latest` docker image which probably corresponds `RC5`. I upgraded from RC2 to RC5. I had to change my Python APIs as well. However, before upgradation: I was having `NOT_RECEIVED` status for all my transactions from all other nodes. (Node to which I send the original tx shows `ENOUGH_SIGNATURES_COLLECTED`. This goes on forever and the transaction never committed.

Even after upgrading to RC5 the issue is persistent. I have checked my nodes and both ports are exposed `50051` and `10001`. Dont know why this is happening

`
pip install iroha==0.0.5.dev1`

```
Please check if it works. If the issue is still there, please let me know

I dont think its the issue with PythonLib. As in the logs of my other nodes: when I check for status of a tx: it says following:

`[2019-04-16 13:02:52.471390372][W][Irohad/CommandService]: Asked non-existing tx: 48d461a001bcbae10396155e66f59d2f5358ee10334d6dc22be71f1ee8da60f0`
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 16 Apr 2019 13:26:21 GMT):<br/>
*Yasir* _via telegram_
which means python did the job by sending the transaction to one node and then asked for status from another node.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 16 Apr 2019 13:26:47 GMT):<br/>

I think transactions are not being sent from one node to any other... There is some communication issue between nodes.

</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 16 Apr 2019 13:27:17 GMT):<br/>

Yes. Because the transaction is not going across nodes at all.

Hi! What do you mean by restarting the network? I already have initiated all nodes again when I upgraded my docker container to rc5. I am using my old blocks from rc2, deleted the container and created new nodes with rc5 and used the old blocks as I heard it supports backwards compatibility...

Postgres servers are running as before. No change made to those.

1. Hyperledger (iroha i.e.) couldbe used to create such exchange and tools for cross exchange with other digital assests owners or exchsnges. But, notice that many crypto projects have very complicated integration with outer world. Standartization is yet not come. Tiny effirt was ethereum, but fees declined this project and no real bavking of assests made world of crypto a 99% world of digitalnumizmats. Buying power for existing crypto is extremely low due to scarce places where to spend. And even in case a customer pays in crypto - almost always transaction is nominated in fiat or instant conversion to fiat takes place. No digital assets backed by blocks is accepted by it is own value. The exception is darkweb and scam projects, like ico, presales and masked mlm

Hi! I have a probrem.
I have checked queries and transactions from Python3 to Iroha, but I am getting confused with GetAccountTransactions, which is a little puzzled.

1st:
  GetAccountTransactions query without first_tx_hash.
Continuation:
  GetAccountTransactions query with previous response next_tx_hash.
Finish:
  GetAccountTransactions response have no next_tx_hash.

Probrem:
  For example the account to be verified currently has 21 transactions.
  In the case of the above program, it was assumed that 10, 10 and 1 on from the first transaction are output in order, but actually there was a missing or duplicate, and it was output as 10, 10 and 8.
  In case it is specified 21 for page_size to get all in the correct order.
  Also, if page_size is set to 1, next_tx_hash will return the same value every time, resulting in an infinite loop.

Is my usage bad?
I would appreciate your advice if there are any notices.

The version used is below.

It is ok. Could you please start from the scratch with the same design of the genesis block and the scenario to get a non-private sample of block store? (without any sensitive names, just with asset1, asset2, user1, user2, etc)

What they are basically doing is preparing the possibility of adding C++ blockchains to Polkadot. There are no more precise plans anymore at the moment, but the plan is kept in mind. Btw, I believe that EOS is more like a public blockchain, isn't it?

Hello friends, I am following the getting started guide. I set up the iroha server, and used iroha_cli to create a new asset, add asset quantity, and transfer assets, exactly as per the documentation.

After sending the transaction to the peer, when I query its status, it is always showing "Transaction has collected all signatures".

If I query the account's assets, I get just the headers.

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

Hi everyone, as I understand, Iroha is more geared to fungible assets, but is there any way to do non-fungible as well?
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 15:44:58 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=SXwtbryj7CsH8nPmm) @nhhntr Hi! There are several commands and queries like SetAccountDetail or GetAccoutDetail. By using it you can write almost any parameter to an account. 
</p>
<p><strong>bregg</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 15:46:07 GMT):<br/>
@SaraG , Thanks! So basically instead of the NFTs being assets, they're be accounts instead, or am I misinterpreting?
</p>
<p><strong>igor-egorov</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 17:44:16 GMT):<br/>
Hi @bregg, Iroha allows storing of random data in a key-value format as account meta (account details). Thus, it is possible to handle any data, even NFTs in account details storage. Currently, Iroha does not define a set of operators and primitives for NFTs.

Hello, @igor_egorov

I'm trying to determine how I would tie my application releases (bundling a particular version of the python client) with corresponding Iroha network versions in my backend.

At the moment I suppose I can expect full compatibility with the current python client and Iroha 1.x.x, correct?

Moving forward, can I also expect the API reference not to change for major version 1.x.x?

How will future releases of the python client coincide (if at all) with major/minor/patch releases of Iroha?

📮 Друзья, поздравляем вас с прошедшими праздниками!

Многие из нас успели отметить их самоотверженным трудом во имя децентрализации. Особенно те, кто трудится вдалеке от отчизны. Как мы частенько шутим - в любом глобальном блокчейн-проекте есть разработчик из Петербурга. А чтобы не лишать таких участников общения с нами, мы решили, что новый сезон наших митапов будет проходить частично или полностью онлайн.

Мы неоднократно использовали такой формат в наших прежних встречах, и оказалось, что он очень востребован. Записи прошедших митапов вы можете увидеть здесь: https://youtube.com/SPbBlockChainCommunity
Теперь мы будем чаще пополнять нашу видеоколлекцию не только записями докладов, но и прямыми трансляциями и учебными роликами.

👉 Сегодня же приглашаем вас к участию в очередной онлайн-встрече, которая пройдёт 23 мая в 17:30 МСК. Ссылку на страницу конференции мы опубликуем позже.

Hi @blockchain-Bobby ! That sounds great, looking forward to your updates! However I would look at the mentioned cli repository as a single source of truth - for example here https://github.com/MizukiSonoko/iroha-cli/blob/master/iroha_cli/commands.py the command types are hardcoded, which is hard to maintain. Please look at protobuf reflection to implement command types.

Be advised that Iroha requires around 2-2.5 GB of RAM to build it using a single compiler tread (-j1). RPi 3 has just 1GB of RAM AFAIK. We tried building on armv7l instances with 2GB of RAM previously but failed due to memory limitations

Hello Masaki,  I want to thank you again for you effort with collecting a sample blockstore!

The first reported problem (10+10+8 != 21) was confirmed and the pull request with the fix is already submitted https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/77

I was not able to reproduce the second issue - iterating by one transaction could be successfully performed and no infinite loop occurred. Please check the example from the gist - https://gist.github.com/igor-egorov/1a2c13f69baab8c9ff4c338fc26768df.

Additionally, I am glad to announce the tool I created for the problem reproducing. The tool that regenerates a blockstore with an initially unknown set of used private keys - https://github.com/igor-egorov/reblockstorer. It will be uploaded to Pypi repository soon.

So if user A creates a transaction with quorum 2 that requires another signatory e.g. transfer quantity 10 of asset coin#test

All I need to do is create another transaction with the creator as the other signatory of user account A which also transfers quantity 10 of asset coin#test?

<p><strong>blockchain-Bobby</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 13:38:16 GMT):<br/>
Are you referring to composer's as a Rest API / Web UI or the "setup your network part" of it? as for Iroha the same can be achieved in a less complex manner , I am far from a great software developer but my enthusiasm and creativity is what lead me to some interesting ideas.  @ Makoto does it have to be integrated with the current hyperledger composer? It would help with adoption I suppose but I have got an alternative method that falls more inline with the official docs provided by iroha on how to setup a network.  
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 14:12:12 GMT):<br/>
*[B V](https://t.me/bv_o0)* _via telegram_
it should not necessarily be integrated with existing composer. 
composer is rather a good example of easy-to-use in-browser sandbox, so you don't need to do all those complex admin/devops stuff for fabric (in our case for Iroha).

it is possible to implement similar sandbox for Iroha. 
- server part should run iroha peers with given genesis blocks (easiest way is to use testcontainers https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-java/tree/master/testcontainers/)
- frontend will let user to 
(1) specify a genesis block and config parameters, 
(2) implement some logic using javascript, 
(3) "package" this logic into an app, that can be used easily to expose REST API over your logic
</p>

Hello, I searched everywhere but couldn't find a certain answer so I have to ask here, sorry if the answer is somewhere else.

Supply chains are one. We are building a system right now for medical info like allergies medications and stuff like that to be written to a chip that will interact with mobile devices. (More leaning towards first responders)  basically show up to a scene see sticker on front windshield and know person has chip on their key ring. Scan that and you have their info to identify them and everything even if incapacitated.

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sun, 09 Jun 2019 10:53:48 GMT):<br/>
*[B V](https://t.me/bv_o0)* _via telegram_
your best option is to hash your document, and store hash in iroha. then, you verify integrity by hashing document and looking for one on blockchain.

it is feasible to store the whole document, but it is likely that your blockchain will grow significantly (as each peer stores full copy of blockchain)

you can delete digital signature, but proof stored on blockchain can not be deleted

<p><strong>blockchain-Bobby</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 08:35:06 GMT):<br/>
For adding in files, look at IPFS, and store the hash there/IPFS file location. Note that IPFS does note encrypt any files so it will be accessible if you do not configure your nodes accordingly, but most of the stuff you were asking about @ Udit is why it exists in the fist place, as well as the sharding of files. This is how Raven coin (and alot of other people)makes use of a decentralized storage system. This is also how I am personally dealing with file / document storage . https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/usage/ be creative and use both Iroha and this and you might not have to revent the wheel
</p>
<p><strong>blockchain-Bobby</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 08:54:17 GMT):<br/>
@ Punlea, depends on your node config, also note that its note that gPRC is HTTP 2.0 connection, so do not try to make it talk over a normal http channel as it simply wont work :grinning:. Also I cannot confirm for the JavaScript side of things as I could not get my JS implementations to communicate over gRPC(me being a dumbass) but my python things work 100%.

Hello! What kind of info are you interested in? Blocks contain committed transactions and hashes of rejected transactions. To retrieve such info you should get Block.Block_v1.Payload

Ok. I have a random question for anyone. Let's say I start an Iroha network with 3 nodes on one remote host and run a few transactions so the blockchain has some data in it. How do I "add a node" to the existing network from a different remote host? With bitcoin, the 4th node first downloads the entire blockchain of the existing network and then plugs in. With Iroha, I haven't found how.

It made progress!!! So I'm running a simple example first. I start one Iroha node. I run a couple transactions through it's admin account. I start another Iroha node with the same genesis block. I run AddPeer using an admin on the first node. I use the docker IP of the second node and port 10000. The second node adds. I see it downloads the new blocks. Then the second node gets stuck in a loop of 

[2019-06-17 20:18:08.407218815][I][Irohad/Validators/Chain]: validate chain...
[2019-06-17 20:18:08.407794491][I][Irohad/FlatFileBlockFactory]: Remove /tmp/2fe3-511a-fa03-feea temp directory

The genesis block of both nodes contains 

                       {
                          "addPeer":{
                             "peer":{
                                "address":"127.0.0.1:10001",
                                "peerKey":"bddd58404d1315e0eb27902c5d7c8eb0602c16238f005773df406bc191308929"
                             }
                          }
                       },

I don't know if the problem is because I'm using localhost in the genesis block and then docker IP in the 2nd node. No clue what's causing the new puzzle

I am back. All the nodes should have the same genesis block. Thus, all the peers of the initial network configuration have to be mentioned in a single genesis block via AddPeer commands. 

Additional peers can be added later: just launch one more node with the same genesis block as before (it would not contain any info about the peer you are going to add to the network), then send AddPeer command with new peer's address and public key to one of the peers from the existing network.

It says how to run several iroha nodes in docker within a single network.

The only change for the guide is: you have to specify one more line in postgres containers' creation commands

Question. In your example, when you run "iroha-cli" how are you running it before you had an iroha daemon up and running? Isn't the irohad a pre-req to running iroha-cli or can it run stand alone? See below

We need to create nodes' keypairs, genesis block via composing peers.list and passing it to iroha-cli:

$ cat peers.list
172.19.0.4:10001
172.19.0.5:10001 

$ iroha-cli --genesis_block --peers_address peers.list

For genesis block generation iroha-cli can be launched independently from irohad state. Because it doesn’t interact directly with irohad in this case

Generally speaking, there are the same conceptual restrictions as for the bitcoin blockchain. You can do prune the story preserving actual state of a ledger, but the precise story will remain in an archive. Formally, after the prune you will work with the new network - all the peers have to be restarted, but all the peers’ and users’ keys will remain valid.

Dang. Spent all day on this but no success. I walked through your tutorial and created a 2 node local network. I ran a few transactions. They were synced. I created a 3rd node with the same genesis block. Gave it keys. Then I used the python API to call AddPeer. See Attached files.

The .sh file contains roughly the steps I took and the iroha log  for all 3 nodes before they stalled

@B V already got my own way thanks and using Python, Click + Argparser modules. Also I prefer not working with the JS module. Extra gRPC stuff is unnecessary in my iteration if its purely a CLi that needs to interact with irohad. With python you just install the requirements and it works, no extra stuff to run so not just my preference. here is click, https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/

<p><strong>blockchain-Bobby</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 12:48:48 GMT):<br/>
trying to emulate the current Menu's and Options as what I built was a proof of concept for my projects that i decided to first do a full iroha based version(all of the possible features not just limitations to our uses cases). Using a bit of protobuf stuff to parse the stuff back to JSON. also want to add the option to save stuff to JSON files like on the current CLI. So w.r.t Progress it does work and one can expand quickly on it it is simply not at the current coding standard to be contributed and need to add the error catching logic in to. Hence always checking in with @lebdron  and @igor-egorov for guidance as I want to get it right the 1st time.

How can I save the private-public key pair using Iroha and be able to retrieve them in next session without having to regenerate everything?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 22:23:56 GMT):<br/>

I'm just a newbie. But the way I did this was create a docker container with Iroha and use the iroha-cli

./iroha-cli --account_name newuser@test --new_account

once this command generated a pub and priv file, I moved files out of the docker container with

docker cp iroha_container:root/newuser@test.pub ~/localfolder

You can also build the iroha-cli as a standalone executable in a dev environment https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/build.html

Once the dev iroha container is built, you can generate as many keys/genesis blocks as you want

Are you looking to store the keys to a file? as I dont see the part where your 'doing' anything with the dict. also Do you perhaps want to store the keys in a single dictionary? i have done both.

@SaraG I definetly will require some feedback input in reviewing the code. I asked @lebdron  and @igor-egorov already and they've said theyll gladly review it. I tried splitting the commands & queries and added a utils file, currently it prints and returns the tx status results and the tx_hex. since each response from a query side differs due to the fields provided in the protobuf reflection of the messages, I am compiling that to a new list that gets printed(in the cli) or you can use the returned list to process it using normal python functions

<p><strong>kn3118</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 11:08:02 GMT):<br/>
I was wondering if there is an identity manager in Iroha that does this for you? 

Storing the keys to a file that I have access to, gives me excess power and control over the network (which you don't really want in a decentralised environment, that's why we are using blockchain -even though private- in the first place, right?). So is that a good solution?

The problem that I am experiencing is that when I run the deamon and overwrite the ledger everything works fine and I can sign transactions with the stored private keys. However, when I want to run a transaction again and I rerun part of the code, the details get lost (mappings in the dictionary), so I get an error message saying that this key does not exist in my dictionary and so I cannot sign transactions with these keys anymore. Therefore, I realised that I need a more global and persistent storage of data (key pairs).
Any idea how to deal with that??

Many thanks for replying to my message in the first place!!
</p>
<p><strong>blockchain-Bobby</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 11:37:30 GMT):<br/>
I simply encrypted the keypairs . created a "wallet" file which is a json file then encrypt it accordingly. Also from the snippet I can read from your code is your storing into 2 seperate varialables, not even the same and i do not see your initializing a dict / {} nor list []. Remember your code as is stores only for the duration of the scripts excecution
</p>
<p><strong>blockchain-Bobby</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 11:39:17 GMT):<br/>
also bear in mind the keys are bytes and not normal string, so depending on how you work data around, you might get errors when trying to call the value and the length differs as it now adds the b'' in-front of the keys to, 
</p>
<p><strong>blockchain-Bobby</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 11:41:30 GMT):<br/>
how you store your keys is up to your use case. I come from a cryptocurrency so storing keys  in files and encrypting them is nothing new. its the standard practice. Just bear in mind that how  you store you keys will greatly affect wheere and how you can use them e.g. Unless you use the .priv .pub separate file storage method then you won't be able to use it woth the current Iroha-CLI. will work in your code ofcourse
</p>
<p><strong>kn3118</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 11:55:42 GMT):<br/>
yes, I actually initialise the dictionaries in the beginning of the script, and as you said there is no need for having 2 separate dicts, so I will refactor this part into 1 dict instead.

Okay, I will try to encrypt the keypairs and store them into a json file. I have not done this before (encrypting/decrypting keys, storing them in a different file and then accessing them) so I guess it will be a bit challenging in the beginning (but also fascinating).

Thanks for your advice!!

Does Iroha currently provides a framework which supports smart-contract development?
For example, after creating an asset I want to specify some characteristics for this particular asset that then users-owners of the asset will be completing and editing.
</p>
<p><strong>blockchain-Bobby</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 13:30:09 GMT):<br/>
I am not 100% sure about the fields currently available for asset creation, but your question does not particulary relate to a smart contract. I also needed to be able to update asset details / providing a description for end users and one way was to create an "asset oracle / account"  in python code(note smart contract) I combined the creation of an asset, with setAccountDetails, and used the assetid(asset#domain) as the key and in the value field provided a json/dictonary with the required paramaters. you could then add a field that stores say and IPFS hash too. then upon user account creation on your chain. everyone is able to read from that account

Hi all, Im trying to access my postgres db from the iroha js example https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-javascript. However, when i run the command 'docker exec -it some-postgres docker-entrypoint.sh' it doesnt take me into the DB interactive environment and neither does it show me any errors. Am I missing something on how to see what I have stored in the DB?

Hi. Iroha uses postgres internally and it is not designed to be accessed directly by a user in our case. If you still want to check the db contents, for example, you may use pgAdmin or any other pg db browser.

@lebdron Just wanna ask something, I am updaing my fork of the repo so saw this https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/master/irohad/ametsuchi/impl/postgres_block_storage.cpp   Safe to assume that the blocks no longer stored in a flatfile?

is there best practice to manage same key-value pair in account detail of "Account A" using two different accounts ("Account B" and "Account C"?
If I use set account detail command using two different accounts, then detail of "Account A" contains two dicts for two writers. Of course I can iterate over each writer and get corresponding values, but how should I know which value is latest?

I have a use case as follows: A user makes predictions on an on-going basis and uploads them to Iroha (or a similar chain). Other users can then verify the predictions with a time delay. There are multiple prediction makers, and prediction readers. I want the prediction readers to be able to verify that the chain is indeed immutable and the timestamps associated with predictions are correct. Would Iroha support such a use case or is there a better solution for my case?

I am trying to use the 'GetTransactions' from the Python library, but I keep getting wrong results (or errors). I provide as an argument the hash of a transaction that has already taken place (by checking irohad and copy pasting the transaction hash). Can anyone help with this query?
Here is my code for this function:

@trace
def get_transaction_details(_hash):
    '''
    List of all details of the transactions with the provided hashes. _hash can be a list of hashes
    '''
        print(
        net.send_query(

                iroha.query('GetTransactions', tx_hashes=_hash,
                            creator_account='john@system'),
                'c312814497f83b8be765d70dcf448d5622cd7aa2469237ecec7b8a98c9158a4b'
            )
        )
    ) 

and I call it like that:
get_transaction_details('1f6fab8ad7c00e3af1a1c53a252a0ba7234f3dfd19374b72d958a5a62f286f95')

Hello folks.  I am new testing iroha, so I am creating a quick prototype for android using iroha-java client.
(https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-java)

I am including it by adding this line in gradel.build
*
i*mplementation "com.github.hyperledger.iroha-java:client:master-SNAPSHOT"
(Snapshot seems same as https://jitpack.io/#hyperledger/iroha-java/5.2.0)

then debugging in an old android API 22 since prototype needs supporting `minSdkVersion 16` to `targetSdkVersion 28`

I am doing an instance of client API as follow

`IrohaAPI` *api *`=` *new *`IrohaAPI(`*"*correct.dev.ip.here.*"*`, 50051);`

but I am getting next error 

*ClassNotFoundException: java.time.Instant*

So reviewing  INSTANT time class for Android it says was Added in API level 26

So, Just wondering if iroja-java client is supposed to work only in almost latest android api version and if there is another aproach to use iroha-java to support older API versions

Thank you very much for all your help.
Erick

I changed to

the latter uses an `Instant.`_now_`()` inside

These are just signal handlers for "graceful shutdown". This means, once you press Ctrl+C or your OS is shutting down, it will send iroha SIGINT or SIGTERM, for which the provided handler will take care of. AFAIK none of these signals are sent by iroha itself.

Do you mean that you get one of these signals after you send an AddPeer command?

So how would you personally run the AddPeer function? I find that it only works if all peer adresses are originally in the genesis block. Has anyone attempted to run AddPeer adding a brand new node to an existing network and confirmed that it works? 

If you add a new node to an existing network (using that networks genesis block) and then check the new node's postgres, you'll see that it doesn't include it's own adress. I suspect this is why it keeps stalling.

I am back. All the nodes should have the same genesis block. Thus, all the peers of the initial network configuration have to be mentioned in a single genesis block via AddPeer commands. 

Additional peers can be added later: just launch one more node with the same genesis block as before (it would not contain any info about the peer you are going to add to the network), then send AddPeer command with new peer's address and public key to one of the peers from the existing network.

Thank you. I just ran this test manually (using docker and irohad) and the first node log failed at "rpc connect failed" and the second node log failed at "Proposal". 

My steps were 1) create and run an iroha node 2) run AddPeer on that node 3) create an run the new iroha node, 4) both logs stop producing output

Different variants of these steps will fail differently. For example

1) Create an run an iroha node then 2) run a transaction on the node 3) create and run a 2nd node, 4) run AddPeer with the first node, 5) the peer address successfully commits to the first node and 6) the logs for both nodes (after a brief flurry of activity) stall and stop producing new output indefinitely

1) if you have 2 signatories (after having added 1 signatorie to your account) and quorum 1, does that mean that any of the 2 signing a transaction will validate the transaction?

2) if a user has can_get_all... of something then they also automatically have can_get_my... and can_get_domain... ? Is the can_get_all... a superset of can_get_my... and can_get_domain... ?

it is the expected behavior of an idle system. we thought of renaming the reject counter to something more neutral, but didn't come up with a good idea. what you see is just agreement on nothing to commit.

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 13:14:13 GMT):<br/>
*[Mikhail Boldyrev](https://t.me/mboldyrev)* _via telegram_
each round we use some peer as an ordering service. in order to tolerate failures, we need to pass ordering service role to different peers in a deterministic manneer. this counter is one of the parameters that determines current ordering service.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 13:18:43 GMT):<br/>
*Kostas Ntolkeras* _via telegram_
I guess this has to do with YAC mechanism which is Byzantine-fault tolerant. So how does this work, do you pass ordering service role to all peers in the network in a deterministic manner?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 13:22:25 GMT):<br/>
*[Mikhail Boldyrev](https://t.me/mboldyrev)* _via telegram_
the ordering service role carrier is decided by mixing hashes of 2 last committed blocks and the reject counter, so every peer with an up-to-date network info can see, which peer is the ordering right now
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 13:28:49 GMT):<br/>
*Kostas Ntolkeras* _via telegram_
not entirely sure what you mean Mikhail. To my understanding, the 2 last committed blocks contain transaction hashes, and the reject counter is a counter, so how can by mixing (transaction) hashes in the 2 last committed blocks and the reject counter everyone with an up-to-date network info see which peer is the orderer now?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 13:31:17 GMT):<br/>
*[Mikhail Boldyrev](https://t.me/mboldyrev)* _via telegram_
blocks also have hashes, this is common in blockchains. so we can use them as a seed for a pseudo-random number generator that will produce equivalent sequences on any node, provided that block hashes are the same. the reject counter is used to pick a number from that sequence, and then it is mapped to the ordered list of peers in the network.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 13:34:24 GMT):<br/>
*Kostas Ntolkeras* _via telegram_
oh okay now it's more clear to me. And how does the reject counter pick a number from that sequence?

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 13:35:13 GMT):<br/>
*[Mikhail Boldyrev](https://t.me/mboldyrev)* _via telegram_
if I recall right, it is just the serial number from the beginning of the sequence =)

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 13:35:54 GMT):<br/>
*[Mikhail Boldyrev](https://t.me/mboldyrev)* _via telegram_
so every time the round switches without a commit, the next number from the pseudo-random sequence is used
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 13:38:49 GMT):<br/>
*Kostas Ntolkeras* _via telegram_
so this next number from the pseudo-random sequence mapped to the ordered list of peers in the network would define which peer is the orderer this time?

I have a usecase where shipping companies have a lot of containers. One company may need to grant read access about the container. Each company have it's own domain.
Currently I restrict read access on backend side, but it will be great if the blockchain could do the trick.

Probably if I change the structure of domains then can_het_domain_acc_detail could do the trick.

Thanks for help

About iroha-Pi, I could not find any guide apart from the Readme on the github suggested by Sara.

I have successfully run the Irohad on armv7l device (the equivalent of raspi3).
Please follow the guide that I composed and tested: https://gist.github.com/igor-egorov/356f1d34207755a2dfe0b401440224e1

Please note that the image provided by dmitriyselivanov doesn't contain the latest build of Iroha. Moreover, there are some hardcoded constants (e.g. Postgres host, etc).

Better to build the image on your own for the long term perspective, because we even cannot see the dockerfile used for image build and we cannot see the sources used to compile irohad which is inside the container.

Despite everything, many thanks to @sea1and for providing the image with an Iroha for armv7l!

If possible, please let me know the modification of Dockerfile.

Yes, when building Iroha, you need to add SWAP. 
It takes about 3 hours to fully build even the mSD only RPI 3B +.

With that repository, Iroha can be built just by execute only make and run on Linux/x86_64, Darwin/x86_64, Linux/armv7l, and Linux/aarch64.

I was running my network locally and I got this message.
1) I was wondering what can cause a Transaction to Not Be Received?
2) These transactions were organised as an atomic batch. How can the first 2 Transactions Not Be Received, and the last one to get Committed ?

What is the way you created that batch? Actually, after changing the batch meta a hash of a transaction gets changed as well. My thoughts are just about incorrect hashes for first two transactions. Could you share more details please?

I am using the Iroha-Python library to interact with the network. In this example, I am defining 3 transactions (admin_tx, anm_tx, user_tx) and within each transaction I am using some commands from the Iroha-Python lib to interact with the network. After defining the transactions I do what can be seen in the photo.

there has not been any problem with the function before. I just stried to run the function 150 times in a loop, to check how much time it takes to run and after the 82 iterations I faced this issue. However, I ran the experiement again and I did not face this issue again. So it hust happended once and I was wondering what caused it and what was happening with the atomic batch of transactions (Committed vs Not Received). However, even if it just happened once surely you don't want this to happen in production

the issue is that your OS has gtest installed (maybe old, maybe new), iroha finds it, and accepts it (there is no version specified)

1. delete system-wide gtest. iroha will download required version
2. go to Findgtest.cmake and make sure `if(NOT gtest_FOUND)` (or smth like that) branch is taken. it forces iroha to download gtest
3. install correct version of gtest

Yes, hunter is not a recommended package manager, since it moves dependency management to build system, while these two tasks are independent, as it is done for example with pip in python. https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/bsjr6r/how_to_nonintrusively_try_the_conan_package/eoo2uhu/ shows the issues with hunter and conan. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k99_qbB2FvM is one of the latest talks on package management.

I think there's not much danger in that - LF guys have a great security team and I don't think  there are too many things that could be leaked since Hyperledger is already open source and all of the work is already out there. And only atlassian software could be changed with that bill, if I got it right, not the software that is being worked on with it. 
I think there should be a security group we could find if you have any concerns

Based on the numbers in https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/iroha/message/106 that means an Iroha 50-node network can handle 43.1 transactions per second. I assume that the 10 physical servers were geographically close together so this represents near ideal network conditions (no latency and low packet loss, etc.)?

One other question for @lebdron: in this perf test, the number of clients was the same as the number of nodes? In a scale up/scale out scenario, would the iroha client - server interaction scale with client growth or is this a possible bottleneck as well? (That is, the case where there are 10,000 android clients and a 10-node iroha network. Does the server start preventing clients from submitting transactions because it can’t cope with the connections.)

📮 Безопасность Данных в Сетях с Шардингом

Следующий докладчик на XXII митапе Сообщества блокчейн-разработчиков Санкт-Петербурга - Дмитрий Куринский, CTO в Fluence Labs

В этом докладе мы  подробнее рассмотрим гибридный подход и разберёмся, как сделать работу  классической базы данных (Redis или SQLite) в децентрализованной сети  сравнимой по цене с централизованным облаком, не жертвуя при этом  безопасностью.

Напоминаем, что Двадцать второй митап Сообщества блокчейн-разработчиков Санкт-Петербурга пройдёт онлайн *31 июля с 19:00 до 22:00 (МСК)*. 
Ссылку на страницу онлайн-митапа мы сообщим позже.

Hi, in order to have N nodes in your network, you have to create N keypairs and modify your genesis block - to add N times AddPeer command with the addresses and public keys for nodes. Moreover, you can use single postgres for all the nodes, just add to pgopt config parameter different dbname=irohadbN for each node. Ports and blockstore path should also be different.

Напоминаем, что митап пройдёт *онлайн*, поэтому никуда ехать не надо 😁 Надо оставаться за компьютером, не забыв прихватить бокальчик кофе, потому что потом будет уже не отвлечься 👀

Сбор участников начинается в 18:30. 
Первый доклад - в 19:00.
Пожалуйста, подключитесь заранее, чтобы проверить работу своих аудио/видео устройств, и сюрпризы не настигли вас в самом разгаре вебинара.

Hi. I am using Python library to interact with my 4 node network. Occasionally I am getting this error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/srv/main.py", line 38, in gett_status
    status, s_code , error_code = net.tx_status(tx_hash)
  File "/srv/static/iroha.py", line 364, in tx_status
    response = self._command_service_stub.Status(request)
  File "/env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/grpc/_channel.py", line 562, in _call_
    return _end_unary_response_blocking(state, call, False, None)

    raise _Rendezvous(state, None, None, deadline)
grpc._channel._Rendezvous: <_Rendezvous of RPC that terminated with:

Can someone tell me what's causing this?

Hello, I'm a newbie looking over the following example file for Iroha https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python/blob/master/examples/tx-example.py.

In regards to just getting familiar with the code, I simply tried getting an account without creating one and it returned the following:
 Entering "get_account_details"
Account id = "account_which_doesnt_exist@domain.com ", details =
 Leaving "get_account_details"

Does the example code automatically create an account if it's not seen within the network? Shouldnt it return an error saying "account doesnt exist?" or something like that? Or is there something eles I am missing.

*[Igor Egorov](https://t.me/igor_egorov)* _via telegram_
Hi, the file you referenced does not contain "get_account_details" method. Did you mean "get_userone_details" ?

Anyway, the script can do only the things you have coded. If you are trying to access details of a non-existing account, then nobody will create that account for you. Keep in mind that iroha preserves the ledger state when you are restarting just python script. Thus, without restarting irohad with --overwrite-ledger your script output may vary between relaunches. It depends on what commands were sent to the ledger.

Hi I'm a newbie here. I'm doing some scaleability testing with iroha (increasing the number of nodes) using docker containers. I'm always running into the issue that at around 30 nodes the consensus seems stop working properly i.e. consensus finding takes up to 10 seconds or even fail completely. Any ideas why this is happening?

Hi @dltuser12 ! There is an issue that the ordering service might send different proposals to different nodes in the network, and this might cause consensus deadlocks. This issue will be resolved in https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/95

Sorry, I seem to have missed this. Currently there is no limit for accepting transaction from the clients. This is a known issue. Current MST component design does not allow to handle this in a simple way, so there will be a fix after the MST component is refactored.

It is pretty simple to do this in iroha by calling https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/commands.html#create-asset and then increasing the quantity as needed to sell https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/commands.html#add-asset-quantity

​​Cloud Native Go: Building Web Applications and Microservices for the Cloud with Go and React (2017)
Автор: Kevin Hoffman, Dan Nemeth

#golang #book #english

Язык: английский.

Целевая аудитория: опытные разработчики на Go.

Сегодня ситуация такая, что ваше приложение либо может остаться вообще без пользователей, либо же обрабатывать передаваемые ими огромные массивы данных. Это руководство научит вас, как создавать веб-приложения на Go с использованием микросервисной архитектуры и облачных технологий. Если вы уже знакомы с основами разработки на Go, вам будет достаточно применить свои знания, чтобы создавать современные приложения в стеке Go и React.

В книге рассматриваются следующие темы: 
✔ создание микросервисов на Go;
✔ работа с сервисом данных;
✔ безопасность приложений в облаке;
✔ работаем с веб-сокетами;
✔ создаём фронтенд-часть приложения с помощью React;
✔ советы и многое другое.

Преимущества: 
➕ актуальный материал по теме;
➕ многочисленные примеры.

Недостатки: 
➖ несмотря на заявленное название, книга мало раскрывает про работу микросервисов.

Hi @giuzero, after testing, I think what you did is correct, the only issue is here: "ERROR: no matching manifest for linux/arm/v7 in the manifest list entries", when pulling Iroha image, maybe Raspbian architecture is not supported... I stand to be corrected

I have successfully run the Irohad on armv7l device (the equivalent of raspi3).
Please follow the guide that I composed and tested: https://gist.github.com/igor-egorov/356f1d34207755a2dfe0b401440224e1

Please note that the image provided by dmitriyselivanov doesn't contain the latest build of Iroha. Moreover, there are some hardcoded constants (e.g. Postgres host, etc).

Better to build the image on your own for the long term perspective, because we even cannot see the dockerfile used for image build and we cannot see the sources used to compile irohad which is inside the container.

Despite everything, many thanks to @sea1and for providing the image with an Iroha for armv7l!

Permissions are being set within admin account and I am not sure if it's directly connected to the private keys. Summoning @lebdron

why should anyone send private keys?
</p>
<p><strong>lebdron</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 13:24:28 GMT):<br/>
@Shubham-koli you should send the query from the created account in that case. `creatorAccountId` would be `shubham@test` in your example, and `privateKey` should correspond to the public key that you used with `createAccount` command
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 13:25:13 GMT):<br/>
*[Andrei Lebedev](https://t.me/lebdron)* _via telegram_
@mboldyrev It looks like the API from example uses private key to sign the query
</p>
<p><strong>Shubham-koli</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 13:27:06 GMT):<br/>
yes.  Andrei is right.
I tried to use the user's  key but it doesn't work. gives some kind of error.

in createAccount command, the only key you specify is the new account public key. the command itself is signed with the command creator's key which is the admin's key in your case. obviously admin should know his private key.
</p>
<p><strong>lebdron</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 13:43:38 GMT):<br/>

I am not sure that I got your point. Admin definitely knows the public key of the account, but the private key is kept by the user.

@ShubhamKoli if I get your problem, you create the new account key and send the account creation command with it, and then try to issue a query from the new user signed with that exact key, which fails?
if so, Sara is right to say that there is actually a pair of keys, and the public one is used to ID the user (in creation command as well), while the private - to autoorize him (in query). I see in your code that some public key is generated from random bytes that are not stored - so it seems your keys (pub & priv) are unrelated - this is the problem
</p>
<p><strong>Shubham-koli</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 04:37:05 GMT):<br/>
oh I get it. so overcome my problem I need to create a key pair right? if I may ask you what is the best way to create compatible key pairs?

The creator's private key. Just think about it this way: private key is used for signing the transaction. For account creation, it will be the account creator. Likewise if you are adding assets, the person adding the asset should sign with her private key.

`let crypto = new iroha.ModelCrypto()`
`let newKeypair = crypto.generateKeypair()`
and It is giving me a error.
earlier I used to pass the string created by the 
`let publicKey = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex')`

I want to create a small POC about decentralized digital identity. so I was storing data about users in key value pairs. I found that I've to create a separate transaction for storing each key value pair

Now I'm assuming that if I've to store 10 key value pair I will have to generate 10 transactions.
am I correct?

SetAccountDetail is a command in Iroha terminology. And multiple commands can be combined into one transaction. So, you can store all 10 key-value pair commands within 1 transaction.

Hi. Could you make sure that the server is accessible from the host you are using? For example, you can telnet to Torii port on the server and paste the output here

It should be accessible. As this error is coming up only a few times. Not all the time. You can say 80% requests are successful. Only 20% of the time this grpc error is occurring

You can create distributed ledgers on Iroha, and they will synchronise. If I understand your idea correctly, that seems to be what you're looking for. If you set a resource as an asset and then send it, for example, from user to user.

Hi! Cool cat 🙃 
tps depends on configuration and that depends on what you are doing - so, tps depends (indirectly) on a use case + on the number of nodes (because of the network interactions). Maybe someone could share their performance results?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 02 Sep 2019 11:42:22 GMT):<br/>

It would be good. We tried use Cosmos-sdk before Iroha and cosmos can deal only with 870+ txs per second (business logic is easy, only transfers of coins). Mempool stucks or other ussues occur. Im interested in the potential of Iroha and if it enough stable.

Sorry for delay. Peers should be indicated in genesis block or you can later add them using add_peer option, if everything is already configured. 
</p>
<p><strong>Hong3Nguyen</strong> (Wed, 04 Sep 2019 08:06:29 GMT):<br/>
so if I define in peers.lists with 2 ip addresses, I should start these two machines together at the same time? I tried to do it but it is stuck and does not move to next round (in case of running alone)

I have a problem: from a machine, I generate a genesis.block and keypairs for node0 and node1 (through peers.list: 10.0.0.1:10001 and 10.0.0.2:10001). Then, I copy all of them to another machine to let them communicate together. However, after sending a vote, they does not continue working. 

Particularly, from a machine "[I][Irohad/Consensus/Network]: Send votes bundle[size=1] to 10.0.0.1:10001"

another machine: "][W][Irohad/Consensus/HashGate]: Got a vote from an unknown peer: VoteMessage: [yac hash=YacHash: [round=Round: [block=2, reject=0, ], hashes=VoteHashes: [proposal=, block=, ], ], signature=Signature: [publicKey=8d92c9f94ea97133cf2fae0588a6bb95507f1c177a1a84098030da65da5e57ed, signedData=46778cbd6b6b151f9e8c23c303004c4869a249adca91c9009c0154e47af680d55137ab66a84cb3f605f87166fb37a9274f842da16e6cbe7f570ded3e247cfc02, ], ]"

There used to be the option of json data in Iroha assets long time ago and probably you've seen some legacy code in postgres. Soon there'll be an option of adding complex assets but it will be implemented in a different manner. Meanwhile, I think that in your case it would be a neat solution to store patients as accounts and their records as account details.

no reasonable workaround for now. you can query every peer's asset transactions.

@igor_egorov actually it's different. My use case is to get all transactions for an asset regardless of account. Correct me if I'm wrong - getAccountAssetTransactions only works for 1 account and 1 asset.

The possible way to check all the transactions with the specific asset is to subscribe to blocks stream and check every committed block content.

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 07:45:16 GMT):<br/>

the value has to be a valid JSON string, it is wrapped into double quotes in our code. it is not related to database query formation, so it cannot be an SQL injection. it is just JSON syntax. when it is invalid, the transaction fails.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 10 Sep 2019 07:46:49 GMT):<br/>

by the way, json strings are enclosed into double quotes, and on your screenshot I se single. it is not a concern for Iroha, but may be for your app. if you need double quotes in your account detail value, please try escaping them like `\"this\"`

Hello,

I am trying out the command to SetAccountDetail via the iroha-cli Python SDK. I can set a long string as the value of a key, but I cannot set a valid JSON string as the value to the same key.

Any pointers. 

Thanks.

I can confirm that it works with 1.7.5 cocoapods, interestingly enough no need to revert or uninstall the beta version, simply running “pod _1.7.5_ install” fixes the issue without any source modification, maybe the readme can be updated to lock-in the cocoapods version as such

Is it possible to use one of the key/value fields as a key/value store database?

Hi all. Are there any turn-key tools available for gateways to handle payment processing and smart contracts on Hyperledger? I've browsed through the Github repo and several site pages, but only see low-level elements of these.
...it seems that hyperledger Iroha is similar to what I'm looking for, but further along, say when it comes to adding the payment accounts of customers/counterparties as 'nodes' to the network, is there any tutorial on getting started with such a task?

Hello Igor, thanks for the reply. I am looking for blockchain solution that allows me to implement KYC/ID verification and other other things. The "other things" Iroha can do from what I have read but the KYC/ID part I am not clear on. As a first step the KYC/ID part would be used internally but I could imagine it being "spun-off" and used by several companies. I am trying to see if Iroha fits in either/both cases. In the event that I decide on the 2nd case later on, the users' data must be of course private and only visible to the entity that the client gives access to.

Hi everyone! I'm trying to use iroha in kubernetes without ansible, so I did this: 1.- create the configmap with config.docker and genesis.block files. 2.- create secrets with k8s-peer-keys.yaml and 3.- creta 4 "peers" in a cluster with k8s-iroha.yaml.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 08:55:10 GMT):<br/>

the problem is that I cannot fulfill any transaction with CLI inside a peer because it cannot pass the stateless
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 09:03:34 GMT):<br/>

I mean, I connect to a peer with: kubectl exec -it iroha-0 --container iroha -- /bin/bash. Once inside the container I run iroha-cli with: iroha-cli -account_name node. But when I try to fulfill any transaction or query, I receive this error: Query is stateless invalid.

<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 09:04:18 GMT):<br/>
Hi! Could you please clarify a little more what you are trying to accomplish at this stage? To see how Iroha handles transactions, you can use this tutorial: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/index.html with Python guide (in "Try other guides" section or CLI - it is outdated and being replaced at the moment but it can still handle some operations that can show you how Iroha works).

My project ive been busy on using iroha at its core. the article itself is a roundup for the cryptocurrency, Plenteum, I am a developer for, WhassupZa is the lead dev, he focuses on the Core side of things which is Plenteum's proof of work chain and other tools etc we have developed like fully clientside web wallet, cross platform gui and in the article there are screenshots of the new mobile wallet which is currently being built in react, but where iroha comes in is that I have been doing proof of concepts for KYC stuff amongst others for a use case here in South Africa, i had some pretty neat successes and we pushing the front now where I have created an oracle like api service that facilitates transactions on Iroha and other real life systems like accessing other services APIs. whilst theres a few kinks to work out its more with encryption and actual user experience stuff rather than a technology compatibilty constraint thing.

Is there a query to get all the accounts available by a key?

I am using the Python SDK and there seems to be no
`
GetAllAccounts`

query.

hey Andrei, i have a few questions in regards to the desired outcome,

1. When building iroha, the goal is to reach to the point where the “irohad” executable is build?

2. Should the build process happen within the docker build environment or the host operating system?

3. After the “irohad” binary is built, should it become available as a binary artifact for download or should it push a new docker layer?

Is it possible to have the `can_get_my_account_detail` to be grantable?

I would like the when a search is performed, if the subject running the query lacks this permission, they can't get the result though it  exists. Same way that a subject can ask for can_set_detail permission first before being allowed to set the details.

Hello,... I was wondering whether Iroha supports account verification by Admin when client creates account

Hi! Can you please elaborate? It is possible to use a multi-signature account in your case, if I get it correctly, I think.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 08:07:31 GMT):<br/>
*[Andri Mirandi](https://t.me/andrimirandi)* _via telegram_
yes, ... lets say for a bank transaction
when a user register their account, the bank officer will need to verify it before they interact with blockchain nodes
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 08:24:24 GMT):<br/>

@iuriivv I think that's one of the cases you covered in your presentation? Like business rules verification?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 08:25:31 GMT):<br/>
*[Andri Mirandi](https://t.me/andrimirandi)* _via telegram_
there's a possibility that I can make it like this:
1. user creates the account
2. admin verify and grants the role
is that a good practice ?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 08:26:46 GMT):<br/>
*[Bogdan Mingela](https://t.me/mingela)* _via telegram_
Can't you just delegate a user account creation to the admin? So that users don't have a permission to do it by themselves.
</p>

*[Andri Mirandi](https://t.me/andrimirandi)* _via telegram_
I follow some example on python-iroha, 
I see that everytime user want to make a transaction they need to supply account private key
I try to avoid user to send private key to admin / server
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 22 Oct 2019 08:29:20 GMT):<br/>
*[Bogdan Mingela](https://t.me/mingela)* _via telegram_
Admin needs to know only a public key in order to create user account. Inputs for account creation are: user name, domain name, public key.

it is possibile to implement in a multiple way. For example define default permissions of an account as a minimal. Then when officer will review it, he can give more permissions.

By the way... are there any reference for multiple signing for a single transaction on Iroha ?
lets say I want to withdraw money, so I sign the transaction with my private key, but then later on the bank officer also need to sign the same transaction with his private key
only then, ... the transaction is valid

Hi guys...
I was wondering on iroha-python, where can you see the detail error ?
I have the following result when performing the following script

transaction_tx = iroha.transaction(
    [
        iroha.command('CreateRole', role_name = 'admin2', permissions = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16})
    ]
)
IrohaCrypto.sign_transaction(transaction_tx, ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY)
net.send_tx(transaction_tx)
for status in net.tx_status_stream(transaction_tx):
    print(status)

__________________________________________________

and the result is as follow:
('ENOUGH_SIGNATURES_COLLECTED', 9, 0)
('STATEFUL_VALIDATION_FAILED', 2, 2)
('REJECTED', 4, 0)

@SaraG Howdy - how can I help onboard your teams to transifex?
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Thu, 24 Oct 2019 14:24:34 GMT):<br/>
Hello! We need to switch from the POEditor tool (which is used really poorly) to Transifex – create the Iroha space and transfer what is already translated in PO files (if that's possible). Can you please somehow give me or @lebdron access to add documents there as well as managing the links to the documentation (if that's, again, possible – I might need some time to check their functionality and interface)?

yes, we get iroha library from swift project that import by cocoapods. Project using swift will generate iroha library. then we get those library file import to objective c project (existing app)

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 25 Oct 2019 10:24:21 GMT):<br/>
*[Ruslan Rezin](https://t.me/rirussel)* _via telegram_
the problem is that this approach only creates builds for concreate architecture but testflight requires multiple at once. For your use case i would suggest to build universal static library. There are a lot of tutorials for that, for example, https://www.raywenderlich.com/2658-creating-a-static-library-in-ios-tutorial.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 25 Oct 2019 10:28:58 GMT):<br/>

by the way it is not a problem to use cocoapods in Objective C project. The process is the same as for swift. And due to the fact that Iroha libraries also written in objective c there shouldn't be any problems related to different languages.

Hello, I`m trying to implement transaction with quorum..
but I have some difficulty understanding the sample python codes in https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python/blob/master/examples/batch-example.py

if Alice and Bob operating different client application, does my understanding of how the process should be is correct ?

1. Alice use her Client App to Create Transfer request
- scr_account_id : alice
- dest_account_id : bob
- asset : bitcoin
- amount : 1
- additionally the quorum is set to 1, and creator is set to alice
2. Bob use his client app to get all pending transactions and add sign that transaction 
3. the transaction is success, and the value 1 is transfered to bob

getPendingTransactions returns those created by the query initiator, so you can access the transactions created by you

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sun, 27 Oct 2019 08:11:42 GMT):<br/>

So you need to create an account and add one more signatory to it. Then set the account quorum to 2. When creating a transaction for transfer set the transaction quorum for 2 as well. Use different keypairs but one account for signing independently

HI, I tried to use Iroha-Java for android project. But, during the build I got the errors

More than one file was found with OS independent path 'META-INF/INDEX.LIST'

More than one file was found with OS independent path 'META-INF/io.netty.versions.properties'

Fixed both with 

packagingOptions {
    exclude 'META-INF/INDEX.LIST'
    exclude 'META-INF/io.netty.versions.properties'
}

But, after that I got another one

Installation did not succeed.
The application could not be installed: INSTALL_FAILED_NO_MATCHING_ABIS
Installation failed due to: 'null'
Retry

I’m using gradle for integration. Android Studio 3.5.1

How to use Iroha-Java sdk for android ?

Hi there. I hope somebody can help me. I did follow the instructions on how to setup and run a local node of Iroha. So far so good. 
However, I would like to now deploy 2 nodes in 2 different machines and connect them so that i can fully understand how to create a decentralized and distributed Iroha network.
There is some instructions on Github but I get lost on the steps. 
Anybody kind enough to give me a hand? 
Thanks!

As far as I know, the initial release date for Hyperledger Iroha with Burrow integration was set to the end of September, but then, due to the large scope of new features, the team decided to take more time to test things out. I think you can talk with Eugene @ea_kovalev  about the details of Burrow's status, but on the last meeting, there was information that it is ready and waits for the release itself to be shipped.

these strings look like a1bdb134305a811ec90f75480647c1475e89617488d1a1078b267b9bec1dafe0, right? they are hex-encoded. you need to convery hex strings to bytes

in java you can do that with 
`byte[] bytes = DatatypeConverter.parseHex(...);`
and `bytes` will be exactly 32 bytes

Thanks! I managed to move forward and connect to the node via Java code 💪

Now I have more questions if i may:

I would like to connect 2 nodes that are deployed in 2 different machines (AWS EC2 instances). All ports are open so no firewall should be stopping any connection.

I try running this transaction but it always fails:

    Transaction tx = new TransactionBuilder(ACCOUNT, Instant.now(Clock.systemUTC()))
        .addPeer(NODE_1_ADDRESS, node1PubBytes)
        .sign(keyPair)
        .build();

Account = admin@test
node address = IP ADDRESS : PORT
keypair = keypair for account

Thanks in advance!

Is there a way to implement

as grantable the same way
`

I would only accounts with authorized permissions to be able to query that data as opposed to moving my logic to the backend and keeping a separate database to implement this.

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sun, 10 Nov 2019 20:36:57 GMT):<br/>
*Javier Ochoa* _via telegram_
mmm... i think i might have found the issue. When checking logs on postgres, i noticed that it gives an error complaining that primary key for peer table already exists. 

I see that primary key in peer table is actually the public key of the node. And so i checked, and find out that the getting-started guide leads to a situation where both iroha nodes have the same public key, even though they have deployed on different machines. 

And so the command to postgres fail.

Now I wonder how to proceed. Can I create multiple nodes on one instance of iroha?

Javier no, you can't. Each node must have its own key pair. You can run multiple instances of iroha on the same server, but each one will need it's own postgres DB and communication ports. Read the docs https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deploy/multiple.html

1. yes, consensus protocol will sync all peers
2. you can verify that by looking at block storage. it is configured in iroha.config (json config, "block_store_path" or something like that). basically, it is just a dir with a bunch of JSON files named 00000000, 00000001, etc. For every successful round new block containing transactions collected during round appears

I am not official support for HL Iroha, but i would say the answer might be "no, there is no such implementation", and so you might have to build whatever custom logic you need outside the current capabilities of Iroha.

Once again I got issues when communicating between peers. Even though the second peer is added on the peer table from the first node, when executing new transactions, they seem not to be propagated and so they dont end up being successfully transacted.

I get these logs from iroha:

Then, in my case that should be not a problem since both nodes are installed with default configuration, so both should be then listening to 10001 port. 🤔

Hi Javier, how many peers do you initially have in your genesis block? If more than one, do they see each other so that the problem is only being encountered when you try to add a new peer by sending a transaction with addPeer command?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Wed, 13 Nov 2019 09:10:15 GMT):<br/>
*Javier Ochoa* _via telegram_
actually the problem is not when adding the peer but afterwards. I did manage to execute the addpeer command successfully. However, all transactions fail after i did add the peer. Whatever it is to add some data to the account or move some money or anything. 

And i did start with the iroha getting started example. I did use the genesis block from the github repo and so on. The only thing i did change manually was the public/private key of the node, which i created using the Iroha Java SDK client and pasted manually.

actually, i ran the command "docker port iroha" and i get "50051/tcp -> 0.0.0.0:50051" as response. This makes me believe that the iroha nodes have the port 10001 deactivated, and so i dont think it is possible to connect nodes via that port using the default config from the repo in github

the port is correct as long as it is the one specified in your config file:
`
{
  ...
  "torii_port" : 50051,
  "internal_port" : 10001,
  ...
}`


Based on what I see all you need to do is to tell docker to publish port 10001 to the host machine (same way it's done for 50051)

Hello! I did re-created my two nodes once again, and this time i runned iroha docker container with port 10001 enabled as well. 

After adding peer 2 to peer 1, i executed one transaction. This time the connection error did not appear, but the transaction does not go forward anyway. It seems to get stuck.

It all depends on what's your definition of stable. Stable as in it won't crash after an hour. Or slow down after drastically after 1000 transactions. Or you don't have to rewrite your code or rebuild the whole chain when the platform version changes ?

There are also others that are shared on HL website: https://www.hyperledger.org/resources/blockchain-showcase?profile=biocrypt-technologies-inc and https://www.hyperledger.org/resources/blockchain-showcase?profile=ikioo-technologies-inc - these project do something different.

As a trivial solution for now, you can attach a secondary transfer command as a fee when creating your transaction. But validation process has to be implemented offchain if you need it.

Ok I understood.  If validation happened offchain then I think it's not secure. Is it?

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 06:16:08 GMT):<br/>
*[Alexey Chernyshov](https://t.me/Alexey_Chernyshov)* _via telegram_
It depends on implementation. If every node validates using some consensus, it is secure. For example, there can be a batch with 2 transactions - 1st is a transfer with client signature and 2nd is a validation transaction with multisig of fee validators. The fee validation logic is off-chain in this case.
Another approach is on-chain smart contracts that are under development for now.

Hi, I'm trying a PoC in iOS and playing with assets I notice that if I try to get account assets for and asset with balance 0, it throws an unmanaged error saying: IRAmountFactory "Amount must be positive".
If I try to manage the error by using IRPromise's OnError for something like returning 0 instead of propagating the error, the promise is released and the control is lost.
</p>
<p><strong>dhompanera</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 13:12:59 GMT):<br/>
In the Example code for iOS, OnError is only used at the first level, and instead for something like check if an account does exist or not, it returns an IRErrorResponse, which should be the case in my opinion for asset's balance equal to 0, but it is not.

Hi guys. Have a small, but tricky question about Iroha: Lets assume I have N-number of Iroha nodes in my consorcium. There several !independent! %organisations% in this consorcium. Does it mean that each organisation practically has similar data-slice in its Postgresql databases on nodes? So, technically, system administrators of each company with root access can see all information. If yes, then how Iroha handle "private" transactions? Does Iroha has any kind of World-state-private data storage mechanisms like... for instance - channels in Fabric IBM or Tessera in Quorum JM, etc

Each company can run iroha in a private enclave (like a docker image) that no one has access to, in case you want to preserve privacy from any local admins who may be able to access the physical hard disk.

"Each company can run iroha in a private enclave" - thats understandable, the question is that: does the data in all consorcium companies' Postgres databases is similar? If yes, how to establish "private" transactions inbetween 2 conmanies, while i can have 10 companies in the network

Yes, all databases are the same because of the consensus. You can limit what users can query using the permission API and run iroha in an enclave so that you cannot access the local postgresql db, in order to keep transactions private.

So, i can limit it only inside Iroha Network 🙁 But i can not limit it physically in every company inside consorcium. My idea is to allow several companies to have direct access to Postgresql instance in order to bring them possibilities to "BI" the data and use it in different systems. "run iroha in an enclave" - i can, but i can not control how other companies run Iroha, espessially in Hybrid environment. May i ask you about any Roadmap ideas like "Tessera in Quorum"?

The way other companies run iroha can be controlled somewhat through regular audits. This works for companies in a consortium, for instance, where data security standards already apply

Sounds good - "regular audits" and make sense, however thats only QC side of the coin. QA is needed in case of GDPR. Here is a trouble. Do you have any GDPR case studies within Iroha environment?

In our work with identity we don’t store any PII in iroha itself. Instead we use the w3c proposed standards for DIDs and VCs

Thanks for the links. Basically, Iroha is single layer blockchain Shared Network with identical Nodes (components and rights)? Or here might be exceptions? Lets assume that i have 10 nodes. Can i grand accees to only 3 nodes to read data from GDPR storage? Then, these 3 nodes make confirm/concensus about GDPR data inputs. Then, these 3 nodes propose formed transaction to the Network. If these logic does not work, then how can i prove validity of external data, while only limited number of the companies have an access to GDPR storage.

I am using my MacOS and have docker 19.3 installed.  I need help with this issue I don't if it is the OS or something else.

@siroramirez Hello. There is no method in the library as I see here https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python/blob/master/iroha/iroha.py . It would be great if you contributed it into the library.

Hello guys, wanted to ask! If creating a website of betting type of system, what kind of advantages brings hyperledger, ethereum? 

Hyperledger programmers would be more available of the native languages and its a more controlled system for encoding custom functionality plus its more secure? What are your thoughts? (Btw the asset built in hyperledger would be ethereum token.)

Thanks for help!

So its basically ethereum smart contracts vs hyperledger chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 13 Jan 2020 13:20:15 GMT):<br/>
*[Sara](https://t.me/liralemur)* _via telegram_
Hi! Well, Hyperledger is not 1 but many technologies and also, those are private blockchain technologies, unlike public blockchains like bitcoin.

In HL Iroha we have pre-set contracts called commands (like add asset, add account information, transfer asset). Those provide most of the features needed for transactions and they are tested, unlike smart contracts they will surely do only what they are supposed to do and nothing more. We also work on supporting smart contracts via HL Burrow in case someone wants to add some custom logic. 

I am not sure about Ethereum and even other HL technologies, but Iroha has simple interface and several libraries for different languages like Java (also supports development for Android), JavaScript, Python, Swift (for iOS). So it might be convenient when it comes to developers.

Unfortunately, I do not know much about other technologies, mostly Iroha)

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 17 Jan 2020 04:09:15 GMT):<br/>
*[Mikhail Boldyrev](https://t.me/mboldyrev)* _via telegram_
the only way now is to request all the committed blocks and parse them at client side searching for setAccoutDetail commands. but in case you know a subset of accounts that only might change the details, you can also get their transactions history (getAccountTransactions). no clean way to get only the details history now.

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 18 Jan 2020 04:28:16 GMT):<br/>
*[Mikhail Boldyrev](https://t.me/mboldyrev)* _via telegram_
essentially none. but *peer* is mostly used in context of multiple nodes (aka peers) interaction, while *node* is more apt for single instance per se.

yes, node has a keypair. but the second part of your question seems inaccurate.
peer and node refer to the same thing. though when we speak in context of inter-*peer* interaction, we usually say peer, otherwise node.

Oh, I see. That's a weird note :) I believe what it means is that we do not know if that example was implemented at the time. But now, as I said, we are working on something like that and so far it is going good – so if you decide to use this use-case with Iroha and create a good implementation logic, there is no reason any difficulties should occur

For an Android app, usually Google Play Market is used as a distribution platform (market). 
To do so, you need to generate .apk in Android Studio, create an application in Play Market console, put your .apk into the Play Market applicaiton.
You can also use third-party distribution platforms, like Firebase App Distribution, the process is more or less the same there.

Regarding Iroha SDK for Android app, it doesn't affect the distribution process, so you can you it without any issues

Hello, I am developing an Android app and trying to use the iroha-java client. Right now I am facing an issue that I can't send Queries. Transactions work fine, but queries always produce errors when sent with IrohaAPI.query(myQuery). 

The errors are always "Unsupported value:  iroha.protocol.QueryResponse.query_hash" even though everything seems correct. If I pass clearly incorrect values like say wrong username the  response is "Unsupported value iroha.protocol.QueryResponsr.error_response" so I believe I pass everything correctly but I may be wrong. Can you possibly help with that? It would be much appreciated.

                        .sign(defaultKeyPair).build()
        ).blockingLast()
)

println(
        iroha.api.query(Query.builder(accountId, 1L)
                .getAccountAssetTransactions(accountId, assetId, 5, null)

Could you try using `QueryAPI` instead of `IrohaAPI` for your query? There are different return value types of the methods. I'm just interested in a class scope of the issue. So just do smth like as an experiment
`
val queryAPI = QueryAPI(api, "test2@ImpiloLogTest", Utils.parseHexKeypair("key1","key2"))
val res = queryAPI.getAccountAssetTransactions("test2@ImpiloLogTest", "login_attempt#ImpiloLogTest" , 5)`

@mingela  @mrZizik Hello again , sorry I didn't get back to you until I did some more searching and testing, as to not waste your time. Unfortunately the issue still persists. 

Previousy  I was using Iroha version:1.0.0.rc3 and Java library version 6.1.0
I updated my version to the same version as @mingela , namely Iroha 1.1.1 and Iroha-Java 6.1.0

I have confirmed that I can actually execute the queries from iroha-cli so that doesn't seem to be the issue.

I have also confirmed that transactions from iroha-java can be executed correctly without issue.

The error message itself changes depending on the query I am trying to execute for example when sending the following query: 

`
val queryAPI = QueryAPI(api, "admin@test", Utils.parseHexKeypair("key1","key2"))
              val res = queryAPI.getAccount("admin@test")`


The error specifically is: Unsupported value: iroha.protocol.AccountResponse.account

In addition, what I didn't mention before is that in order to use the iroha-java library in android without error, I had to take the following steps.

1) Include the following library `
implementation 'org.apache.xerces:com.springsource.org.apache.xerces:2.9.1'`
 , otherwise whenever any function was called from the iroha-java library it would crash . - This was happening in every version of the library I tried.

2)In the module dependencies I had to add `
packagingOptions {
        pickFirst 'META-INF/INDEX.LIST'
        pickFirst 'META-INF/io.netty.versions.properties'
    }`


In order for the gradle  to compile succesfully. This only happened with the iroha-java library included.

Other information about my setup: 
Only other library included is flutter and  `
  implementation 'com.android.support:multidex:1.0.3' `


If you have any more feedback it would be appreciated

Trading in Bitcoin is highly profitable and to a large extent very reliable. Truth be told they're alot of scam account and fake profile out there and I've been a victim a couple of times which made me almost lose hope in profiting from bitcoin not until I came across Mrs Prisca Nelson profile from a post i checked, her profile and found it very convincing. After some days I contacted her, she gave me a break down on what to do I funded my trading account and 3days later I got my profit and ever since then I've been able to make a lot of money with her help. so anyone having a hard time trading or interested in trading I think Mrs Prisca is the right woman for the job

Hi folks, could you help me out with Iroha? I am testing a simple 4-peer network in Docker but there are problems with the consensus getting stuck. 😕

Thanks! 😊 I am using Docker for Mac but this problem also occurs on native Linux machines. Iroha is built from the latest commit on master. I have a relatively small vote-delay configured (100ms like stated in the docs). When starting the chain via docker-compose, each peer has a delay of around 3 seconds (first peer starts immediately, the second one after 3 seconds, the third after 6...). They all start but after some messages exchanged, they seem to get stuck. All peers are in the genesis block. Here is a GitHub repo with the scenario and a log file: https://github.com/felix-gohla/iroha-fail.

Hi! This seems like a known issue with consensus. Currently, some of the nodes from genesis block should  be started simultaneously. nodes started later should be added with addPeer command to the running network. I think this will be fixed soon in 1.2 release.

would you say Iroha is mainly for mobile development? Or could handle more enterprise backend use cases? I guess more focus on stability and HA.
</p>

@trepca It's not only for mobile development. But Iroha has libraries that make it easy to build client apps for mobiles. But Iroha is more like a backend itself. Stability depends a lot on deployment and configuration, but if everything is correct, Iroha will be running smoothly and reliably :) What's HA? )

@trepca got it :) After the peer is back online, it will automatically synchronise from the genesis block. Soon there'll be a quicker option, but now it only syncs from other peers based on the genesis block

Hi :) I know, this message is old, but could you elaborate on that? What is a scenario when the algorithm isn't BFT? We are doing research on high throughput and BFT capable blockchains. The paper says, that YAC itself is BFT. Is it a problem with the implementation or the algorithm?

Just one idea, you might want to create an asset type for each citizen with amount of 1. That way can ensure each citizen only can cast one vote. It probably sounds counterintuitive. The conventional thinking would be to create votes as a single asset type and allocate 1 vote to each citizen

Hi, we've done some research on this topic but we did not find a way to insert malicious transactions. We only managed to reverse the order of transactions in a evil ordering service (if the TX is not part of a Ordered Batch) or to omit some transactions. If there is a scenario in which you can insert a transaction into everyone's BlockStore that would be rejected normally, could you please describe it?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 09:04:11 GMT):<br/>
*[Leo](https://t.me/iptelephony)* _via telegram_
Depending on what u mean by malicious. There's an example of overspending in the docs, scroll down to 3.3.1.3 https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/cli-guide.html

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 09:07:04 GMT):<br/>
*[Leo](https://t.me/iptelephony)* _via telegram_
If u are trying to ask if it's possible to insert malicious transaction that would pass stateful validation, that could be really hard. I suppose if u have access to the postgresql, you can try to alter the database directly
</p>
<p><strong>felix_gohla</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 09:21:37 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, we found this example. We mainly focused on "privilege escalation" from an unprivileged user (like 'AddAssetQuantity' from a user that is not allowed to), but did not succeed in finding an example. But then the question is: why should a evil ordering service and _undue network latency_ lead to YAC not being BFT? Yes of course, you are able to drop some transactions or reverse the order in unordered batches. But Is this enough to call YAC being *not BFT*?

Yes of course, you are able to drop some transactions or reverse the order in unordered batches. But Is this enough to call YAC being *not BFT*? Every node is doing stateful validation. Therefore, if there are only f faulty nodes in 3f+1 total nodes, then no stateful invalid transaction should be stored in honest nodes, right?

If one of the researchers will have time today, I asked him to help with that case when it's not bft. I believe it had something to do with slower peers but not sure

<p><strong>lebdron</strong> (Mon, 17 Feb 2020 11:31:07 GMT):<br/>
Hi @felix_gohla ! The example of BFT violation is the following. Each peer requests a proposal in the beginning of a round from the current ordering service. If the OS is malicious, it can send different proposals to different nodes. Assume that there are 4 peers, and the OS sent value X to 2 nodes and value Y to other node. On voting phase, there are 3 honest nodes, which say that there are 2 votes for value X and one vote for value Y. Then a malicious node sends vote for value X to 2 peers, making a commit, since there are 3 votes for the same value; and value Y to other node, making a reject, since it will have 2 votes for value X, and 2 votes for value Y. Therefore, the network is left in an inconsistent state.

Lazaridis Hi, i think the problem with your question is that it asks for something that is hard to define as a clear and objective measurement. You ask "how decoupled" and "how easy". What answer can I think about? "Somewhat decoupled, but could be better" and "not really easy if you did not ever look into the code". The effort depends on skills, experience.

Apart from your question, we have plans on reworking consensus interface to make it _more decoupled_ and _easier_ to change. And this task is not yet estimated in working hours nor in release date.

I mean am using a iroha to create digital assets... Am programming a finite number of assets(like a closed system sort of) that circulate between accounts by transaction send/receive.(so no net loss in the system right).

Now how do i add more assets to the system.

I mean if i coded the network for 1000 ryos(asset name) to be mined, how do i add more assets to system to make it maybe 1023 ryos(total assets in circulation) because some Account bought ryos with fiat currency.

this is very easy using Iroha. you can make an asset "ryos" and a role like "ryos admin" with permissions to add and remove ryos. the account that do not have this role/permission can not change the total number of ryos. though they can transfer them if they have such permissions. here is the permissions directory https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/develop/api/permissions.html

@parra_mutex Mikhail's recommendation is probably the most appropriate. In one of the system I have implemented, we used a batch of multisig transactions. One actor mints the asset, another actor must acknowledge the receipt of the fiat currency, otherwise the entire minting fails. Each actor has its own list of signatories to sign transactions on its behalf.  We then set the actor's account quorum to set the minimum number of signatures required to approve the transaction.

I see that command prompts here and in the s-shot above difffer. this might mean that you are starting iroha in a different env (most likely docker) than netstat. so the port may be used in docker and not used in host.

Hi! transaction hash is the ID you are looking for. please take a look at this example: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/1.1.1/maintenance/permissions.html#can-get-all-txs

generally, I think that something like
`
binascii.hexlify(IrohaCrypto.hash(tx))`

will do it

Please be observant and mind who you invest with, some time ago when I started investment as a beginner I was scammed by different fake managers who promised to return my money with its profit but they didn't, but after i realized it was all scammed I begins to cry but crying couldn't bring back my lost, but to God be the glory i came across this man Mr David through some people giving a good testimonies about him and I have to give him a try again after promising, although  my doubts at first because I have to be observant this time, so I give a try and after 4days i got my first withdrawal and was so happy then I trusted him, he also let me know that it was God who helped me and not him I was very happy thanking him but he said I should thank God for directing me to him. 
Please I want everyone to start investing with him and not fake managers who called themselves real and legit manager. @online300 helped me, he can help you too.

I managed to connect my db in AWS with iroha node (by configuring the `database` section in `config.docker` and the environment variables in my `docker-compose.yml`).
My question relates to the `maintenance database`. When I use the host name of my aws db the node fails. When I use just `postgres` it succeeds. However, there is no reference to any `postgres` in my app

I have a question here regarding creating new accounts in iroha. i setup my network using the sample example network given in the quick start guide documentation. i logged in as admin@test and look to create new account with a custom domain name. I was filling up details like account name, domain id and public key. i even send the transaction to iroha peer(localhost) but when i query the status of the transaction, using its hash, the terminal replies me that the transaction has been rejected. Is there an alternative on how to add new accounts to iroha?

hi! maintenance db is the database that iroha uses to connect when performing maintenancce operations with its working database. one cannot drop a database within a connection to that database. and obviously you have to connect somwhow when the working db does not exist yet.

in most distributions there is a default database named `postgres` by default, but we cannot rely on it to the extent of hard-coding this value into iroha.

Personally I won't advice running on 32 bit x86. Most distributions have dropped supoort for x86, you will run into issues getting up to date versions of third party libraries and build tools. And, Iroha does require a very up to date tool chain to build. Just my two cents. Are you building for embedded Linux?

I think what Sara meant to say is the quick start only provides a basic example. You need to read up on the commands and queries to build bigger projects. It’s perfectly ok to use the docker image without having to build from scratch. Unless you intend to make changes to the core Iroha functionality

it is not possible for grantable permissions and does not match iroha model. account B explicitly grants permissions for his data.

is it possible to add a new user from the python library call without having to explicitly add a new user from the iroha-cli command line? i tried this and it added a new user, but the user description files (.priv & .pub key files) didn't get added to the example folder directory. why is my previous comment deleted?

Hi! iroha-cli only helps you to generate the keypair in this case. You can generate the keypair in python code as well. Probably you ran iroha-cli outside the example folder, and .pub and .priv files were saved in another directory.

umm, what i meant in my comment earlier is that using iroha-cli adds the .pub and .priv file in the example directory. But when I use python Iroha library, the .pub and .priv fie is not added. Could you possibly give me some hints as to how it can be done using the python library calls? thanks!

hi all! i am trying to use the python library to transfer custom created coins/tokens (domain & token creation done successfully) from one account to another(account creation has been done successfully too, confirmed by the creation of .pub and .priv files in example folder). So when I transfer the amount from src to dest account with desired amount and then signature from the .priv file, I am getting this error that say "STATELESS_VALIDATION_FAILED". I viewed the amount of tokens in the source account and the transferred amount is contained within the balance of the account. what could I have possibly done wrong? thanks!

If it helps to narrow things down a bit, I have a load balancer configured at the edge of my network for TCP traffic. As far as I know, the iroha clients communicate using grpc over a TCP connection, similarly to how browsers set use HTTP(S) to fetch resources over a TCP connection.

This eliminates my load balancer from being the problem I think.

Hi! Do you have a simple kubernetes service for load balancing between Iroha peers or do you use some of Istio's features ?

Not exactly, GRPC uses HTTP2 instead of HTTP1. HTTP2 is made for long term connections rather than multiple connections and usual load balancers like the internal Kubernetes load balancer (K8s Service) is only layer 4. This can create problems with sessions being terminated suddenly or requests not being handled properly. You can find more info about this in this link and you can use your existing Istio infrastructure to handle GRPC load balancing with the instructions from this link

Hi, I'm trying to create a peer network with Iroha, but I can't get it. I'll tell you my case. I have a docked node deployed on a computer. However, I need to add, to the same network, another computer, make it another node. The first node is run in the footsteps of Iroha's doc. For the other node, I have tried to run nothing and add it with addPeer, to run a new single instance on the new host and port and do an addPeer on the old instance to that new instancai, etc... I can't find any guide that explains how to add nodes once the network is already running with "addPeer" (none defines how to use this instruction correctly). Please, could you help me?

Hola y bienvenido Javier!
I think adding a peer was considered so easy that there is no documentation required =)
So, what you need to do, is generate a keypair for the new peer and ensure that the new peer has the same genesis block with the target network, and that it is reachable from other peers. Then you issue the `AddPeer` command that is processed by the former network, and after it is committed, on the next round, the new peer is considered part of the network. There are special cases though, like when most peers from the genesis block were removed, or when the new peer is started before it is added, so it may be worth writing a doc page. The latter issue is about to be fixed (in 1.2 I think), but for now, please start the new peer after the `AddPeer` command is committed.

@sorabot  I'm trying to do what you're telling me to do, but it's not working. I'll explain the steps I'm taking, so you can tell me what's wrong. Now I'm using two docker containers in the same machine.

1. I create a network docker
2. I create a postgraduate docker container in the default port
3. I create a blockstore
4. I create an iroha docker container with port 50051:50051, with the previous postgres and blockstore

5. He created another postgraduate docker container, in a different port 
6. I create another new blockstore
7. I create a docker container of iroha (newiroha) with the port 50052:50051, with the new postgres and blockstore. I change the name of the postgres container in the config.docker to work properly

From here, I run the bash in the first iroha container. I create an asset in it and add the new peer, with the IP address of the newiroha docker container and the port 50052 (I have also tried with the 50051). For that, I use iroha-cli, with the addPeer option, where I indicate the commented address, a new public key (that I have invented) and I execute the option "Send to Iroha peer" to 0.0.0.0 and 50051. The result of the transaction is "Transaction was successfully committed". If I try to access from the newiroha node to the asset I created in the first one through the server 0.0.0:50051 it doesn't work. I have to do it with the <dirIp iroha1>:50051.

I tried to do steps 5,6 and 7 after the addPeer, but it doesn't work

The genesis is the same in both cases

I'm using postgres and it's good when i have only one peer. The problem is to connect various peers in a network. I think is not sufficiently detailed and it's difficult if you've never worked with these kinds of tools. There is some place where you can see all the steps: how to properly generate the public key for the new node (besides I must provide one when I deploy it, which I don't know if it is the same one), what values must be indicated to each file, the exact steps to deploy each node and connect them, etc..??

If thats where you specified these users and transactions you mention, they will always be present as long as you keep using that genesis block. Otherwise, it's possible you have some confusion with which docker container you're running/querying etc.

this is due to malformed config file. the phrase is "cut" because its predicate is an empty string denoting the config root (yes it is weird). so it says that the config root lacks `block_store_path` element. it is not an optional in 1.1.1

@Javier3rm the thing that looks suspicious is

did you use some tool like `iroha-cli` or the python lib to generate another keypair for the new peer? and did you start the second peer with its own keypair, different from that of peer1 and matching the public key in `AddPeer` command?

that is possible (you can add all the nodes in genesis block) but not required (you can also add them when the network is running).
the key thing is that the IP addresses you store in ledger are used for peers to communicate

One question. Why, if I do an addPeer on port 10001 on each node, should I connect through the 50051? Actually, in the 50051 there is Torii, which derives the request to 10001, where the internal node is. This is true?

I put 172.22.0.5 and 172.22.0.3 (the IPs of docker containers) in genesis' addPeers and the result is the same. I didn't understand so much this addPeer in 10001, because we connect between nodes across using 50051 port (in my case 50051 and 50052, because i run two containers in the same machine)

After trying different ways, I haven't found anything that works.

If I remove all addPeer instructions from the genesis.block, it tells me a bug like that: "Irohad startup failed: Have no peers in WSV after restoration!"

If I pick up a node with the configuration file, do an addPeer, pick up the other with the same genesis file (modifying in the addPeer of 10001 the peerKey by the public peerKey that I have created previously), both are not connected.

In short:

1. I raise a node in a container, using the following genesis.block and config.docker

2. I use the instruction "iroha-cli --account_name node1 --new_account" to generate the keys for the new node

3. I make an addPeer to 172.22.0.5:10001 (the address of the container I will raise for the new node) and the public key I have generated in the previous step.

4. I raise a new node in a container, using the same genesis.block as before and config.docker and having in the directory the public and private keys that I have generated.

Is that all?

but as shown in the above message, existing block store are rather restored! how can i get over this? should i define my block store to be rather stored at a different place than /tmp/block_store/ ??

Hi! Generally we track issues in Jira: https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/IR
also, we are participating in HL internship program, so if you are a student you can apply to one of 5 projects with Iroha.
If you get lost in our Jira (which is a mess...) we can help you find an interesing piece of work, just say what area are you interested in most and do you want an easy-breezy taskie or a moderate chunk.
Or you can just search the source for `TODO` tag.

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sun, 05 Apr 2020 11:57:58 GMT):<br/>

you can also build any particular test by its name, but if you build the target `test`, you should have all the 170 binaries ready, because `test` target only runs the tests, not builds them. maybe we should change that.

*Dinis* _via telegram_
Hello.

I'm currently working on a blockchain based approach for sharing personal health data as a MSc thesis.
The fact that the approach uses blockchain, has lead to seek for Hyperledger technologies. I was particularly attracted by Hyperledger Iroha due to the additional features it provides when compared to Hyperledger Fabric, namely the API construction automation and SQL-like based queries to the information stored on the blockchain. However, the YAC consensus algorithm concerns me in the sense that I need the consensus of the system to be customizable and I would like to place a question about the possibility of changing the consensus algorithm.

Our approach requires that some code is executed (that involves executing an external program) in order to validate each transaction. Would it be possible (relatively easily) to modify the consensus algorithm and enforce each node to perform such task to validate a transaction? If yes, how could I do it?

Thanks in advance.

Best Regards,
Dinis

Would it be too much of a security compromise to add the ability to update an account's public key?

Perhaps via `SetAccountDetail`
or I suppose it would be more sensible to add a new API command like 'UpdatePublicKey'

I am thinking of building a CBDC based prototype application in Iroha. However, I am still a bit unclear on the architecture of Iroha and so I would like to request some clarification on Iroha: after experimenting a few functionalities of Iroha, I found that Iroha offers the feature of account creation as well as token creation. What confuses me is that, is HL Iroha more useful in implementing account-based CBDC or token-based CBDC? There is this concept of assets that can be created which is somehow similar to token-based architecture. On the other hand, users have to register under a particular domain by creating accounts which is the concept of account-based architecture. More confusingly, isn't account-based architecture supposed to user/password login with some verifiable or supported documents for identity verification. But when we create accounts in HL Iroha, we are provided with ED25519 keypairs (like used in wallet addresses) I would like to request some light on this.

@MaharjanSajan_twitter I don't know what you mean exactly by account based and token based. Iroha can do both at the same time, as I understand it, one does not contradict another - accounts (users) can have tokens (assets). Maybe you are referencing some classification? Can you share a link?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 24 Apr 2020 00:27:40 GMT):<br/>
*[Leo](https://t.me/iptelephony)* _via telegram_
Hi Sajan, I think you are comparing Iroha to a crypto currency like Bitcoin. An account in Iroha is a wallet to hold tokens. The account id is the wallet address. To implement a CBDC in Iroha, you need both accounts and tokens.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 24 Apr 2020 01:10:24 GMT):<br/>
*[Sajan Maharjan](https://gitter.im/MaharjanSajan_twitter)* _via gitter_
yes, i feel like Iroha is a bit of both. As per my understanding account-based CBDCs require you to create an account in the server (like bank accounts having user-name and password) and you could use password or even other verification (like national identity) to confirm that it is truly you. On the other hand, token based CBDCs use the public key cryptography infrastructure to verify it is truly you. I feel like Iroha is a bit of both because it requires account creation under particular domain as well as use PKI to initiate transactions.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 24 Apr 2020 01:21:02 GMT):<br/>
*[Leo](https://t.me/iptelephony)* _via telegram_
Iroha uses PKI for transactions, an account alone cannot be used for transactions. There's no account/password authentication in Iroha, that has to happen off-chain. Due to its nature, Iroha has more flexibility. For example, an account can be delegated to other accounts by adding the delegates as signatories to the master account.

Some details like the number of nodes is not public knowledge, but the TPS is high enough to serve a population like in Cambodia.

From our analysis, at least 300 TPS is enough for handling retail payments in a country the side of Cambodia. So the system we built is more than capable for handling that.

Sajan, the pic you sent says that there are some active connections to the database that you configured your iroha to use. we currently assume that iroha node is the only user of its working database, so when you pass `--overwrite_ledger` flag it tries to recreate it, which it cannot do when there are other active sessions. please check who else is using this DB. if other nodes do - it is completely wrong, as each node must have its own DB.

also, _irohad_ is the daemon process name and not a command to create or modify roles, so I cannot understand what you mean by your second message.

Ry Jones Risky but ok. Do you suppose a green fields project should start with iroha 1 or simply wait for 2? If there is a developer release coming in the next couple months, i can focus on other things while i wait. It seems different enough in the logistics of how you define complex financial flows to justify this approach

I know that there are other hyperledger projects, but for the most part they lack product sense, and have a degree of bloat that only a committee can produce. HL Iroha is different because it is coming from a filled need. I used Iroha 1 to prototype a marketplace/economy for Verifiable carbon standard fulfillment and clearing. The basic unit of this network is less-so a simple transaction and more the fulfillment of a standard contract and a clearinghouse mechanism that reassures multiple parties that their part of the process is handled securely and safely. To this end, the Iroha 1 multisig tools drew me, but standard smart contracts would probably be a better, more flexible solution. The VCS space moves in spurts and speaks in bloated standards so the extra flexibility of smart contracts might ultimately prove essentail

I am a newbie to iroha and i do not know much about irohad. I had found out about how to overwrite the genesis block and add new roles to the blockchain by modifying the genesis.block file. Then I used the irohad command to overwrite the genesis block which seems to have failed.

I think I have only created single node in the system. Is there a workaround as to how I can create and modify roles in the blockchain?

Regarding the timeline, there are still many uncertainties about v2. Asset creation and transfer should already work and consensus is well on its way. Lots of things like Permissions are not yet created, though. Also v2 will have a Turing complete instruction set and this design is still being done.

AFAIK, in theory, it is possible to run Iroha on arm devices but it would require a lot of resources. But I meant the client app that you can connect to Iroha backend

I might be wrong but I don't think it's possible to add permissions to an existing role. As a workaround, you can create a new role with the can_subtract_asset_qty permission and append the new role to all users who can burn tokens.

you have to find out, whether any role has the permission to either subtract asset qty or root permission, and issue the commands you want to create & assign desired roles using an account with that permissions. if there is no such account, your only option is to create a new ledger.

For the capstone, I'm developing a C++ application that needs to manipulate assets on the Iroha network.

hi huveja!
iroha-cli is a standalone tool for creating keys, blocks, sending txs and queries from command line. and it is outdated. you do not need it in your project. you should rather look at files in `shared_model` directory. it has the grpc & protobuf definitions in `shared_model/schema`, where you want the command & qry service in `endpoint.proto`. also there are our wrappers over generated protobuf code and some builders for protocol objects, which you may choose to use or not to use and stick to the generated code.

Hi Mikhail! thanks for the clue! Nowm I'm following it, so I've started to read the documentation on [gRPC docs](https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/cpp/) to understand about gRPC and how it is used from C++.

@Raffaele Diana: As I remember one of files has problem with building (it is consuming all RAM) as I remember it is file on_demand_ordering_init.cpp
What I did was to build this file on my computer with cross compiler only that file then copy.
First I run:
make VERBOSE=true
then I saw command:
 cd /home/pi/Desktop/iroha/zbudowane/irohad/main && /usr/bin/c++  -DBOOST_NO_RTTI -I/home/pi/Desktop/iroha/irohad -I/home/pi/Desktop/iroha/libs -I/home/pi/Desktop/iroha/shared_model -I/home/pi/Desktop/iroha/zbudowane/schema -isystem /usr/local/include -isystem /usr/include/soci -isystem /usr/include/postgresql -std=c++14 -Wall -fdiagnostics-color=always -g -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-deprecated-declarations -O0 -fPIC   -o CMakeFiles/application.dir/impl/on_demand_ordering_init.o -c /home/pi/Desktop/iroha/irohad/main/impl/on_demand_ordering_init.cpp
I run preprocessor of the command (-E flag):
/usr/bin/c++ -E -DBOOST_NO_RTTI -I/home/pi/Desktop/iroha/irohad -I/home/pi/Desktop/iroha/libs -I/home/pi/Desktop/iroha/shared_model -I/home/pi/Desktop/iroha/zbudowane/schema -isystem /usr/local/include -isystem /usr/include/soci -isystem /usr/include/postgresql -std=c++14 -Wall -fdiagnostics-color=always -g -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-deprecated-declarations -O0 -fPIC   -o                CMakeFiles/application.dir/impl/on_demand_ordering_init_prep.cpp -c /home/pi/Desktop/iroha/irohad/main/impl/on_demand_ordering_init.cpp
then I've copied the file:
on_demand_ordering_init_prep.cpp
to my computer and build with command (now no includes are necessairy):
arm-linux-gnueabi-g++-8 -std=c++14 -fdiagnostics-color=always -g -O0 -fPIC -o CMakeFiles/application.dir/impl/on_demand_ordering_init.o -c CMakeFiles/application.dir/impl/on_demand_ordering_init_prep.cpp
thenI've copied the file back to raspberry:
on_demand_ordering_init.o 
and compilation continued

If you want to build a Docker image for your Raspberry Pi to run Hyperledger/iroha, you can use my repository.

https://github.com/tkyonezu/iroha-pi

First git clone Hyperledger/iroha, then iroha-pi next to it, then run make. Since the environment is determined by the Makefile, Hyperledger/iroha can be built and executed on Linux/aarch64, Linux/armv7l, and of course Linux/x86_64. 

However, when you build on Raspberry Pi 4B other than Memory 4GB, it is better to set swap to 2GB or more.

disclaimer: i have not done this. i think u need to have a block listener to get all the blocks and reconstruct the history from there. Maybe one of the core devs can help to explain?

@lebdron I believe this is connected to the fact that only current WSV is being stored, right?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 09:03:34 GMT):<br/>
*[Jeffrey van Aswegen](https://gitter.im/jeffmess)* _via gitter_
does the GetAccountAssets query under the hood reconstruct the blocks as well or does it store the current balance ?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 09:06:17 GMT):<br/>
*[Andrei Lebedev](https://t.me/lebdron)* _via telegram_
In general case, current API allows to recreate the state at a specific time by fetching the blocks and executing the commands locally, as Leo described. Sara is correct, the node allows to access the latest state, as with asset queries for example.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 09:07:42 GMT):<br/>
*[Andrei Lebedev](https://t.me/lebdron)* _via telegram_
Node stores the current balance, so that it does not have to reconstruct the state by executing the blocks each time a new proposal is verified

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 09:11:16 GMT):<br/>
*[Jeffrey van Aswegen](https://gitter.im/jeffmess)* _via gitter_
Yeah, I don't really want to rebuild state. My use case is I have a bunch of events with transaction hashes, I'd like to build a processor to take these events and query iroha for the balance at the time and store it in a readside database. This functionality would help me with past events. But if this something you wouldn't consider implementing i'll need to come up with an alternative solution. Thanks.

*[Andrei Lebedev](https://t.me/lebdron)* _via telegram_
There is no design proposal for the feature yet, so you can help us make it! :) For example, we did not consider transaction hashes as a time point, so your use case will be valuable to design the feature.

Hi all, I encountered a few oddities regarding "Create Role":
1. If I have '-' (dash) in the role name, it will fail stateless validation. '_' (underscore) is fine. Reading the docs, both should be valid [a-z_0-9]{1,32}.
2. It appears that I can't create a new role with permissions that were acquired through append role. I can create a new role with the permissions from my account's original role.

Is this the expected behavior?

I don't like cross-compilation, so everything is built and running on Raspberry Pi.
I have Iroha built and running on Raspberry Pi 3B, 3B +, 4B. Other than Raspberry Pi 4B Memory 4GB, it is better to configure swap.
Of course, docker and docker-compose are also running, but docker-compose uses the one built on Raspberry Pi.

@MaharjanSajan_twitter Hi! Sorry it took us some time, but I believe I've got an answer for you. So, to get this info, you'd need to go through the commits that contain transactions with Add asset quantity and Subtract asset quantity. To get the commits, you can use this query: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/develop/api/queries.html#fetch-commits

Hello, I have new question:
What is the easiest way of adding new peers to existing network?

I have working iroha network with few nodes and hunderds of transactions. What is best way to add next peer to existing network?
I've managed to do this with AddPeer transaction to an "old peer" and copying all blocks to new node. But is it best solution? Is it necessairy to copy all blocks?

To visualise my question I'll use example:

Lets assume we have 3 servers:
server1, server2, server3

Network between them is working and has about 1000 blocks with transactions.

Suddenly I want to add serwer4 to existing networks.

So I generate keys for new server (server4) then I send transaction:
AddPeer with:
his public key and address:
server4:10001
And it is 1001st block.

Then it is what I did, but I think it is not a good solution:
I copy all blocks to server4 (all 1001 blocks) and just run the server. Network after starting up server4 is fully working.

But it is a better way to avoid copying that much blocks?

*[Mikhail Boldyrev](https://t.me/mboldyrev)* _via telegram_
hi!
having the whole chain of blocks on each node is necessary, but you can avoid copying them yourself. the very minimum is the genesis block, which is enough to start the new peer, which then will use the peers added in it to get the rest of the chain. if the participants of the network differ substantially from the ones added in genesis block, you can set an "alternative peers list" in config file (`"initial_peers"`) that will be used until complete synchronization.

@Mikhail Thanks for reply. Just to make sure: if the new peer (server4 in my example) is in genesis.block it is enough to copy only the first block. But when the new peer is not in genesis block I need to copy blocks from beginning until a block in which the new peer has been added?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 28 May 2020 06:32:39 GMT):<br/>
*[baziorek](https://gitter.im/baziorek)* _via gitter_
And to make sure about the option initial_peers:
When in genesis block I have only server1 and server2, then in blockchain I have server3 (lets assume in block 500) and I added server4 in block 1001. So it is enough to copy only genesis block and use in config for new node (server4) nodes:
"initial_peers" : [
        {"address":"server1:10001", "public_key": "4e7b38bbca612e166cad8b0db096254b86b99a6f1f8ac92289af381bbdd290e8"},
        {"address":"server2:10001", "public_key": "a4ab794040604ba5993ee33fbb526163744e2046b65f1b6a17c53450608e0bac"},
        {"address":"server3:10001", "public_key": "fdc06417abd8c5e7beb2c2930250f3e203956e3bb7671b19e608424dfbc7cb5e"}]
}```?

baziorek,

1. if the peer is in the genesis block, is it any newer than the others? I only answered the question about adding a new peer, which implies it was not there before. of course it could be removed and then readded, but that makes no difference. when you add a peer, it has to have a subset of the blocks from the running network, starting with genesis and subsequently increasing. the minimal subset is the genesis block.

2. yes, that should be enough.

About configs - are any plans to make length of account name configurable? Now it is `[a-z_0-9]{1,32}`, but it would be usefull to make this longer. E.g. I want to have nicknames generated with `md5sum` from private data, unfortunately md5 has 33 characters.

this may happen if the default role of the new domain contains some permissions that the account creator does not have. it is a protection from gaining new permissions: if this case would be allowed, account creator could create an account that would give him more permissions than he had.

a question here--- when a new user is created in Iroha, the keypairs are generated in the iroha/example folder without encryption. How can iroha ensure fidelity that the key-pairs will not be misused by users who have access to the folder?

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 01 Jun 2020 15:42:33 GMT):<br/>
*[Mikhail Boldyrev](https://t.me/mboldyrev)* _via telegram_
the creation and management of account keypairs are out of scope for iroha core. do you use some client library or your application to create these keys in the `example` directory?

There’s no requirement for the keys to be kept in that directory. Like the Sora app, it keeps the key on the user’s mobile phone

I am new to IntelliJ and I am trying to get the GIT repo https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-java To work on IntelliJ. I finally got all lombok working. But now when I run Example1 I get the following error:

Process 'command '/Applications/IntelliJ IDEA CE.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home/bin/java'' finished with non-zero exit value 1

I am wondering if its just because I am not using IntelliJ properly. To run Example1 I click on the green run arrow inside Example1 which is on line 14. 

I have not edited the repo at all (yet) just want to get it working first. I have done some IntelliJ tutorials which helped but some guidance would be greatly appreciated.

When I click on gradle build I also get an error of

Caused by: java.lang.NoSuchFieldException: $jacocoAccess

no idea what that means... thanks for help! -Emily

To run irohad natively on MacOS, you need to build irohad from scratch

*[Eslam Farid](https://t.me/eslamfarid)* _via telegram_
There’s a difference between the Iroha network which consists of multiple peers, and how client devices interact with the iroha network.
The good thing about Iroha is it has the mobile clients in mind from day one, so that it’s easy for developers to build applications and use cases easily to end users.
As for Iroha peers itself, a C++ in V 1.x is a good choice for performance, in V 2.x it’s even better with Rust.

Hello All,
I'm frequently facing problem with commit on my irohas' nodes. Currently I have 3 nodes communicating with each other. I have also regular auto-transfer transaction every 15 minutes (it is value from energy counter). After reseting all nodes everything works fine for some time.

Unfortunately after some time transactions are not commited - everything I see is from code ([Python Iroha SDK](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python)) is:
```(ENOUGH_SIGNATURES_COLLECTED, 9, 0)
```those codes in more verbose form are:
```status_name:ENOUGH_SIGNATURES_COLLECTED, status_code:9, error_code:0 (OK)
```
is is status from (https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python) returned from:
```for status in net.tx_status_stream(transaction):
    print(status)
```    
In normal situation aftes short time I see:
`ENOUGH_SIGNATURES_COLLECTED` then `STATEFUL_VALIDATION_SUCCESS` then `COMMITTED`.
But in my case I see `ENOUGH_SIGNATURES_COLLECTED`, then after 5 minutes I have set up timeout to detect that kind of problems.

*I've posted here lots, now I'll try to describe my problem in short words:*
I have now 3 computers in iroha network (iroha version 1.1.3), they see each other through VPN ([ZeroTierOne](https://zerotier.com/download/])). Sometimes connection between nodes does not work for short time (max few minutes). Then after nodes start to see each other again transactions are not being commited - after sending transactions from python SDK I see status:
(ENOUGH_SIGNATURES_COLLECTED, 9, 0)
then the python script is holding entire timeout (I have timeout 5 minutes long) without any status change. That situation can take few days, then one or more instances of `irohad` shutdown (not all three). After I start the instances one big block of all transactions is being commited.

So in that situation question is if I can do something to make sure that nodes would start commiting transactions after internet connection between them will be available again? E.g. it is something I can do in config file? (now I have `"mst_expiration_time" : 60`) but is is not helping.

Our use-case is the food supply chain. Animal accounts are being created in the Blockchain using passport number as the id of the account. Uploading animals on the website can go wrong for many reasons and we have ability to delete them and re-upload the animals. However, this will break Blockchain as account already exists with a specified private key

I'm struggling adding multiple node to the network.
So far as I understood there are two ways to add a node.
Either at the start up adding it into the genesis.json or after start up using the 'addPeer' command.

Hello @lebdron,
yes I looked into that. But is it possible to run the example node from the documentation and then add another node to it?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 10:02:23 GMT):<br/>
*[Julian Sauer](https://gitter.im/notorious-clay)* _via gitter_
In theory I understood that both nodes need the same genesis.json and then with the simple command add Peer I can add the node1 to the network
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 10:38:41 GMT):<br/>
*[baziorek](https://gitter.im/baziorek)* _via gitter_
@notorious-clay I've managed to add nodes with those steps (if new node not in genesis.json):
1. Send transaction AddPeer to existing network
2. Copy blocks from beginning until at least block with the transaction commited to the new node.
3. Run the new node

It is also option in config:
"initial_peers" described here: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/1.1.3/guides/configuration.html?highlight=initial_peers#environment-specific-parameters
thanks to which it would be necessairy to copy only genesis.json, but I've not tried this
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 10:48:22 GMT):<br/>
*[Mikhail Boldyrev](https://t.me/mboldyrev)* _via telegram_
only genesis block is enough if there is at least 1 peer in the current network that is also in genesis. that is because nodes only communicate to other nodes in the network, and the new node only knows about the peers at some past state (like genesis block). "initial_peers" is for being able to synch with peers not present in this state.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 11:22:09 GMT):<br/>
*[Julian Sauer](https://gitter.im/notorious-clay)* _via gitter_
@baziorek sounds good, how does step 2 work. Or does the node copy the blocks automatically?
I will try out the initial_peers aswell. Thank you

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 11:36:53 GMT):<br/>
*[Julian Sauer](https://gitter.im/notorious-clay)* _via gitter_
I tryed out adding the peer in the genesis block and it worked. It seems like they can sync. But something weird happens that after I send a tx to the node0 it returns the tx-hash. When I  check the status of the tx with node0 it  gives me the response "Transaction has collected all signatures". Which sounds good to me so far. But when I want to get the status of the tx from node1 the response is "transaction was not found in the system".  What could be the issue?

*[baziorek](https://gitter.im/baziorek)* _via gitter_
@notorious-clay About Your first question about step 2 - I was copying blocks manually with scp:D.
About Your another question let's make sure I understood You: You managed to connect nodes in genesis blocks. Then few transactions appeared in blocks on both nodes. But after some time when You send another transaction to one node it was not visible by another node? I has similar problem in version 1.1.3 and earlier when internet was disconnected for short time. I remember similar problem when I was sending `AddPeer` transaction with invalid peer (it should be `url:port` not just `url`). Please provide more information

@baziorek I managed to fix the one problem. But now maybe a more common one is when I send the Tx to the Node I get the following log back: `RPC failed: DNS resolution failed`

@GiulioMariniello if you want to use iroha to track documents. The best approach ATM is to create an account to represent each document you wish to track
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 23:11:56 GMT):<br/>
*[♌︎ Leo](https://t.me/iptelephony)* _via telegram_
An account in iroha has a details attribute which you can use to store the document metadata.

If you also wish to track the circulation of the document, then you will need to create an asset type for that document as access tokens.

Hello everyone. I will be developing a major-major project for a government certifying authority in Istanbul. And i am really interested in using Iroha. The thing is there will be just two roles in the system, 1. authorities 2. people. Authorities will create assets for the people but assets will not be transferable. I guess that will be very easy thing to do with Iroha. And also i will need to set asset properties but i think just using asset name as ID and storing actual JSON properties in a common accessible public database would suffice. 

I know it sounds very primitive but it would be great to hear your ideas. Do any of you guys has experienced with a similar model?

We are considering channels for Iroha2, but it would complicate the design a lot. Instead having inter-ledger transactions and the ability to easily make multiple networks is a functional equivalence of channels for many use cases.

+1 I think it’s more important for Iroha 2 to gain more stability & performance while keeping the architecture as simple as possible.
There’s a good amount of new features already scheduled in Iroha 2, but real world performance & reliability is much appreciated IMO.

@josetupla If You are using `genesis.block` from example directory without modifications the user `admin@test` does not have permissions to create role:

can an account(public key) be in more then one domain without renaming the key files? For example admin@test account as the pub and priv key file admin@test.priv / admin@test.pub. But if I want to create "newtest" domain and I want to use the same pub / priv key file I need to copy them and rename them right? Or is there a easier way to use the same key file for multiple domains?

I'm working on system for users who use electricity, and over entire system should be available information available for reading for everybody e.g about energy providers and their prices.
And the question is what is the best idea to store information over entire blockchain? Those information should be visible to all normal users (normal I mean "user" like from [genesis sample](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/master/example/genesis.block)).
Let's ignore solution of storing all information on external server and download them through url.
Good candidate to hold information is account detail, so it should be account (e.g.: info@test) to store informations. But the problem is how to allow anybody to read (just read) information stored on the account.
It would be usefull to have `can_get_my_acc_detail` but given to all accounts over system. Ugly solution is to use "can-get-all-acc-detail" for all accounts.
Another "dirty solution" is to query database.

Any ideas?

For Iroha deployment using multiple nodes - if I'm using Docker and Ansible - I understand I can provide the IP addresses of the nodes in ansible's inventory (assume I am using AWS)
But how do I provision the machines behind those IP addresses? I'm wondering if I just need to create EC2 instances and then note down their public IP addresses, for testing, if that would be enough

I have tried a lot of times to transfer assets between new accounts and it’s always rejected. I did all from iroha-cli. I created the new accounts on domain test, created the new asset, the new role with can_receive and can_transfer permissions, I assigned the role to the new users and try the transfer. It just doesn’t work.

hi everyone, my name is oon, from 🇮🇩 (ID)
I'm interested in translation of the project (docs).

i have tried to open the poeditor, but can't find anything. (`For more information, consider getting in touch with the creator of the translation project.`)

the page on github said that `currently researching for translation platforms`.

is there any information or discussion about this?
on mailing list or else?

thank you.

Hi! Nice to meet you! 

PoEditor is not working - there wasn't a very good automation option + Hyperledger community is currently working on a new translation process in general. 
I believe it is being discussed in one of the groups on RocketChat. I'll try to find that discussion, ok?

Hello, what about compatibility between iroha 1.* versions? iroha 1.2 is fully compatible with 1.1.3 (everything what acceptable in iroha 1.1.3 is also acceptable in iroha 1.2)?

it is backwards compatible with respect to client api and previous blocks. but the WSV (contents of the database) have to be either deleted and recreated on startup or migrated with special tool. also, there is no backward compatibility with regard to inter-peer protocol - all nodes must be of the same version

Viki Val, [29 Jun 2020 at 15:02:37]:
Hey Guys,

I have a use case. 

We want to build permisioned blockchain in company for company currency (let’s call it CT).

CT needs to be integer (e.g 1,2,3) and there should be no transaction fees.

I’m considering to use hyperledger, however I’m confused which one to choose. 
I already tried Fabric, but I think maybe there could be better options.
I have some experience with ETH so Burrow could be a choice.
According to github Iroha seems like good choice. 

and we need support for JS smart contracts.

Which one to choose please?

Also I’m using MacOS (hope it’s not a problem)

Hello! 
Iroha might be exactly what you need - it is great with asset management. And if you have ETH experience, we have Burrow integration, so you could use Solidity smart contracts

Iroha doesn't have JS Smart contracts but if that's a language of your choice, you can use it as a library for building client apps. Natively, you do not need smart-contracts in Iroha at all - it has many pre-built state-changing commands to deal with assets). But if you like to use smart-contracts, again, you can use Burrow EVM that works in Iroha

Hello, In [iroha-python](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python) are few bugs, but easy to correct (wrong imports in few files).
They can be repaired in 3 minutes.
That problems are in files:
commands_pb2.py  endpoint_pb2.py transaction_pb2.py  queries_pb2.py block_pb2.py qry_responses_pb2.py 
to correct the problem is enough to change e.g.:
`import commands_pb2 as commands__pb2`
into:
`from . import commands_pb2 as commands__pb2`
So my question is - how I can report that bug, is it enough to report here, or I shuld report this on JIRA?

By the way, there are few bugs in documentation connected with smart contracts in current version here: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/integrations/index.html#hyperledger-burrow

1. Most important bug is: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/integrations/burrow_example.html# in python code: there should be instead of: 
```iroha.command('EngineCall', callee='ServiceContract', input=bytecode) 
``` should be: 
``` iroha.command('CallEngine', caller='admin@energy', input=bytecode) 
``` 

@LiraLemur I heard in one of Wednestay's meeting that You were creating documentation about Burrow

3. Another bug in documentation are names of permissions connected with smart contract, e.g. here:
https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/develop/api/commands.html#call-engine
it is in validation section:
"The transaction creator has a role with either *CanCallEngine* permission"
but such permission does not exists, it should be:
"can_call_engine"
4. Also permissions connected with smart contracts (can_get_my_engine_receipts,  can_get_all_engine_receipts, can_call_engine) are not in list:
https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/develop/api/permissions.html

Hey all! I'm having issues when creating an MST on Node js. When submitting, the promise never returns. However, when I close node js and then re-run it to get pending transactions, the transaction is listed. When I resubmit the request with the co-signer signature, the promise never returns and the pending transaction is never signed and submitted. 

I feel like I'm doing something wrong... are there any examples for MST that I could check out?

thanks for the information about how to contribute.
By the way I have another question about smart contracts in iroha, or rather about that part:
https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/integrations/burrow_example.html:
_Let’s say the contract owner (the admin@test Iroha account) wants to mint 1000 coins and assign them to himself. Recalling the naming convention to derive the EVM address corresponding to the admin@test and also keeping in mind that numbers in EVM are left-padded, we will get the following string representing the address to mint the coins to:_
```000000000000000000000000969453762b0c739dd285b31635efa00e24c25628
```
My question is how to get that hash: `000000000000000000000000969453762b0c739dd285b31635efa00e24c25628` from `admin@test`?

Hi, could anyone point me to some more detailed documentation on how to manually deploy multiple nodes? As far as I understand if I have two nodes, the first one deploys the genesis block with its own IP address in the addpeer field, and then the second node deploys the same genesis file, but besides the IP of the original node, it must add another addpeer field with its own address. Is this right?

> hi! the genesis block must be the same. you have 2 options: add both peers to it, or add one of them and then send AddPeer command to it.

So I just deploy the same genesis file on both nodes and then from the first peer I'll issue an AddPeer command to add the second peer to the network, right? And the blocks will sync automatically to the second node? Thanks for the answer

@baziorek, the hash we use as an EVM address in this case is supposed to simply be `
keccak256(id@domain)[13:32]`
 left padded with zeros to conform to the arguments encoding rules. It's a mistake in the documentation - apparently we used some other hash which is not derived from 'admin@test'. We'll fix that, thanks for pointing it out.

@alexandru-balan 
You can generate them with iroha-cli:
```echo 'localhost:10001' > peers.list
iroha-cli -genesis_block --peers_address peers.list
```and You will have pairs of keys.

Another example is to use iroha-python:
```python -c "from iroha import *; private_key = IrohaCrypto.private_key().decode('utf-8'); print('private:', private_key, 'public:', IrohaCrypto.derive_public_key(private_key).decode('utf-8'))"

Stupid question maybe, but what happens if I try to add a peer that deployed his node with a modified  genesis block? let's say he is malicious and deployed a node with an account that has "root" permission. What happens if I try to add that peer to my network?

this peer will probably decide differently on the validity of transactions. it may disagree on block validity and when it is ordering service, it will potentially propose some invalid txs and omit some valid, but as the majority of peers is correct, no invalid txs will be committed and the valid will be committed eventually.

It looks like because of chat boot problem my question disappeared:
 I'm planning to use pagination hashes in GetAccountTransactions.
But I don't see any way of getting the hashes from transactions (GetAccountTransactions don't return hashes). Is any way of getting hashes from commited transactions different than remembering all hashes somewhere?

Re Docker - in case somebody is looking for a Iroha Docker container, having Postgres 10 included too, here it is: https://hub.docker.com/r/divax/iroha (GPLv3, Source Code on git: https://codeberg.org/diva.exchange/iroha - also mirrored to Gitlab and Github). It also includes a simple process to build your own Genesis Block.

BTW: we're very interested in a lightweight Alpine based image... 😃 ... so if anyone knows some codebase...

There is also a P2P Iroha testnet with three nodes available as Docker Compose, git: https://codeberg.org/diva.exchange/diva-dockerized (GPLv3) - feedback/critics very welcome.

thank you @liralemur 

here's the text about


Building the Library

All you need now is to download build script android-build.sh to any empty folder and launch it there.

...

A couple of launch commands examples:
# build Java bindings and binary library for arm64-v8a in Release mode 
./android-build.sh arm64-v8a 27 /home/user/lib/android-ndk-r16b com.mycompany.iroha

Hi, when doing transfers, it says in the docs that I can send a description and that I need to set the maximum length in the genesis block. What is the parameter that needs to be used to raise the value of the description? Is there a link that I missed that had all the genesis block options listed?

You can set it in genesis.block like that:
```{"setSettingValue":{"key":"MaxDescriptionSize","value":"2048"}}

After that I've noticed that https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/develop/api/queries.html#get-account-asset-transactions returns list of transactions of account which assets was transferred. Is it behaviour per design, or bug?
In more details:
Account a@test granted can-transfer-my-assets to account b@test. 
b@test transfered assets of account a@test to some accounts
When i tried to list transactions (get-account-asset-transactions) of account b@test I've noticed transactions of account a@test, of course only transactions performed by b@test

Hi, I was talking about the genesis block config file that has something like this
```"block_v1": {
    "payload": {
      "transactions": [
        {
          "payload": {
            "reducedPayload": {

                      "address": "localhost:10001",
...}

it is a json-serialized protobuf block. "block_v1" is the outer field of it. meant for future incompatible updates possibility. in "payload" section we have some transactions which create the initial state of the ledger. typically they add peers, users, roles, permissions so that the network could use them in the next blocks.

This is by design. `GetAccountAssetTransactions` returns the transfer transactions where `account_id` can be transfer source, destination, or creator of the transfer. Your case is when `account_id` is the creator of the transfer.

@Parag Dulam Thank you for the video.

@Egor Ivkov When Building Iroha for the first time, in 5.3.2 of the documentation (https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/build/index.html#build-process) , I execute the lines given, but terminal gives me an error: 

`CMake Error: The source directory "/where/I/cloned/iroha" does not appear to contain CMakeLists.txt.`

I tried to remedy the issue by copying the CMakeLists.txt file from the cloned iroha repo into "/where/I/cloned/iroha," but I got many more errors; is there a different CMakeLists.txt file I should be using or should I be placing it somewhere else?  Again, I am new to this so I understand if I am missing something basic, but I was not able to figure it out just using the docs.  Thank you!

How can I create a custom asset? like a driver's license? As per the provided API (https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/develop/api/commands.html#create-asset), an asset can only have properties like name, domain and precision. A driver's license would have information such as date of issuance, date of expiration, city, country, license number, etc.

then u use SetAccountdetails
</p>
<p><strong>blueFish</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 06:44:20 GMT):<br/>
So each driver's license would be an account? I thought that DMV of each city would be an account holder and every license issued by a DMV would become an asset of that DMV.
</p>
<p><strong>blueFish</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 06:48:58 GMT):<br/>
There license issuing bodies in each major city in my country. I have been told to research the possibility of having all license's digitally signed by respective DMVs. This way, there'll be a national level blockchain-backed record of all licenses issued. This could be very helpful to identify forged licenses. Based on my two days of research into HL iroha, it seemed that each DMV could provided an account with the permission to create assets (driver's license). Is this approach correct?

In Iroha1, you should create each license as an account, then store the license details as account details. For your use case, u might want to seggregate by city. Each city can be an iroha domain, and each license is an account in that domain. Each city will also need management accounts that have permission  to create and updatte accounts in its city domain.
</p>
<p><strong>blueFish</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 07:21:08 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. That's very helpful.
</p>
<p><strong>blueFish</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 14:06:12 GMT):<br/>
Building on the DMV use case, would it be possible to have a hierarchy of domains and sub-domains? Like office1.city1.com and office2.city1.com should be under city1.com domain.
</p>
<p><strong>blueFish</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 14:08:16 GMT):<br/>
Also, it is desired that each license is only deemed valid if it's signed by the suboffice (office1.city1.com) and the city main office (city1.com). I hope this logic can be implemented using the MST facility?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 15:23:40 GMT):<br/>
*[♌︎ Leo](https://t.me/iptelephony)* _via telegram_

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 15:28:51 GMT):<br/>

MST in iroha is for transactions, not a record verification feature.

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 15:42:04 GMT):<br/>
*[♌︎ Leo](https://t.me/iptelephony)* _via telegram_
You can of course implement a license creation process that requires 2 signatures. If 2 signatures are not collected then the license won't be created. Not sure if that works for you
</p>
<p><strong>blueFish</strong> (Fri, 14 Aug 2020 15:56:28 GMT):<br/>
That sounds great. I'll look into it. Thanks.

Hi! I need a little help, I succesfully deployed Iroha on kubernetes with 4 peers and I cannot find any way to add more to it besides the addpeer function but when after I added them the nodes doesn't syncronise the sql and If there are more nodes added with the addpeer function the chain always gives reject on any transaction, because the new nodes are not in the genesis/the genesis is not the same. Any suggestions how to add peers to the chain besides restarting it with a  new genesis on kubernetes?
</p>

@alexandru-balan As I see 'GetAccountDetail' does not need pagination.
I'm sensing that query from python like that:
```        query = self.iroha.query('GetAccountDetail', account_id=account_id, key='company_name')

        IrohaCrypto.sign_query(query, self.account_private_key)

        response = self.net.send_query(query)
```

are you sure that the writer and key that you set for the first record are actually there? if not, try omitting the first_record_id, this will give you the first 4 full records and the next record id. you can use that ID to get the next page and so on

Hello, question about iroha clients - they are using TCP/IP, or they can work on different protocols? To be more precise: I'm thinking about installing iroha clients on devices which connect with RS-485 device. Unfortunately RS-485 doesn't support TCP/IP.

Short answer - no. Iroha1 uses grpc which is built on top of HTTP/2. So it's not sufficient just to bridge tcp/IP to rs-485. You need to implement a full HTTP/2 stack. You'd probably be better off to build a RS-485 to Iroha gateway. The gateway will use iroha client library to interact with the iroha network.

Hi @bobby_2hoursleep - https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/IR/issues/IR-477?filter=allopenissues is a duplicate of already existing functionality, because it lacks filters it was not mentioned on Iroha 2 boards. I will delete it.
https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/IR/issues/IR-885?filter=allopenissues will be decomposed to smaller tasks ready to be implemented soon. Wanna participate in their development?

Trying to give the iroha2-dev branch a test but after building and launching the docker file I run into the error: "error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.10: cannot open shared object file:"

I've tried debugging this in my own capacity, installing various libraries and attempting to create symlinks to patch it, but alas, no success. Any advice?

@humb1t ive been focusing on primarily python and js based things of v1.x releases. correct me if im wrong but v2 will require things to be written in Rust? for projects im busy with its been developed thusfar based on those sdks so hence asking as one is the Cli project in python and dunno if it might still be of purpose with v2's release

Hi everyone. I am evaluating to use Iroha to build a banking solution for a public bank in Central America. Basically the idea is that you can topup  your wallet using a external real bank account and then you can use the ewallet to pay inside our network. I am confused in how model the ingress of the money to the system, because in a double entry accounting system you can’t just create money, you need to justify a credit creating a debit in some way. When someone transfer real money into the system should I increment the amount of the asset (AddAssetQuantity) and then transfer it to the user OR should I increase the quantity with a big amount when I setup iroha. Can someone help with a best practice of model a baking system?

And also how can I get the balance of the account  in a specific point of time? Is it posible?  For example Can a user know what was the balance of their account a month ago ?

@Jose Daniel: I thing the solution how to keep balance from previous month is to use: (SetAccountDetail)[https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/develop/api/commands.html#set-account-detail] to store information of account balance, e.g.:
```balance_2020_January: 9324
```IHMO: it would be usefull to also keep hash of first transaction of each month, not only account balance in each month:
```balance_2020_January: 9324-196982f60563c3b2832d77dc0cf7a927f637c1e3cdd8eb661167c53792d6ed63
```it would improve speed of displaying transactions for each month

just a quick question - just wanting to confirm my understanding. if you choose to interact with iroha using jsin a clientside manner the gRPC proxy needs to run. If i understand the purpose of the proxy correct is that from client side it is still an http.1.1 request and gets passed thru to a http 2.0 connection which is what irohas nodes are woking on

If i understand the purpose of the proxy correct is that from client side it is still an *http.1.x request *and gets passed thru to a http 2.0 connection which is what irohas nodes are woking on? so the requests are not going to the nodes directly unlike using say the python libraries that do not require a proxy?

As I know Iroha Client  uses gRPC and JS grpc-web still  does not support entire HTTP/2 (as we see in https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web/blob/master/doc/streaming-roadmap.md) so the question: is HTTP/1.1 enough for Iroha Client Python to communicate or it has to be HTTP/2.0?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Wed, 02 Sep 2020 09:36:57 GMT):<br/>
*[♌︎ Leo](https://t.me/iptelephony)* _via telegram_
the short answer is no. grpc is only supported on HTTP 2. see here https://groups.google.com/g/grpc-io/c/Jk6-E3Ezb2g?pli=1 Is there a specific reason you need to use HTTP 1.1 only? Then the only option is to use grpc web.

<p><strong>bobby_2hoursleep</strong> (Wed, 02 Sep 2020 10:21:12 GMT):<br/>
if im understanding you correct - if your *client side *is written in *python* then it is gRPC. the doc you sent is for the JS lib so any interaction with iroha using js needs to be proxied accordingly. i.e. the grpc docker image supplied with the js helpers.  so to my understanding and i could be wrong depending on how you or your users need to interface with your client application the transport type/method can be anyone compatible with python. So to summarize if your writing a cli or electron type app that a user will download and all of you logic is contained client side, then http2 only can be used as your most likely using the iroha python sdk without too many custom methods. if it is a server side application in python then your client connection will be whatever you would normally use rest-json or websocket usually and would require some auth logic.

@Leo: thanks for the information. I'm working in company which is providing regular meter reading and storing that information in blockchain. Currently we are using Iroha Client on Raspberry PI, but I'm investigating what is necessairy to have Iroha client directly on energy meters without RPi.

@bobby_2hoursleep: I'm using only python client to interact with Irohas' nodes. I've only noticed that currently browsers not always supports fully HTTP/2. So because of that I've asked.

unless there is somehow a way for the meter itself to run a python interpreter with your client side iroha code i do know just how you could do it without some interface like the RPi.

@Leo: My company is now talking with multiple companies, which produce energy meters and we need to provide them minimal requirements to run iroha client on energy meters. Many energy meters provide communication through RS-485. It is rather hard to find energy meter which provide HTTP/2, even meters with SIM card just send SMSes:).

</p>
<p><strong>adtecdanj</strong> (Thu, 10 Sep 2020 22:43:42 GMT):<br/>
Here's some information I found on CMake if that makes any difference:
</p>
<p><strong>adtecdanj</strong> (Thu, 10 Sep 2020 22:44:24 GMT):<br/>
The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the CMake explains both, the legacy and new in CMake 3.13 options:

-H
This internal option is not documented but widely used by community.
and
Has been replaced in 3.13 with the official source directory flag of -S.

-B
Starting with CMake 3.13, -B is an officially supported flag, can handle spaces correctly and can be used independently of the -S or -H options.
</p>
<p><strong>adtecdanj</strong> (Thu, 10 Sep 2020 22:45:46 GMT):<br/>
So would it look like this? (cmake -S. -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -G "Ninja")

<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Fri, 11 Sep 2020 09:47:51 GMT):<br/>
Hi! So, this should work. 
But if not, there is another option, that might be used but without -S -S:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -G "Ninja" ..
cmake --build . --target irohad -- -j<number of threads>

We would appreciate if you check this and decide to contribute this fix to the documentation!

I have been looking and looking for how to configure Iroha to write the blockstore to Postgres in the `blocks` table. I find references to it and I see support in the source code. I just can't find the magic configs to  make it happen. Can someone point me in the right direction?

```CMake Error: The source directory "C:/Users/Daniel/Desktop/iroha/build/.cmake" does not exist.

```You are building iroha on Windows, but trying to perform Linux commands, try this:

Question: in genesis block,  the CreateDomain section, is the default role mandatory? In the past it seems to be ok. In recent builds of irohad, the same genesis block will stop irohad from starting.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sun, 13 Sep 2020 15:17:10 GMT):<br/>
*[Andrei Lebedev](https://t.me/lebdron)* _via telegram_
Technically it was always mandatory, as it is part of validation https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/develop/api/commands.html#id38

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sun, 13 Sep 2020 15:18:05 GMT):<br/>

In general, the only difference in validation for genesis block is that it is executed from a nonexistent account with all possible permissions

Hi all, this might be a weird one, any one thats using iroha either as a proof of concept or in production that also uses a Bi tool like Microsoft powerbi? either already integrated or planning of doing such a  project? the use-case would be data analytics w.r.t iroha transactional data

@lebdron Thanks for the tip! I also found out that Postgres blockstore is not available in the `latest` docker image. It looks like you have to be at version 1.2.0 or greater.

I understand that but at the end of that section, it says the following: ```

``` After the installation of vcpkg you will be provided with a CMake build parameter like -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/path/to/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake. ```

``` Save it somewhere for later use and move to Building Iroha section. ```
Once I moved to the Building Iroha section, I run the command: cmake -S. -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -G "Ninja" 
```

I need some help understanding the following:

I assumed that since Iroha is built on blockchain, that altering one of the blocks and then restarting the node would result in a failure to start the node. In theory, altering the block would change its hash which would result in mis-match between the calculated hash and the hash stored in the next block. I would have thought this would be validated when starting the node, but I am able to modify a block from the middle of the chain and Iroha starts up fine and in fact accepts the modified block as valid. 
Is this because I am running only one node?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 15 Sep 2020 17:14:49 GMT):<br/>
*[israel-evans-tc](https://gitter.im/israel-evans-tc)* _via gitter_
Specifically, I modified the amount in the `addAssetQuantity` and `transferAsset` commands of the block. After restarting the node, the modified values are treated as legitimate.

Is there a way to protect against this other than file permissions on the blockstore? What about multi-node networks? Would I still be able to modify the block in all nodes, stop all the nodes and then restart them and still see the altered block as legitimate?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 15 Sep 2020 17:16:53 GMT):<br/>
*[israel-evans-tc](https://gitter.im/israel-evans-tc)* _via gitter_
If I can modify blocks and they are accepted as legitimate when the node is restarted, how do I achieve immutability of the blockchain?

<p><strong>bobby_2hoursleep</strong> (Tue, 15 Sep 2020 22:04:11 GMT):<br/>
I just want to make sure I understand you correctly. When you referring to modifying a block and you are modifying a block from the node's block storage? And after modifying block height e.g. 57 and the WSV of the chain is at height 200. the node restarts, parses the blocks from storage including the malicious one and continues at height 200 accepting transactions as per norm? As  by the way you are explaining it your definitely not modifying the genesis block. So I want to try and simulate the scenario on a single node setup
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 15 Sep 2020 22:15:14 GMT):<br/>
*[israel-evans-tc](https://gitter.im/israel-evans-tc)* _via gitter_
@bobby_2hoursleep Yes, that is correct. My scenario is with a single node setup. I am not modifying the genesis block. After committing a few transactions, I modify one of the existing blocks in the node's block storage. Specifically, I change an added and transferred asset count to give an account "more money". I do not add any blocks to the storage.  Then, when I restart the node, the poisoned blockchain is accepted as legitimate. When I query for account balance, I get the new balance (minus the subtract asset transactions). I am working on an isolated repro and will post it here.

I suppose using Docker is still a best way to deploy Iroha.

May I ask you to clarify your question and your requirements to the network?

*[Vadim Reutskiy (Soramitsu ソラミツ)](https://t.me/vadim_reutskiy)* _via telegram_
You can run several containers per VM, if it have enough computation power.

Currently k8s support is not ideal, so it will be easier to run containers independently.

Amount of nodes depends on your requirements to the security and protection of the network. 4 is a minimum to reach the BFT protection of consensus

Thanks. What VM specification can you recommend? How much RAM and number of cores should be there for a standard network? I am not very experienced in production systems, that's why taking consultations

Previously what happened was that one VM got down and other was taking too much compute power... I stopped the VMs to check issues and what happened was the IPs of the VMs were changed. Due to which nodes couldn't communicate with one another. I forgot to reserve static IPs previously which caused this loss of network and now I have to re do everything so I don't want to leave an lapses this time.

to change configuration you will need to restart the node. Configuration may differ but some parameters should be the same. I will try to get the details for you

@LiraLemur  
After asking question about Quild and Iroha integration I had to ask my question in chat.
As I understand correctly video: https://youtu.be/Hzvk7TPubVg?t=181 integration is working like that:
1. accountA (in network A) is sending to accountB (in network B) through Quilt
1. First checks are being performed, if checks are successfull
1. accountA is sending to connectorA and in the same time connectorB is sending to accountB
1. but is is possible that connectorB -> accountB would be succesfull but accountA -> connectorA would be not succesfull.

So my question is - why not to do this sequentially:
1. accountA sends to connectorA and when successfull
1. connectorB sends to accountB
1. but when connectorB can't send to accountB it would cause connectorA to give tokens back to accountA
?

Not completly correct.

Important to understand that Interledger protocol contains possibility to loose founds. But to minimize risk protocol sends payment vie many micro payments. So if one of micro payments not reached destination, next micropayments will not be performed and misbehaved connector can be marked as not trusted.

If system is not decentralized anyway there will be a hole. Interledger protocol was not designed by us. So we have to use the security current design. Also I am not sure that your understanding of protocol details is correct. I think that sending still happens sequentially. If you want a deep dive into protocol I recommend you to join Hyperledger Quilt and Interledger working group. They have forum and regular meeting. I am not sure if I am able to be a real authority speaking about this protocol.

@Aswathashii If You want to run two nodes on single machine You probably want to use docker. here You have instructions how to run single node:
https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/getting_started/
Then You should try to run another node (another database container on different port) and another node on different port than default 50001 and 10001.
When succesfully You run them You can change in genesis.block from single node into two nodes and then run nodes again.

This `cmake` command should be executed from build directory created earlier, and it should contain path to root CMakeLists file.

In general, you should change directory to Iroha root, create build directory with `mkdir build`, then go to build directory with `cd build`,  generate build files with `cmake .. -D<rest of command here>`, and run build process with `cmake --build .`

Yasir  Normally in a production environment, when you have iroha nodes in your network, you would use something to receive requests from clients. e.g load balancers from your cloud provider, webserver such as nginx, etc. If you're unfamiliar with this, look up `TLS Termination` or `SSL Termination`. That would enable clients to securely send data to your network, but once that data arrive at your network, its decrypted before being passed on to Iroha's torii port.

What was done with Iroha was adding support so nodes could handle these encrypted communications directly, instead of requiring another server to stand between a node and client encrypting/decrypting communitcations.
</p>
<p><strong>lebdron</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 16:17:53 GMT):<br/>
`-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_PATH` should be without space in between
</p>
<p><strong>lebdron</strong> (Tue, 29 Sep 2020 16:18:22 GMT):<br/>
and it probably should be `cmake .. -DCMA...`, as you are in build directory now

Here: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/configure/torii-tls.html?highlight=tls#generating-keys

You would do those steps 8 times using `openssl` to generate keypairs for each of your nodes.

OTTOMH, you can use a business rule validator to limit any transaction. Create an account for the brv. for every user account, add the brv account as signatory and set quorum to at least 2. So every transaction must be countersigned by the brv account to be valid. For your use case , the brv can check the domain and cancel the transaction if it is not within a valid domain.

@Yasir In python if You want to connect you do this like that:
```net = IrohaGrpc('192.168.0.1:50051')
```so check if You don't connect different (=incorrect) way.
If You use correct arguments You need to check IPs of nodes. Are they reachable (is ping working)? If You have nodes on the same machine via docker check if network settings are correct.
If my advices didn't help You, please provide more information

we can do `binascii.unhexlify(hash)` but getting actual payload is something that's needed
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 03 Oct 2020 19:41:36 GMT):<br/>
*Yasir* _via telegram_
The objective of this is to have asynchronous system. Like transaction would be submitted in one API and its status would be confirmed via another API. So for that we can put the hash of that transaction to get the status. Its not ideal to put the whole transaction payload back and forth via the API.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 03 Oct 2020 19:41:54 GMT):<br/>

So I am trying to get a way to revert the hash back to payload so that it's status can be checked.

Hi yes that's what I needed. Thanks. But this would add two requests per API which would slow things down a bit. So I edited the iroha-python sdk and have packaged it along with my app. Now its working well. Thank you all!

hi iroha devs, is there a limit in the block size? I just encountered a condition where iroha actually got stucked after enough sigs were collected. The only clue i have is the previous block written, is the largest block in the system. The size was 7.3MB. I suspect the unwritten block may be bigger than 7.3MB.

hi! there should be no such thing as direct block size limit. indirectly, it is limited by the number of transactions in proposal. to address the symptoms you described, we need extensive iroha logs, i.e. with debug log level, the more the better.

hi, looking for a doc that compares+contrasts Fabric and Iroha. From what I read here (https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/overview.html#what-are-the-key-features-of-iroha) it seems quite difficult. The first item is based on upon the use of YAC vs. perhaps use of Raft in Fabric which is more generally known/understood. Are there any pointers to documents RE scalability performance, e.g. Fabric's channel architecture vs. Iroha's architecture etc?

Hello! Iroha and Fabric are different, that's true :) we do not have such documents as we did not do a lot of comparison (maybe someone else in the community could probably help you with that). 

Let me try to find some Iroha performance information for you - so you could check it out (but again, these are 2 different technologies, I am not sure they are generally comparable – one may work better in some cases and the other - in others )
</p>
<p><strong>GBECBWP</strong> (Wed, 07 Oct 2020 13:51:46 GMT):<br/>

I understand. But maybe that is why they are both in Hyperledger – they are different. Iroha is easier to start with and easier to configure. One of the strong features is easy to use asset management, for example. Iroha does not have channels, so in a way it is a classic blockchain.

iroha maintainers, i have a question about branch support/1.1.x. Does this version support block storage in postgresql? My working config file omits ‘block_store_path’ to store blocks in db. When I use the same config file with the irohad built from the latest commit on branch support/1.1.x, it reports error. `terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
  what():   has no key 'block_store_path'.

@mboldyrev lately, it’s very tricky to compile from master, due to the pybind11 dependency. I still can’t link it properly on Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04. So far, I’m only able to get it to link correctly on macOS and Debian on Pixelbook

Hey, checking back with the Iroha community, has anyone actually looked into this issue I found where the immutability of the blockchain is not respected and can, in fact, be manipulated in an un-traceable way. Just change the block file, without modifying any hashes or signatures and the modified blockchain is accepted as legitimate even though it should fail hash comparison. Rebuilding the World State View MUST re-compute the hashes and validate them against the hashes in the blocks or it can't be trusted.

Until there is a resolution to this, I cannot go forward with Iroha as a technology choice.

My next question is, do you have any tests that validate this issue is fixed? I think it would be in the best interests of the project to have a suite of regression tests that attempt to naively attack the blockchain in ways that "shouldn't be possible". I found this issue because I needed to demonstrate in a concrete way how storing transactions on a blockchain is more secure than storing them in database tables. I picked an attack that should never have worked.

From a developer perspective: "Iroha: small & smart is beautiful". IMHO: Fabric wants to be able to solve all challenges in the universe - and this is, at least in my world, rather a difficult approach. You could start here: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/overview.html

@1337 are You building on Raspberry Pi? Those steps and hacks are necessairy only for RPI, not for PC build. For PC try just:

but if You are building on RPI please tell me on which file You are stucking?

Hi! I asked around a little and it seems to be dependency management issue. If you use Gradle, it should choose the appropriate version automatically, and if Maven or something else you need to directly indicate the version: com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java:3.12.2

@Konrad Baechler Is it possible to provide password to database in Iroha explorer: https://codeberg.org/diva.exchange/iroha-explorer

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Wed, 28 Oct 2020 06:33:34 GMT):<br/>
*[Konrad Baechler](https://t.me/konrad_baechler)* _via telegram_
In the current version of the explorer (v0.4.1) the postgres username and password gets read from the Iroha config. The config is stored in the "data/" folder of your iroha installation. One caveat in this version: the config must be named "config-P2P.json". Quick work around: You could create a symlink called "config-P2P.json"  pointing to your real config...

I'll fix the handling in an upcomign version (next few days).

Yea, if You really need to have iroha on docker on RPI, You need to pull: `docker pull ubuntu` then after running the machine and attaching console You should follow steps as here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64263527/installing-iroha-on-raspberry-pi-4/64371262#64371262. You also need to perform some extra steps (expose ports, probably also share host directory for blocks)

But when building on RPI there needs to be performed extra steps (and hacks). It was described on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64263527/installing-iroha-on-raspberry-pi-4/64371262#64371262 how to build iroha without docker on RPI.

@LiraLemur Some time abo we were talking about adding to documentation instructions how to build on RPI. I've check recently building Iroha 1.1.3 on PC and I've noticed that some of described steps for RPI needs to be done also when building for PC (problem with grpc in iroha 1.1.3 and instaling). So I have idea to add wiki page here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/iroha/Instructions with name "Iroha building problems". At the new page I'll provide instructions how to build despite those problems iroha 1.1.3 on PC, but in documentation we will only provide link to the page. And also provide to documentation steps specific to build on Raspberry Pi. What do You think?

@lebdron Short question re async_grpc_client.hpp/struct AsyncClientCall (v1.2rc2) - there is no timeout defined for grpc::ClientContext - so it seems to use a default of 10000ms (at least according to my logs). On slow networks this leads to "[Irohad/AsyncNetworkClient]: RPC failed: Deadline Exceeded". Is there a config param planned to influence this default timeout?

_________________
I have another question, this time abount multisignature transactions.
Is it possible scenario like that:
1. a@test sends few assets to b@test with quorum 2 signed with single key
1. b@test (on different computer) lists not fully signed transactions to himselve and see transaction from a@test
1. b@test sign the transaction from a@test, and also receives tokens send by a@test

From my tests (iroha 1.1.3) it looks like it is necessairy to create bath-multisignature transaction (first from a@test and second from b@test) in order to allow b@test to list transactions from a@test. 
On the other hand documentation suggests that it should be possible with only transaction from a@test "With the support of multisignature transactions it is possible to maintain a fund by many managers. In that scheme investment can only be made after the confirmation of the quorum participants.".
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 07 Nov 2020 14:34:10 GMT):<br/>
*[♌︎ Leo](https://t.me/iptelephony)* _via telegram_
i suppose you could say these are two different use cases.
1. b@test is countersigning a transfer started by a@test. In this scenario, b@test is not a signatory of a@test. So, it won't be able to sign on behalf of a@test. Hence the need of a second transfer from b@test to a@test. I call this the acknowledgement transfer.
2. For the fund manager scenario, suppose I create a master account called group@test with quorum of 2; a@test and b@test are both added as signatories of group@test.
When a transfer from group@test to say c@test, it will only pass if both a@test and b@test sign the transaction.

This is from my personal experience and understanding, I may be wrong.

Grpc is required to interact with iroha network. The only difference between node.js and browser, is the latter requires a grpc web proxy as well.

Hi, everyone.

I am trying to deploy an Iroha network where nodes will be added later. Initially the network will consist of a single node and then another node will be added. This new node must be connected with the previous one to receive all the information of assets that have been created previously and from that moment on.

What I do right now is to display a node with its public address) in the "addPeer" instruction of the genesis. Then, I copy that genesis to the machine where I am going to display the new node and, using the same instructions (changing the name of node0 to node1 and generating a .priv and .pub), I launch the new node.

After that, in the old node I execute the "addPeer" instruction with the location of the new node that is being added.

The nodes seem to synchronize. When I execute a transaction on the old node, the new node looks something like this:

I understand that they are synchronised, therefore. However, in the new node I am not able to access the assets that I had previously defined and that I now define in the old node. The transactions that I now create in either node appear with the status "Transaction has collected all signatures".

Hi everyone!
I have updated the genesis block file by adding some more permissions to each role and by changing the name of the roles and accounts. After that I have run the Irohad command which usually configure docker.config and genesis.
When I execute the command, it shows me the error: unable to parse genesis block..

MY QUESTIONS ARE:
1. Can I make changes to the genesis block file before starting the network?
2. If not, then what should I do to add more permission to a role?
3. If yes, then is there any other file which I have to update as well?


Waiting for the response!

Hi! You need to run the second node with modified "initial_peers" config parameter, as the second node that you start is not aware that it is a part of the network, if you start it with the genesis block only.

If you know how to connect flutter front-end to python backend then it's simple, iroha provides python libraries. Or you can use any other language.

@Leo I've checked what You told:
> For the fund manager scenario, suppose I create a master account called group@test with quorum of 2; a@test and b@test are both added as signatories of group@test.
When a transfer from group@test to say c@test, it will only pass if both a@test and b@test sign the transaction.

And I'm not sure if it is working like that, please advice me what I'm doing wrong:
1. I've created accounts:

    1. group@test with signatories as a@test and b@test only and quorum = 2
1. (code below) Then I've created TransferAsset transaction from group@test -> c@test, creator was a@test, signed with a@test
1. Only a@test can see that transaction as pending, so only a@test can sign, but b@test can't list the pending transaction

I'm trying to reproduce scenario from documentation: "With the support of multisignature transactions it is possible to maintain a fund by many managers.

@LiraLemur: About describing how to build Iroha on Raspberry Pi - I've compared building process of branches on PC:
    git clone --branch support/1.1.x https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha.git
    git clone --branch support/1.2.x https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha.git
and in branch support/1.1.x it is problem with building dependencies with vcpkg, but in version support/1.2.x the problem is fixed.
So I think I'll not describe how to avoid the bug in version 1.1.x. By the way I've created JIRA (https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/IR-925) to repair the building process (it is repaired in version 1.2.x so it should be fast to correct this, I think only change version of GRPC  1.21.1-1 ->  1.31.1).

Hi everyone! 
For creating new account and generating their key pair, we use:
iroha-cli --new_account --account_name accountname@domain

By default there is one node in the network. Is there any command to create a new node in Iroha?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sun, 15 Nov 2020 15:26:56 GMT):<br/>
*[Konrad Baechler](https://t.me/konrad_baechler)* _via telegram_
Short version: no.

Long version: I assume you worked through this: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/getting_started/index.html (Iroha >= 1.1.3 -> one fully operational node at your side on your local network). To keep it really simple (and this is rather conceptual): do the same thing on another host on your local network. Now you have TWO iroha nodes running on your local network. Last step: use the iroha-cli on one peer and register the other peer with its address (on your local network, port 10001 *must* be accessible) and with it's public key (see also: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/develop/api/commands.html, 9.3.1.2. Add peer) .

It might be beneficial for you to become familiar with docker compose. Docker compose helps creating a local network of Iroha nodes within docker containers... as it's done here (just an example - your mileage will vary): https://codeberg.org/diva.exchange/iroha/

    1. a@test, private key: 6bab97b31e93e4e9252f4d56f8b3474aa4ffce835c5c842132002c7295180df1, public: 805ee02d6d0726cde547f8cb3143788450774712e603b5606dd2405b567344dd
    1. b@test, private key: 6bab97b31e93e4e9252f4d56f8b3474aa4ffce835c5c842132002c7295180df1, public: 805ee02d6d0726cde547f8cb3143788450774712e603b5606dd2405b567344dd
    1. c@test, keys do not matter
    1. group@test with signatories as a@test and b@test only and quorum = 2
1. Then I've created TransferAsset transaction from group@test -> c@test, creator was a@test, signed with a@test
1. Only a@test can see that transaction as pending, so only a@test can sign, but b@test can't list the pending transaction

All my code is here:  https://gist.github.com/baziorek/0b8e6b0a09cff65eea3abb07ac5b11a7

Please, could You (or anybody) advice me what I'm doing wrong? I'm trying to reproduce scenario from documentation: "With the support of multisignature transactions it is possible to maintain a fund by many managers. In that scheme investment can only be made after the confirmation of the quorum participants.", but on different machines (remotely), or maybe it is impossible?

By the way I'm not good with cryptography, so I need to ask: is it possible to generate ed25519 private key from text (from the same text always the same key). I meen if somebody does not want to store private key somewhere but wants to generate its from e.g. name, surname, address etc. It is possible? I know that it can be not as secure as keeping private key, but it would be good option (it would be possible to remember text instead of private key).

```import binascii

@liralemur About my changes in documentation -I'm still working on this. Alpha version is here:
https://github.com/baziorek/iroha/commit/f6594e2d833d3e40a5f0f2e6250cc7e97634fbd1

I will also create wiki page here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/iroha/Instructions with common problems of building some versions of iroha (e.g. https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/IR-925) and refer the page from my changes.

Some code wrapper needs to be added (big code here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=41584046&src=contextnavpagetreemode), so I thing about adding this in extra place:
`/path/to/iroha/code/iroha/utils/cc_rpi_wrapper.cpp`

db schema may change between iroha versions, and it seems reasonable to drop the db and create it from scratch when we do not reuse the wsv state. otherwise, if schema expectations were not met, there appear errors that may be not so evident. when we do reuse the wsw state, we use the migration script and schema version checks.

Hi! I am giving a try to Iroha, it looks a great piece of software, thanks to the people working on it.
I am having an issue: I am trying to run the example provided in the iroha repository in a machine (with a single node). No dockers, Ubuntu 18.04LTS. Unfortunately, I am not being able to see the voting process moving on:

I have been trying to figure out what the problem could be but I am not being able to solve it. Any suggestion? 

Thank you very much in advance!!

Initially I thought it could have to do with the fact of only having one node, but according to this sandbox: 
https://www.katacoda.com/lebdron/scenarios/iroha-transfer-asset 
it seems to be possible. 
P.S1: I think the previously linked Sandbox does not work, since when trying to execute the python scripts the iroha module is not found.
P.S2: The "tab" in the top of the page: https://soramitsu.co.jp/iroha   linking to resources does not work in Google Chrome (one has to scroll manually there).

Hi Konrad, thanks for your answer!
I am using the files given in the Iroha repository example. 
In the original genesis.block file, where the peer is added, the peerKey is set to be the one from the node0.pub file.
Nevertheless, I saw that in the VoteMessage appearing in Irohad, the Signature PublicKey is the one from test@test.pub.

If I change in the genesis.block the peerKey to be test@test.pub, it (apparently) works. I am actually confused by this, since I thought the voting process depended on peers and not accounts. Why does Irohad use the test@test.pub and not for example admin@test.pub account?

Once I do that modification, the following appears, so it seems to work although not new blocks are added (since there is not transactions???):

...Ordering/Service]: onCollaborationOutcome => Round: [block=2, reject=1813]
...Consensus/HashGate]: Order for voting: [127.0.0.1:10001]
...Consensus/HashGate]: Vote VoteMessage: [yac hash=YacHash: [round=Round: [block=2, reject=1813], hashes=VoteHashes: [proposal=, block=]], signature=Signature: [publicKey=716fe505f69f18511a1b083915aa9ff73ef36e6688199f3959750db38b8f4bfc, signedData=92426b036d1ab16c72f85ff6b97adfe2a822b333f6097b416402fdb0971a8b792fe0123447593bfaf3e625421f048b25539650f6368dbddeac56aa47417f3505]] to peer Peer: [address=127.0.0.1:10001, pubkey=716fe505f69f18511a1b083915aa9ff73ef36e6688199f3959750db38b8f4bfc, tlsCertificate=0]
...Consensus/Network]: Send votes bundle[size=1] to 127.0.0.1:10001
 ~~~~~~~~~| PROPOSAL ^_^ |~~~~~~~~~ 
...Consensus/Network]: Received votes[size=1] from ipv4:127.0.0.1:32910

...Consensus/VoteStorage/ProposalStorage/BlockStorage]: Vote with round Round: [block=2, reject=1738] and hashes (, ) inserted, votes in storage [1/1]
...Consensus/HashGate]: Received supermajority of votes for Round: [block=2, reject=1738], skip propagation
...Consensus/HashGate]: Pass outcome for Round: [block=2, reject=1738] to pipeline
...Consensus/Gate]: Consensus skipped round, voted for nothing
...Synchronizer]: processing consensus outcome
~~~~~~~~~| EMPTY (-_-)zzz |~~~~~~~~~ 

After that, when trying to interact with the blockchain following this guide:
https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/1.1.3/getting_started/cli-guide.html
I get this:
[CLI/ResponseHandler/Grpc]: UNIMPLEMENTED
Congratulation, your transaction was accepted for processing.
Its hash is c5cb317271240b7be5908473b002f3ab0fb085aff933719ec9274b6a37d36ce3

But it was not processed, I don't think nothing was shown in Irohad and no new blocks were created.

What am I doing wrong?

Thank you very much in advance!! Once I have a better understanding of Iroha, I could contribute to create some additional documentation addessing some of the issues I am facing being new to this technology.

"the voting process depended on peers": yes - and messages traversing the network must be signed by the sending peer with the correct key 😁. Accounts are not involved in voting. The "problem" (=irritating for new users) is rather the "iroha-cli" tool to create key pairs. The naming of the option "-new_account" is kind of misleading (since the tool can be used to create keys for accounts AND peers).

Before I'll try to create some docker-compose /docker containers to reproduce this again - I have one question: is the locally available timestamp of an iroha 1.2.0-rc2 peer of any relevance? Or, asked the other way round: assume one specific iroha 1.2.0-rc2 peer is NOT in sync with a reliable NTP and its local clock is wrong - will this create any synchronisation/validation problems between the peers?

Hi! Iroha has some preset commands and queries (they are like an equivalent of a contract in other technologies, I believe) but it also has an integration with HL Burroe which allows to use Solidity contracts. I can point you in direction to both in the docs. Which one would you like?)

Thanks. Running Iroha without docker is a real struggle. 
I am learning how smart contract in Iroha works. I am thinking of setting up a simple smart contract ( for the purpose of learning).  So I would really appreciate any method that’s simple.

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 24 Nov 2020 20:45:08 GMT):<br/>

Yes in the Docs the commands and queries are mentioned. But it’s not clear how to execute them especially without docker. Or where really the smart contract resides.

*[Sara](https://t.me/liralemur)* _via telegram_
Well, the thing that you've built is basically the 'core' part of Iroha. To send something there (including the commands and queries) you will need some sort of a client side. 
For example, you can try CLI (although it is only for trying things out - it is not sonething for actually building stuff and not exactly reliable) here (https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/getting_started/cli-guide.html) or use Python client library - a little guide is here (https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/getting_started/python-guide.html). Bonus resource for Python is a Katacoda tutorial: https://katacoda.com/hyperledger-iroha where everything is shown step-by step. 

Burrow smart-contract business is trickier. First of all, you will need to build Iroha again with Burrow flag, and then carefully follow this part of the documentation: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/integrations/index.html#hyperledger-burrow

I would start with Python example just to get the idea of what the system looks like.

I am new in here, I am confused on setting up configuration ports, peer communication and block store on a multiple nodes situation.

I was able to compile the master on a Windows 10 Ubuntu 18.4 (WSL).   I want to run two nodes on the same machine. Following are my configuration and setup..

Node0’s config has 
•	internal_port = 10001,   
•	"torii_port" : 50051,
•	"block_store_path" : "/tmp/block_store/"

Node1’s config has
•	internal_port = 10002,   
•	"torii_port" : 50052,
•	"block_store_path" : "/tmp/block_store2/"

The genesis.block for both has
"peer":{
                       "address":"192.168.1.55:10001",
                       "peerKey":"…."
              },
 "peer":{
                        "address":"192.168.1.55:10002",
                         "peerKey":"…."
              }

I am able to run both and can use “ iroha_cli”  to create asset, add asset and query asset.
However, if I created an asset1 with peer node1, I will not able to query the asset1 on the node0
If I created an asset0 with peer on node0, I will not able to query the asset0 on node1.
When I look at the /tmp/block_store and /tmp/block_store1
I can see 2 blocks on each store, the node0, /tmp/block_store has the 000000001 and 0000002 blocks, and the node1, /tmp/block_store1, I have the 0000001 and 0000003 blocks. 
In my mind, both stores /tmp/block_store or /tmp/block_store1, should have 3 blocks as 000001, 000002, and 000003.
Am I doing some wrong in the configuration (config, and genesis.block)?  Or should I use the ‘iroha_cli’ to issue the add peer/node as well.
Thanks for all your help.

I'm thinking about how to implement auction in Iroha.
The best possibility I see (in current functionalities) is:
1. create auction account e.g:
```1234@auction
```1. everybody who wants to participate in auction would transfer 10% of offered bid, but in sucject would be 100% of price and another details.
1. This account would have quorum 2 - one of keys would be public to read bids by everybody, but another would be key of owner.
1. If somebody see that another person is beating him -it would be possible to add another transfer with different 100% price offered. Bids from the same person would be accumulated.
1. After some time bids, which does not win would be returned to senders.
1. If winner does not add 90% - his deposit would be lost.

What do You think? Does anybody has better idea?

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 27 Nov 2020 08:21:26 GMT):<br/>
*[♌︎ Leo](https://t.me/iptelephony)* _via telegram_
Just an alternative idea:

1. Create a new account `validator@auction`
2. Add public key of `validator@auction` to all bidder accounts
3. `validator@auction` should maintain a list of bidder accounts it needs to check
4. Each bidder, will bid by initiating a transfer of the full bid amount to `1234@auction`, and a *quorum of 2*.
5. `validator@auction` will collect pending transactions from all bidders, maybe at a fixed time interval (e.g. at the end of the bidding round).
6. `validator@auction` will evaluate all the bids, and signs the winning bid. The rest of bids will be invalidated.

I supposed u can just put 10%, and at the end of the winning bid, the winner will need to make a transfer of the remaining 90%

@Leo, thanks for Your idea - it looks good. But the problem I see is that biders would not see offerds not done by them, so they wouldn't be able to change their bids. The solution I see is to copy bids to e.g. `1234@auction` as key-value and everybody would be able to see offers. What do You thing?

There's no official rust client for iroha v1, I suppose it should be quite straightforward to compile the grpc definition files to generate a rust grpc client. On a separate note, Iroha v2 is being developed in rust. Not due to be released until somewhere next year.

Currently assets are the same, so they cannot have information on each asset (like you cannot have any information on, let's say, a dollar - it's just some value). But such scenarios are usually conveniently realised using accounts and account details.

Hello all, can someone help me fix this problem? I followed all of the steps in https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/build/index.html to build a 64-bit iroha and the first error was Gtest cannot be found.  I tried setting GTest_DIR to vcpkg\buildtrees\gtest\x64-windows-rel\googletest\generated and vcpkg\buildtrees\gtest\x64-windows-dbg\googletest\generated which generated the following error:

CMake Error at cmake/dependencies.cmake:18 (find_package):
  Could not find a configuration file for package "GTest" that is compatible
  with requested version "1.9.0".

  The following configuration files were considered but not accepted:

    D:/Github/testing_area/vcpkg/buildtrees/gtest/x64-windows-rel/googletest/generated/GTestConfig.cmake, version: 1.10.0 (64bit)

@NoFace: please provide commands which You used. I assume that You were using Windows, so You need steps for Windows:
https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/build/index.html#windows-pre
but You need to provide more information

@thomasdesouza: I'm not sure, because I build on my own. But I've checked that according to documentation (https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/build/index.html#cmake-parameters) there is no parameter: `USE_BURROW` in any of file in directory:
```${IROHA}/docker
```so I assume that it is built without burrow.

funny - we had the 1.2.0-burrow docker build on our todo list for today and the branch just got committed to https://codeberg.org/diva.exchange/iroha/src/branch/1.2.0-burrow . The build is done in a container and then the binaries are copied out to be reused by others. 
Right now, the docker image gets built and will be pushed to the docker repo in a few mins. It will be in https://hub.docker.com/r/divax/iroha/tags tagged as "burrow"

the burrow build process threw an error ("protoc-gen-go: program not found") - so fixing this currently. seems as burrow has some "go" dependencies.

I have followed the steps in https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/build/index.html#windows-pre to install into my window computer.

  choco install cmake git visualstudio2019-workload-vctools ninja
  choco install postgresql

  git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha.git
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File .\iroha\.packer\win\scripts\vcpkg.ps1 .\vcpkg .\iroha\vcpkg
 
All the step above are in the documentation, and i can installed without showing error, it also successfully show the CMake build parameter -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=D:/Github/testing_area/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

when i step into the step 5.3.2 Building Iroha, i typed out the command below in powershell.
cmake -Bbuild -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=D:/Github/testing_area/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -G "Ninja"

Halfway during this building process, it appears the error below 

CMake Error at cmake/dependencies.cmake:18 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "GTest" (requested
  version 1.9.0) with any of the following names:

    GTestConfig.cmake
    gtest-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "GTest" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "GTest_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "GTest"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.

After i read inside cmake/dependencies.cmake and found out that the requested file is inside 
\vcpkg\buildtrees\gtest\x64-windows-dbg(or x64-windows-rel)\googletest\generated
So i set $env:GTest_DIR the directory above, but at the end it turns out that the version of GTestConfig.cmake in either folder is 1.10.0 and not the requested version 1.9.0 with the error shows like this

I also have a question about this command line below here, i'm not understand about the which build dir it require and what is the number of threads

yes - adding golang to the container and installing protoc-gen-go helps 😃... but now I am stuck with "flag provided but not defined: --modfile" error in goSrc/src/vmCaller/CMakeLists.txt ...

First impression: It looks like golang >1.14 is needed ... in the ubuntu:latest build container I am on 1.13.8...

Let me find the issue that the note about go was based on... Maybe it has some clues in it

*[Konrad Baechler](https://t.me/konrad_baechler)* _via telegram_
It's solved and it works now: the code to build it in a container is here: https://codeberg.org/diva.exchange/iroha/src/branch/1.2.0-burrow/. The burrow-build is available 🥳. Pushed it to docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/layers/divax/iroha/burrow/images/sha256-3f6ddfc939003560404e6b336192aeb6a927af380387063544c3c72e2e2aca15?context=explore

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 12 Dec 2020 13:13:48 GMT):<br/>
*[Sara](https://t.me/liralemur)* _via telegram_
So it was the version issue?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 12 Dec 2020 13:14:25 GMT):<br/>
*[Konrad Baechler](https://t.me/konrad_baechler)* _via telegram_
The problem was simple: "—modfile" requires golang >=1.14 and ubuntu:latest ships with 1.13.8... so it simply needed to download and configure the correct go version in the build container.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 12 Dec 2020 13:17:06 GMT):<br/>
*[Sara](https://t.me/liralemur)* _via telegram_
Cool. So no need for the additional note on that? Or better have it there 🤔

*[Konrad Baechler](https://t.me/konrad_baechler)* _via telegram_
Well, you kind of have it because you link to the official go documentation... BUT from my perspective (building in a docker container) it was not that obvious. Additionally the error message comes very late in the build process (after about an hour). So it was a bit painful.

I'm still working on trying to get burrow to work using the 1.2.x branch as the master will not build for me. I have built a version which passes all tests and works as expected with non burrow transactions. However when I use the examples from https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/support-1.2.x/integrations/burrow_example.html I get the following error: 
internal_command = getattr(command_wrapper, field_name)
AttributeError: call_engine

<p><strong>v3ss0n</strong> (Tue, 15 Dec 2020 10:46:14 GMT):<br/>
but only 1 peer able to join but unable to validate

Hi @v3ss0n . Did you check the blocks with addpeer transactions that you sent using CLI?
</p>
<p><strong>v3ss0n</strong> (Tue, 15 Dec 2020 10:55:37 GMT):<br/>
@lebdron  do you mean genesis.block file?
</p>
<p><strong>v3ss0n</strong> (Tue, 15 Dec 2020 10:55:47 GMT):<br/>
i check and nothign changed in that file
</p>
<p><strong>v3ss0n</strong> (Tue, 15 Dec 2020 10:55:58 GMT):<br/>
after adding peers
</p>
<p><strong>v3ss0n</strong> (Tue, 15 Dec 2020 10:56:08 GMT):<br/>
is it supposed to be changed?
</p>
<p><strong>lebdron</strong> (Tue, 15 Dec 2020 10:56:49 GMT):<br/>
No, not genesis blocks, but the new blocks that should appear after you sent the transactions
</p>
<p><strong>lebdron</strong> (Tue, 15 Dec 2020 10:56:49 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>v3ss0n</strong> (Tue, 15 Dec 2020 11:02:19 GMT):<br/>
is that the cause?
</p>
<p><strong>lebdron</strong> (Tue, 15 Dec 2020 11:02:31 GMT):<br/>
Oh, OK, then it is a bit complicated. Did you try sending some queries, if it was successful?
</p>
<p><strong>v3ss0n</strong> (Tue, 15 Dec 2020 11:02:49 GMT):<br/>
if its more simple i will add back block path
</p>
<p><strong>v3ss0n</strong> (Tue, 15 Dec 2020 11:03:01 GMT):<br/>
queries like? what should i try?
</p>
<p><strong>v3ss0n</strong> (Tue, 15 Dec 2020 11:03:27 GMT):<br/>
also is there a way to list how may peers added?
</p>
<p><strong>v3ss0n</strong> (Tue, 15 Dec 2020 11:03:34 GMT):<br/>
i added both by domain and ip address
</p>
<p><strong>v3ss0n</strong> (Tue, 15 Dec 2020 11:03:40 GMT):<br/>
so many now i think
</p>
<p><strong>v3ss0n</strong> (Tue, 15 Dec 2020 11:03:55 GMT):<br/>

Dear Maintainers
I need to upgrade iroha version from iroha 1.1.3 to 1.2 on 3-nodes network. There are about 40k blocks, so I'm really afraid of doing that.  I saw instruction of using Your script (https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/maintenance/restarting_node.html#changing-iroha-version-migration). But my question is - won't it work if I just rerun iroha with flags: `-overwrite_ledger=true -reuse_state=false`?

@Jack Na: I don't have access to windows now, but few months ago I've managed to build this with commands:
```    cd .\iroha
    cmake -H"." -Bbuild -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/Users/user/Desktop/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake  -G ""Visual Studio 16 2019"
    cmake --build build --target irohad --
    cmake --build build --target iroha-cli --
```of course replace path to the toolchain with Your path. I think also You need to have Visual Studio Installed with english language version.

@jack Na: Few months ago I've succesfully build iroha on Windows 7, where Visual Studio was installed. But I haven't successed to build on Windows 10 where Visual Studio was not installed. I'm not specialist, so maybe I did something wrong, but it is my experience. So You can try to install Visual Studio Community and maybe it will help. Now I can't check You building on Windows.

You asked "hello can we store arbitary data in iroha?". So I've understood its as data, which  can't be transfered to another user directly. But You can store some data in tokens' transfer. How much data depends on settings of Your nodes.

How to debug:

1. make sure your irohad is logging all details, like "trace" or "debug" level, https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/support-1.2.x/configure/index.html?highlight=trace#logging 

2. Execute your transaction again and then study the logs of irohad. Within the logs you will find more details re "STATEFUL_VALIDATION_FAILED".

3. It might be lots of things (from invalid signature to some invalid data)

Hi Alex, a few things that you should check:
1. Are all the accounts created with the correct permission to transfer and receive?
2. From your code, are you using admin@test to carry out the transactions? I can tell u have AdminPriv which I think is admin@test private key, but I can’t tell what is your masterUser. Can you make a transfer from acc@test to acc2@test?
On a separate note, you might want to use https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-javascript

Hi to all! I am trying to figure out if the Iroha is best fit for my software and I have two doubts, so I would appreciate any help :)
It's about supply chain:

Let's say company has an asset and he wants to sell it to external unknown user - Are there any field or indicator like status in the asset (so I can set it as "SOLD" for example) and of course no one cannot acquire "SOLD" assets (I am assuming I can send it random address as a workaround but I am thinking as more elegant way)?

2.  In the docker deploy project https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-deploy/tree/master/ansible/roles/iroha-docker 
There is only one postgresql container for 4 nodes, is that a good practice? I mean, isn't better for each node to have it's own postgres database?

*[Konrad Baechler](https://t.me/konrad_baechler)* _via telegram_
By design the default Iroha setup is permissioned. So you can run your *own* network (and not joining a public one). To run your own network you need your own private keys. Therefore: yes, every peer needs a keypair (public and private key).

—Granted that on a permissioned blockchain network, a peer node needs a key-pair to join.

Would a peer node to join an open source blockchain network Bitcoin also need a key-pair?

The only "public", P2P, Iroha network I am aware of is "mine" (testnet.diva.exchange operated by the non-profit association diva.exchange - all in alpha stage). And yes, if you join such a public P2P network, your peer will still hold your own keypair (which gets created manually or on startup of the peer). This here is the Iroha chat, so I won't go into further details of "public"/P2P blockchain networks 😀 - IMHO this would be off-topic.

Generally, Hyperledger Iroha is not a Blockchain network. It is a technology, framework, on which you can create your own networks. So there's no actual HL Iroha network as it is - there are others that run on the technology

Hi all, I've an Iroha instance (iroha1) and I'd like to add new peers (iroha2, iroha3) What should I do in this case?
I'm tried but with no success:
1. Create docker-compose (iroha + postgre) iroha1:50051
2. Create docker-compose (iroha + postgre) iroha2:50052
Both docker containers in the same network. 
At the iroha1, enter to Iroha's cli, trying to 15. Add Peers, and tried all combinations (iroha2:10001, iroha2:10001) - all return: transaction rejected.
iroha2 is works perfect as standalone

@Yuk I'll try to answer 1.: There are no indicators for assets to mark some of them as "SOLD". You can transfer asset to somebody with description of transaction e.g. "SOLD" but You would not know which of tokens are marked as sold, but which of them are not. If You need to remember how much assets were sold to a user you can remember that value in his account's details.
2. : You are probably right, but I don't know, it is question for iroha team

```As a result few files would be generated. One of them would be `node0.pub` and `node0.priv` - there are keys

You can also try:
```python -c 'from iroha import *; private_key = IrohaCrypto.private_key(); print(f"Private: {private_key}, public: {IrohaCrypto.derive_public_key(private_key)}");
```

Hello! Sorry if its not the proper place to ask about Fabric CA. I am having an issue with the generation of the TLS Cert (tls-cert.pem). While the ca-cert.pem seems to be fine (everything is exactly as described in the config), the common name in the tls-cert pem file does not get the appropriate value (e.g. www.example.com) but instead it has a random (?) alphanumeric value (like  j4k3gxs832119). Any ideas? My config seems fine. BTW, this is my root CA. Thanks!

Hi all!
One question! What assets are visible in the postgresql? Do we have all assets of all accounts visible - to see what belongs to whom?  In that case, why would we query blockchain - can we write simple postgres script to get the necessary data from database?

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Wed, 13 Jan 2021 12:53:34 GMT):<br/>
*[Konrad Baechler](https://t.me/konrad_baechler)* _via telegram_
Yes - to get the world state view (WSV), simply query postgres - also for assets. IMHO, the iroha blockchain (=the blocks stored on a file system) has to fulfill the needs for  "integrity, consensus, fault tolerance and being a truly distributed storage".

Cryptocurrency is the next .com bubble! Bitcoin and Ethereum will survive, like Amazon, eBay

"NBA Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban has gone through the entire period of the dotcom bubble. Today (12), he warned the public to be careful that the big bubble in the cryptocurrency market will burst at any time. Unlike the past gagging, Cuban took the Internet technology bubble 20 years ago as an example. I hope everyone will learn from it.

It looks like just after sending my question I found out (unfortunately I can't remove from all chats:D). The solution is to first create database with user as in config:
```docker run --name postgres_iroha_benchmark \
    -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
    --network=host \
    -d postgres \
    -c 'max_prepared_transactions=100'
```

```
1) Ordered batch 1 (CreateDomain, CreateAsset, CreateAccount, AddAssetQuantity, TransferAsset)

as  "transaction"?

OK, building Iroha in a docker container is a great solution. It needs a bit of setup/config though. Personally, I just know one working solution available to build Iroha 1.2.0 in a docker container:

https://codeberg.org/diva.exchange/iroha/src/branch/develop  

Clone/fork the repo and use ./bin/iroha-bin-build.sh to start your build (depending on your hardware it will take >30 mins). The final binaries are stored within the ./build folder (automatically exported from the docker building container).

To understand how it works in detail, study the entrypoint_build.sh script (there is also the TOOLCHAIN_FILE problem properly handled).

Hello,
Two question about iroha 2.x:
1. Smart contracts - will they be as burrow integration or rewritten from beginning? 
2. Transferring tokens between different networks - how it would be integrated. With Quilt (as internship project), or with different Iterledger implementation (which one)?

Would  feature 1. and 2. implemented in first release of Iroha 2.x?

Hi, burrow and quilt integrations are not planned for 2.0 release at the time. Later we might reconsider this after the initial vision is implemented. 

1. Smart contacts are done with Iroha Special Instructions, which are a custom DSL built specifically for Iroha2.

2. For interchain communication we plan to be Substrate compatible, so that Iroha2 can be used as Substrate parachain. Though it is not implemented yet.

@baziorek  seems that is the case. But it only resolves itself when I restart the stop and start the container again.
Do you know if there is way to make it so that it restarts automatically?

Use case is: I have 3 nodes running (iroha1:10001,iroha2:10002,iroha3:10003), which I am sending transactions to through the JavaScript SDK.
I’ve created a nodejs server to send these transactions, and I am running the grace-web-proxy in order to interact with it through HTTP using Postman.

If I’ve configured the NodeJS server to hit one of the endpoints (iroha1:50052), the same transaction should go to the other 2 peers, and I should then get a response saying it was committed.
But issue is, seems this will work on and off. Sometimes, the first transaction will work, but then, it hangs, and when I check, the container is stuck in a loop.

"As the first protocol for interoperability between blockchains, there will be a slightly modified version of XClaim, that we call IClaim (Iroha Claim)."

Just curious, does iroha allow credit balance for a wallet?
Let say a wallet has 1$. Yet, we're looking make a transaction 5$ out of the wallet.
Once the transaction complete, then the wallet has balance of -$4.

No, this should bring a stateless error. But it might be possible to do through some special "loan" wallet maybe.

There is no special type of wallet but I believe it is possible to create a one wallet with enough assets and transfer funds from there, while adding information to the account that is taking the loan. It's just an idea, how that might be possible to implement, so it's all about the standard commands of Iroha

Hi all, thanks for this interesting chat about Iroha. I'm working to develop a blockchain system based on iroha, I created the test network and all the test worked perfectly. Now, i want to create a custom application, for example to store personal information of the blockchain in JSON format. How can i do that? There is a way to store custom data on Iroha or it is possible to store only transfer information?

 @mendoa If You have build iroha You can generate like that:
```	 echo 'localhost:10001' > peers.list
     iroha-cli -genesis_block --peers_address peers.list
```or with python:
```    from iroha import IrohaCrypto

    node_private_key = IrohaCrypto.private_key()
    node_public_key = IrohaCrypto.derive_public_key(node_private_key
```

Thanks a lot. Another question, there is a way to store JSON file like

{
  "name": "Ivan"
  "surname":"Vaccari"
  "State": "Italy"
  ...
}

in the Iroha blockchain? I mean, i want to store JSON file retrieved by sensor with some data (the previous JSON is an example) but no associated to a specific account. Is it possible to do?

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 02 Feb 2021 13:52:04 GMT):<br/>

If you build in docker `hyperledger/iroha:develop-build`
 the path is `/opt/dependencies/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`.
master branch is outdated, so use support/1.2.x for latest version or tag with version for stable release.

One more question. I was playing with TypeScript framework and try to get peers.

queries.getPeers({
    privateKey: adminPriv,
    creatorAccountId: 'admin@test',
    queryService,
    timeoutLimit: 5000
  })

The error which I've got is: 
user must have at least one of the permissions: can_get_peers

How may I add this permission to the Admin role?

@Lasha Kava I think you have to add the permission to the admin role in the genesis.block file, then restart the node

Modern computers have lots of ram and you can buy servers with over 1 Tb of ram. Memory has gotten so cheap and big that it’s not longer an issue.

@AqeelKazmi To connect between wallet and iroha You need also GRPC web proxy. Few months ago I've copied commands to do this, but I'm not sure if they are still working:
```https://github.com/improbable-eng/grpc-web/releases/download/v0.12.0/grpcwebproxy-v0.12.0-arm64.zip
    unzip grpcwebproxy-v0.12.0-arm64.zip
    sudo cp grpcwebproxy-v0.12.0-arm64  /usr/bin/
    grpcwebproxy-v0.12.0-arm64 \

Hello,
I have question about iroha 1.x (tested on iroha 1.2 and iroha 1.1.3):
I have noticed that batch of more transactions (250 and more) are not working. After sending the process is just hanging - no blocks, no special CPU usage, nothing. Is number of transactions per single batch limited?

If not I've prepared a short code for You:
```#!/usr/bin/env python3

from iroha import _


def public_key_from_private(private_key: str):
    return IrohaCrypto.derive_public_key(private_key).decode('utf-8')


def send_signed_batch_transaction(txs, net):
    net.send_txs(txs)
    for tx in txs:
        print(f'\t {"-"_20}: Transaction hash = {calculate_hash_of_transaction(tx)}')
        for status_name, status_code, error_code in net.tx_status_stream(tx, timeout=300):
            print(f'\tstatus_name:{status_name}, status_code:{status_code}, error_code:{error_code}')


def calculate_hash_of_transaction(transaction_with_payload):
    h = IrohaCrypto.hash(transaction_with_payload)
    return binascii.hexlify(h).decode("utf-8")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    IROHA_HOST_ADDR = os.getenv('IROHA_HOST_ADDR', 'localhost')
    IROHA_PORT = os.getenv('IROHA_PORT', '50051')

    ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY = os.getenv('ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY', 'f101537e319568c765b2cc89698325604991dca57b9716b58016b253506cab70')

    iroha = Iroha(ADMIN_ACCOUNT_ID)
    net = IrohaGrpc(f'{IROHA_HOST_ADDR}:{IROHA_PORT}')

    new_user_private_key = '1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234'
    new_user_public_key = public_key_from_private(new_user_private_key)

    accounts_to_create = 250

    txs = []
    for i in range(accounts_to_create):
        txs.append(
            iroha.transaction([
                iroha.command('CreateAccount', account_name=f'test_account_{i}', domain_id='test', public_key=new_user_public_key)

    iroha.batch(txs, atomic=False)

        IrohaCrypto.sign_transaction(tx, ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY)

    send_signed_batch_transaction(txs, net)

Hi! May I see your Iroha config file?

Max batch size is equal to the max proposal size that is set in the config. Although we are probably missing printing logs that would explain that issue. Will check this
</p>
<p><strong>baziorek</strong> (Wed, 17 Feb 2021 14:27:29 GMT):<br/>
@Kamil_Salakhiev  here is my config file:
```
{
    "block_store_path" : "/home/blockchain_blocks/",
    "torii_port" : 50051,
    "internal_port" : 10001,
    "pg_opt" : "host=localhost port=5432 user=user password=nononono",
    "max_proposal_size" : 1000,
    "proposal_delay" : 100,
    "vote_delay" : 100,
    "mst_enable" : false,
    "mst_expiration_time" : 60,
    "max_rounds_delay": 100,
    "stale_stream_max_rounds": 2
}
```
as You see `max_proposal_size` is 1000 so it is much more then 250.
About logs - I have changed logging in config file that I see warnings, it is what I saw in logs:
```
[I][info][2021-02-12 11:42:06.200222790][th:29][Irohad/CommandService/Processor]: handle batch

```
and many more time the same log, despite having only one iroha node.

Hello. I am new and still learning about iroha. I'm about to use the getAccountAssets commands. 

The code is like this:
Promise.all([
  queries.getAccountAssets(queryOptions, {
    accountId: "sandy@test",
    pageSize: 100,
    firstAssetId: "coins#test",
  })
])
  .then(a => {
    console.log(a)
  })
  .catch(e => {
    console.log(e)
  })

But i get this error:
/home/sandy/code/irohajstest/node_modules/ed25519.js/lib/ed25519.min.js:5
if(q){var ba,ca;e.read=function(a,b){var c=r(a);c||(ba||(ba=require("fs")),ca||(ca=require("path")),a=ca.normalize(a),c=ba.readFileSync(a));return b?c:c.toString()};e.readBinary=function(a){a=e.read(a,!0);a.buffer||(a=new Uint8Array(a));assert(a.buffer);return a};1<process.argv.length&&(e.thisProgram=process.argv[1].replace(/\\/g,"/"));e.arguments=process.argv.slice(2);process.on("uncaughtException",function(a){throw a;});process.on("unhandledRejection",function(){process.exit(1)});e.quit=function(a){process.exit(a)};
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ^

I tried other commands/queries like getAccount and setAccountDetail and it gives the result that i expected.
But not with this commands (getAccountAssets). 
I am using the iroha-helpers (iroha javascript helpers) and working my code with Node JS.

Is there any way to fix this? Thankyou very much.
</p>
<p><strong>sandy7a</strong> (Fri, 19 Feb 2021 07:56:33 GMT):<br/>
I also tried the transferAsset commands with the helps of iroha-helpers.
My code is like this:
Promise.all([
  commands.transferAsset(commandOptions, {
    srcAccountId: 'sandy@test',
    destAccountId: 'sandy2@test',
    assetId: 'coins#test',
    description: 'testing via node',
    amount: 1
  })
])
  .then(a => {
    console.log(a)
  })
  .catch(e => {
    console.log(e)
  })

But then i got:
Error: Command response error: expected=COMMITTED, actual=STATELESS_VALIDATION_FAILED
    at /home/sandy/code/irohajstest/node_modules/iroha-helpers/lib/util.js:119:30
    at processTicksAndRejections (internal/process/task_queues.js:93:5)

The sandy@test (srcAccountId) have 100 amount of coins#test.

*Jack Na* _via telegram_
about the definition of the asset, how do i add it ? i see that there is a json column in the asset table, but for the create asset inside Iroha API reference does not look like it has the parameter to handle this json column. And also the Get asset from the query does not return the data from the json column as well. 
I would like to ask if i need these two thing, how would i deal with it ?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sun, 21 Feb 2021 19:30:16 GMT):<br/>
*Jack Na* _via telegram_
i also try too look how to store it into account details, but it looks like it not accepted to store a big value object such as a pdf file. Can i have some suggestion on a way to deal with large value like pdf ?
</p>
<p><strong>sandy7a</strong> (Mon, 22 Feb 2021 10:39:09 GMT):<br/>
Update:
This issue (getAccountAssets error) was solved by updating the iroha-helpers package to version ^0.9.3.

However, i still can't manage to get the result that i wanted from transferAsset commands from my thread above. I still get the same error (STATELESS_VALIDATION_FAILED)

Anyone knows how to fix this?
Thankyou very much.

Now i able to use this commands.
Turns out that the amount is supposed to be a string not a number.
Changing the amount to "1" fix the issues.

This error means that the transaction was not formed correctly. Please check if all the permissions are in place, that you are transferring actually existing assets and that all the required fields are there: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/master/develop/api/commands.html?highlight=Transferasset#transfer-asset

Overall, I believe that you can store rather big amount of data in account details. What issues do you face with this?
</p>
<p><strong>sandy7a</strong> (Mon, 22 Feb 2021 10:52:57 GMT):<br/>
Actually I already fixed the issue just maybe 10 minutes ago by changing the amount value from number to string. I tried using the commands with Node.js and also tested them from REST API (with Postman). And it works.

Thankyou.

the thing is i tried few hours ago , if i use string as value (with only 80 000 characters) of a key, it does not valid. But if i try with a pdf(200kb) in base64 version (as value) it is valid . That is why i am very confuse of the limitation of value.

this query is to get the record from the table Account_has_asset right ? . That table is still empty because  the asset I just created and try to add amount into an account( but failed) . 
And I also try query with GetAssetInfo, it does return the asset id that i added, but it does not affect the result that in my AddAssetQuantity that the asset could not be found , as well as the TransferAsset command also could not find my asset

i just look into the source code for AddAssetQuantity handler in postgres_command_executor.cpp, there are a few things that i do not understand.
1 . does to add an asset quantity to the account can only done by the asset creator ?
2. in add_asset_quantity.hpp if i call AddAssetQuantity command i only can enter asset_id and the amount of the asset i would like to add, but in here  i will seek for precision as well. shouldnt that have to entered into the while calling this command ? or it can handle by knowing just the asset_id itself ?

Hi all, quick question. It the root permission is able to be set for any role in the genesis block for Iroha?? I've have tried this with Iroha 1.2.0, and always get an error starting up, complaining about adding that permission

I don't think we have exact dates right now, but in general we are stabialising the current features of Iroha2 at the moment to release Iroha 2.0. I think Substrate compatibility will be in further versions - 2.x. Most probably 2.1

Irohad version: 1.2.0-rc.1-38-g1269eca1
I may be wrong, but it seems to me the 
create_asset_statements_ in the postgres_command_executor.cpp should also need to include the the conflict statement.
ON CONFLICT (asset_id)
                  DO UPDATE SET domain_id = excluded.domain_id,
                                precision = excluded.precision

Otherwise, the processDifference -> downloadAndCommitMissingBlock -> validateAndApply will fail, due to the program will execute SQL second time with asset_id (primary key) already in database.

Hello. I want to develop an xamarin/dotnet/c# application to interact with my Iroha setup.
So far I found this library (https://github.com/adachij2002/iroha-dotnet) which did not really help me a lot.
Are there any other dotnet projects? At the moment I try to connect my application with a python api.
To do so I create a json object similar to this one:
```{
    "commands": [
        {
            "command_type": "TransferAsset",
            "src_account_id": "alice@test",
            "dest_account_id": "bob@test",
            "asset_id": "coin#test",
            "description": "test",
            "amount": {
                "int_part": 20,
                "precision": 0
            }
        }
    ]
}
```which I then transfer to my api, transform it and send it to my server with:
`net.send_tx(user_tx)`
Can you tell me a more elegant way to do so? Also I want to sign the message on the device. What is the best way to do so and what exactly would I have to put into the message for it to work?

Hello Iroha Team,
Could I add optional parameter to iroha-python library to configure GRPC transaction limit?
The only place to edit is:
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python/blob/c0c7797f5724f9ca2dcf96fedce9c0f03bd5af99/iroha/iroha.py#L356
lines 354 and 356.
It is because:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42629047/how-to-increase-message-size-in-grpc-using-python
I've tested it locally (with not secure connection) and change in the code is working.

*[baziorek](https://gitter.im/baziorek)* _via gitter_
@lebdron I've bumped version to newer than support/1.1.x.
support/1.2.x has f1bef4aa7ca7e2a6ea4f5dfe4850d95fce60b431, which is from: "Tue Sep 15 02:13:33 2020"
support/1.1.x has f3db66b403840b24ea2612d09cca30a5285f5ea3, which is from: "Fri Jun 21 23:50:05 2019"
I've tried various VCPKG versions and everything is working with version: ebe505081b667a9f9a56596057f63ed20be237a5, which is from: "Mon Jan 6 15:24:51 2020".

@lebedev:in.tum.de I've checked newest version of VCPKG (which is 75522bb1f2e7d863078bcd06322348f053a9e33f from "Thu Mar 11 16:37:49 2021") and there are few compiler errors, unfortunately connected with using external libraries, e.g.:
```vcpkg/installed/x64-linux/include/fmt/core.h:1438:44: error: use of deleted function ‘shared_model::interface::Peer::Peer(const shared_model::interface::Peer&)’
 1438 |   return check<T>(arg_mapper<Context>().map(val));

If I've understood correctly today on community meeting: branch 1.2.x would be supported as master branch, but 1.1.x won't be supported. So I think it is not goot to spend too much time for branch 1.1.x. After merging my pull request I can update building instructions for 1.2.x.

Hey. Did someone here already setup iroha in the docker container behind a nginx proxy? 
My iroha container runs with tls enabled on port 55552 and uses the same certificate as nginx. My nginx config looks like this:
```server {
    listen 1443 ssl http2;
    server_name grouvies_server;
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/grouvies_server/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/grouvies_server/privkey.pem;
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;
       
        location / {
            grpc_pass grpcs://localhost:55552;
        }
}
```In my application I configured the channel like this:
`var channel = GrpcChannel.ForAddress("https://grouvies_server:1443");`

and when I try to connect I get the following error:
`Status(StatusCode="Internal", Detail="Bad gRPC response. Response protocol downgraded to HTTP/1.1.")`

As I understands it SSL Termination may be the problem. Or the iroha ssl certificate.
I read something about iroha bridges, but I am not sure how that could help.

@lebdron I've checked Your work on PC and RPI. Hopefully my work helped You a little with preparing automatic build for RPI:).
I've found some not really serious problems, but I think they are not problems for programmers who are installing iroha (comments in Your PR).

Now I'll assume that no extra steps are necessairy to build for RPI and just edit documentation.

After that it would be necessairy to try the same steps for branch `support/1.2.x` - hopefully this time I'll be able to do everything by my own:D.

1. the DM tests project was just not completed and abandoned.
2. the modular DM was done at PoC state. it was presented on some meetings with a trivial external key-value storage module on python.
3. this was a hands-on excercise for an event. i think the repo can be archived or removed safely.

hmm, and here's why:
`
git grep -A1 PROJECT.iroha 1.2.1:CMakeLists.txt
1.2.1:CMakeLists.txt:PROJECT(iroha
1.2.1:CMakeLists.txt-  VERSION 1.2.0`

because normally it should require at least a schema version bump

Thanks for answer. So if I understood You correctly project: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Making+HL+Iroha+Data+Model+Modular+for+Interoperability+with+Other+Projects is succesfull but at PoC state. So are any plans to integrate its to some of iroha 1.* version? Ot it will never be integrated?

I suggest not to remove: https://github.com/soramitsu/iroha-tic-tac-toe because it can be usefull suggestion for me as mentor of few internship projects:).

Working database could be any. And should not exist at first start, but really does not matter.
Maintenance database is used to connect to db, it must be created outside of iroha, usually it is "postgres"

Sorry to bother everyone with a complete newbie question.  I'm trying to get a build environment up and running on a clean install of Centos 7 following the instructions in Section 5 @ readthedocs.io  (I did the docker install in a separate VM and was able to test that it's installed and running in a different VM using the Iroha CLI utility.

The install the dependency instructions for building Iroha on Linux at this link don't seem to work and there are syntax errors in the build_iroha_deps.sh script.  "-C" is not valid an argument for Git.  https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/main/build/index.html#linux-pre

Line 8 in iroha/vcpkg/build_iroha_deps.sh  also throws a Git error about not being a git repository:
git -c $vcpkg_path checkout $(cat "$iroha_vcpkg_path"/VCPKG_COMMIT_SHA)

Error is:
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git

What's the easiest way to fix these issues?

Hello there,
I'm new to Iroha and I did try to send my question via matrix (which Gitter redirected me to) so.. I'm re-posting it with Gitter since I didn't noticed that matrix wasn't properly integrated 😅.

I'm trying to use Burrow with iroha to create smart contracts using the iroha-helpers package (nodejs).
Therefore, I built iroha-burrow following the docs (setting the USE_BURROW flag to on) and I'm now trying to use the `callEngine` command to create a solidity smart contract.
My issue is that i'm recieving a `STATELESS_VALIDATION_FAILED` error for my query without futher details and I'm not finding what's wrong. 🤔
Every other commands & queries that I make using the same patern seems to work just fine and this one is based on the doc examples as well.
My code is the following, with `bytecode` being a string containing the bytecode of the Coin contract given as an example in the doc ("608060405...030033") :
```js
callEngine(caller = "admin@test", input = this.bytecode) {
	return commands.callEngine(this.commandOptions, {
		caller: caller,
		input: input
	});
}
```
Thx & sorry for the newbie question

I open a test account on MVU Cloud Mining on Apr 1, 2021, and invested $16 to purchase ETH hashrate of 150 MH/s and three days later I got a return of about $24.4.
Except the cost of the package and handling fee, I earned about $8 this account.

@Jassi10000 If You want to start I suggest run Iroha node on docker:
https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/main/getting_started/index.html
then You can try sending commands with cli:
```iroha-cli --account_name admin@test -key_path path/to/keys/of/admin
```then You will see possible commands and You can send them and also check if blocks are being created.
If You want to do more You can try try better cli:
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-tui-client
then You can code Your own code (the cli above is open source, so You can see how it is working), here is library e.g. in python:

hello,
I have question for iroha-python maintainers:
I want to extract command name from transaction. Eg. from:
```payload {
  reduced_payload {
    commands {
      add_asset_quantity {
        asset_id: "coin#test"
        amount: "99"
      }
    }
    creator_account_id: "admin@test"
    created_time: 1618471599329
    quorum: 1
  }
}
signatures {
  public_key: "af2e8759f5958f629f65b0fc4c4ec1d551c6b067b08e1bc75e0fb4b3c067729b"

}
```I want to extract:
```add_asset_quantity
```I have some dirty solution:
```def get_command_from_transaction(tx):
    command = tx.payload.reduced_payload.commands[0]
    command_name = str(command).split('{')[0].strip()
    return command_name
```but I think it must be a better one. Could anybody advice, please?

I got the answer from iroha-team on priv, according to the answer new version of the function is:
```def get_commands_from_transaction(tx):
    commands_from_transaction = []
    for command in tx.payload.reduced_payload.__getattribute__("commands"):
        listed_fields = command.ListFields()

Hello everyone! I am currently learning to use Iroha and I have started to work with Iroha-Python.

As I was coding I found a problem with the queries that involve transactions. I don't really know what is wrong with the way that I am coding it, and the documentation hasn't been very helpful with this.

The problem is, whenever I try to use the commands GetAccountTransactions and GetAccountAssets, giving the account_id of admin@test, which is the account with which I have been testing all of the other functions, it always returns an empty answer.
And with the command GetTransactions, I always get only the info on the first transaction of the array. I have already checked that both transaction hashes are valid, and independently they pose no problem whatsoever.

I will post an image of my code below, pif someone could tell me whats wrong or point me in the right direction it would be greatly appreciated!

@FAltamiranoZ I thing You are reading data wrong, for me it is working:
```transactions = response.transactions_page_response.transactions
```but You have: 
```transactions = response.transactions_response.transactions

Hello Everyone,
I am Sivaram, a third-year undergraduate at IIT Kharagpur, India. I am interested in working on the project idea "HL Iroha and HL Cactus Integration" under LFX Mentorship. I am currently going through the resources provided on the project page. Before writing my cover letter, I am planning to contribute to the codebase. Since this project idea combines both "HL Cactus" and "HL Iroha," I am unsure which repository I should start. Can anybody suggest any relevant issues?

The deadline for the application is May 7th. Is it okay if I submit my application around May 4th? (After exploring the codebase). I came to know that some projects give coding assignments to shortlist the candidates after their application submission. If that is the case, I will try to submit my application earlier.

Hi all, hope you are well. Question here: trying to create transaction and send to Iroha using the BatchBuilder and TxBuilder, using the JavaScript client library.

Let's say I am sending 2 transactions, in 1 batch request.

If I sign the transactions to be added to the batch separately, I get an error talking about bad signature: Errors=[Bad signature.]]]]]
Code:         let transaction = new TxBuilder()
            .createAsset(batchTransactionRequest)
            .addMeta(irohaTxCreatorAccount.irohaAccountId, IROHA_COMMAND_DEFAULT_QUORUM)
            .sign([irohaTxCreatorAccount.irohaAccountKey])
            .tx;

Error:
errOrCmdName: 'Transaction deserialization failed: hash Hash: [e9f2587a3bc0d161cb74c0dec37e0512ae3360c268a5cabd060cbbbdf70cc198], SignedData: [Child errors=[Signatures list: [Child errors=[Signature #1 (Signature: [publicKey=ed435ba9fd350afacd62902880c967cb56fc062189208c1b19b9e0e8f75a3bc0, signedData=3c25b65f6b9bda43b1052f91ff9d3f884d2621a2af710b6bd362db62f9e7bf047db1fe2c4fb6a05bf6a7fde114cdfea01f64b3005c5ed8fbc0f58a5e40e89203]): [Errors=[Bad signature.]]]]]]',


If I sign them while building the batch of transactions, the transactions are able to go through.
Code: BatchBuilder(this.batchArrayList)
            .setBatchMeta(0)
            .sign([txCreatorAccount.irohaAccountKey],0)
            .sign([txCreatorAccount.irohaAccountKey],1)
            .send(this.commandService, IROHA_COMMAND_SERVICE_TIMEOUT)

Would anyone be aware of how to sign the transactions separately, and add them to the Batch properly?

@dominic-pa Hi! Sorry for the delay. The dev team helped me out here and shared the example of batch management in JS: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-javascript/blob/master/example/chain.ts#L38 So, the main thing why it did not work is because you first need to create a batch and only then sign it, so transactions would have correct and identical BatchMeta

*[Dominic-PA](https://gitter.im/dominic-pa)* _via gitter_
@LiraLemur no worries! Thanks for the response. I get it. So I've editing the code as such, but ran into 1 issue:

If I send 2 transactions, and sign the batch twice, I am able to get a response (whether it commits or rejects the batch)

        return new BatchBuilder(this.batchArrayList)
            .setBatchMeta(0)
            .sign([txCreatorAccount.irohaAccountKey],0)
            .sign([txCreatorAccount.irohaAccountKey],1)

If I send 2 transactions, and sign the batch ONCE, it seems to hang, and I never get a response back from Iroha. Any idea why this would happen?

        return new BatchBuilder(this.batchArrayList)
            .setBatchMeta(0)
            .sign([txCreatorAccount.irohaAccountKey],0)


I am trying to make it so that I can dynamically make batch requests, depending on the amount of transactions sent in a payload from the client (which I'm testing by using Postman)

Hi! Well, we here are all Iroha contributors. There are 2 version that are being built at the moment: Iroha 1 (on C++) and Iroha 2 (on Rust). In regards to Iroha 1, I do not think there are currently tasks regarding web development - maybe something to do with JS library? Egor will be able to tell more about Iroha 2. 

Also, it is possible that there are some projects built on Iroha that might appreciate contributions!

Hello,
I'm investigating how database is being queried by iroha to find transactions, but I can't find where are transactions made by account. I've tried to investigate the code but it is taking really long time even despite I found queries in postgres_specific_query_executor.cpp. Database as I see contains few tables (as described here: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/main/concepts_architecture/er_model.html), but there are no transactions and no timestamp of transactions. Is iroha node scanning block files each time query is being performed (I mean e.g. GetAccountTransactions)?

Hi, baziorek.
With default configuration
Database is used to store world-state-view(WSV)
Blocks are stored in block_store directory on filesystem (declared in config file)
WSV is a state cache and could be reindexed from blocks but it is a long procedure. Use `—drop_state` for it.

It is this internship project to extend queries of iroha with optional parameters (time from and time to):
https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Extend+HL+Iroha+queries+with+optional+arguments
I'm trying to find all places where to modify iroha's code. So I would like to know how data is collected by node when query  `GetAccountTransactions` comes. I was scanning database and it looks there are no transactions (only state cache), but I can be wrong so I'm asking to make sure.
Of course somebody can tell me tomorrow during bi-weekly meeting.

I've checked Your gist and make sure that `sara_jasim@Rasheed` has permissions:
`can_transfer` if it has - possibly You can't do what You want with iroha-cli (because is not supported "for years"), You need to use https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-tui-client instead.

Hello! Not sure that's the good place to ask questions but I'll try. I'm using the python client and I have a problem I cannot understand: from admin@test (role: admin) I can transfer assets to a user test@domain (role: user) but test@domain cannot transfer asset to anybody, I always get the transaction rejected despite the 'user' role has the "can_transfer' permission. Any good reason?

Hello! Not sure that's the good place to ask questions but I'll try. I was reading the example usecases and I was wondering how to implement this one:
"registered university in Hyperledger Iroha has permissions to push information to the graduated students. A diploma or certificate is essentially Proof-of-Graduation with a signature of recognized University"

I guess a PoG cannot be an asset as this is unique and not countable (in the sense 2 PoG cannot be added one to the other), is it thru Account details ? But how can it be signed ?

Thanks!

Another questions, to implement NFT like tokens, it requires Smart Contracts right? Is the only way to define Smart Contracts is to use the Burrow integration? Is the hyperledger/iroha:latest image compiled with Burrow support? When I try the Burrow example, I get a `('STATELESS_VALIDATION_FAILED', 0, 0)` when calling CallEngine with the bytecode. Is it because Burrow is not enabled?

Hey everybody i have asked this on the github too but i guess i can get a solution faster here

I have been using iroha on the cli and the python sdk for a few days now and everything works fine except that the account transactions and account asset transactions query doesnt work on both cli and the python library. On the cli it says query is stateless invalid while on python it just returns an empty list. I have tried everything from creating new domains to granting all permissions but it doesnt seem to work. I also followed the cli example given on the docs but at the end when i want to add a query for getting the transactions it gives the same error

1. [BUG?] Using an admin1 account which can has a role "admin" which create domains, accounts BUT cannot burn assets (can_subtract_asset_qty) I have created a domain "mybank" which a a default role "banker" which can brun assets. Then the same admin tries to create an account "manager@mybank" and it fails validation. The only way to make it work is to add the permission "can_subtract_asset_qty" to the "admin" role. Is it expected ?

2. [Design question] I understand that Iroha's assets can only be used to model fungible tokens. And I need to have something maybe near from a NFT, an arterfact which can be traded, updated on the blockchain. For that, I found 2 solutions, an easy one and a complex one. The easy one is to create an account for each artefact and this artefact has its own lifecycle on the blockchain. The complex one I did not start yet is to use the Burrow integration to create my own Smart Contrat. Before trying that, is the easy solution a bad workaround?

4. [API] I did not find in the API any way to list/find domains and accounts. For example, if I have dynamically created accounts in my domain (and I "forgot" them), how can I list them? Is the only possible way is to check in the WSV?

5. [Security] I understood the WSV is only a partial snapshot of the blockchain at a given point of time so if the DB access is hacked or whatever, it cannot have any "very bad" consequences rights?

Here the account one sounds a bit more fitting, to be honest. After all it's just another type of the entity on blockchain, even though it's called an account. But it's all up to you of course

@liralemur, I saw on the wiki that there is an active development on iroha2 which looks to be fully redesigned and rewritten in Rust (which is good but may takes some time). Does it mean the current iroha cpp version is going to die soon? Or at least no update?

Hello,
The batch in the example is also multisignature transaction. So it must be signed by multiple accounts (quorum=2 means by two accounts) to be committed/rejected.
If You want to understand batches and MST transaction it would be helpful:

it helped me to understand, thanks to LEO, who created the code:D.

@salakhiev Hello,
During last iroha community meeting I've asked how transactions are stored in database - You told me that they are in blocks, but in database is only index for transactions - I found everything (where it is if we use blocks and where it is if we store blocks in database instead of files).
I need to ask - on December Andrei was explaining how to add command to iroha - I have some notes from that meeting, which are useful to extend queries. But do You have original recording (I know it was recorded)? In the recording it was said that "tests are for next recording" so if there are no plans for next bi-weekly meeting, maybe somebody can explain iroha's tests (where changes in queries and commands should be tested)?

@liralemur In config documentation there is no info that one of parameter is optional, I've created documentation-related issue:

You need to check if the `admin` role actually has `can_subtract_asset_qty permission`.  If you are using the `genesis.block` from the example folder, it’s not.

Hi Leo. I figured that but why the the admin account needs to have at least the same permissions that the account it creates ? What is the logic ? Thanks !

Yes it would be. Our CI is under construction now. You should create an issue in hyperledger/iroha repo on GitHub and wait about 7 days. Faster way is to build own iroha in Docker and use it. U can found development Dockerfile in repository by path docker/develop/Dockerfile
Then vuild docker image from that file, than build iroha with burrow, there is nothing complex

Hi all! Just wanted to share some quick work I was doing while working with Iroha. May be of interest to anyone.
Just built a general REST server on top of the Iroha JavaScript library. Just a different way really to interact with Iroha, then rather from the command line.

You can find the repository here: https://github.com/dominic-pa/iroha-rest-server

You can also find a quick guide on how it was built here: https://dominic-aidoo.medium.com/build-a-blockchain-rest-server-with-hyperledger-iroha-using-nodejs-and-typescript-bef3f483c191

Feedback is appreciated!

During last iroha community meeting I've asked how transactions are stored in database - You told me that they are in blocks, but in database is only index for transactions - I found everything (where it is if we use blocks and where it is if we store blocks in database instead of files).
I need to ask - on December Andrei was explaining how to add command to iroha - I have some notes from that meeting, which are useful to extend queries. But do You have original recording (I know it was recorded)? In the recording it was said that "tests are for next recording" so if there are no plans for next bi-weekly meeting, maybe somebody can explain iroha's tests (where changes in queries and commands should be tested)?

@liralemur In config documentation there is no info that one of parameter is optional, I've created documentation-related issue:

@lebdron  @liralemur
Sorry, I'm afraid that because of my english I was not understand correctly during the meeting and now You probably think I'm yokel. It is not that I really needs the pull request: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/864#pullrequestreview-615927884 in May. The PR is necessarily for my PR https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/728. I wanted to say that I would like to complete the issue connected with documentation how to build iroha for Raspberry Pi before June. Because of helping interns with their projects June-August, I'll not be able (probably) to complete the my task to describe building on raspberry pi. What I want to do is to "migrate" PRs 864 and 728 from branch `support/1.1.x` to `support/1.2.x`. It would be really hard because Lebdron made advanced code magics. But I hope to do this by my own.

Of course if You have lots of work (release, feature developments) it doesn't have to be in May, it can be later. But the later it is the harder the task became. I just wanted to remind:).

Hello there! I'm trying with the python client to create multi-signed batch transactions but it doesn't work and I don't find why (and the example in the python library fails too), can anybody take a look and tell me what is missing? Basically `admin@test` creates an account in the same domain, this account grants to admin `can_set_my_account_detail` then `admin@test` set the account details .

What is the result you are trying to achieve? I see you created a batch that mixed commands from admin@test and t1@test. Then you created a transaction and signed with admin private key.  Then you tried to sign pending transaction with t1 private key. This is not how MST works. ~ Dr S Falken 😉

Hi Dr Falken!!! I'm looking for you for a whiiiiile! I think Joshua rules the earth now.... In the meantime, what I try to do with this buggy code: as atomic transactions are painful to rollback (impossible?) in case of an error in the middle, I try to combine all linked transactions (like in this case: create the sub account, grant the permissions, set the details and other things I removed in the example) so that if it fails, that's fine. But as you saw in this case, granting the permission has to be done by the secondary account. So I thought I needed to use the MST capability. IF this is not the case, how should I do? Simply sign each transaction in the batch with the good key before sending?

hello, i am exploring iroha to be used for our capstone project. i'm trying to use the java iroha sdk in android studio and i followed the instructions on how to import it using `compile "com.github.hyperledger.iroha-java:client:master-SNAPSHOT"`, but when i try to test it like im trying to call a class from the sdk, it doesn't work. did i miss something in importing the library? i need help on this please.. sorry because i'm also working on my android skills so i'm not familiar yet with how stuff works in android studio. thank you

Good evening, I am hoping that someone can answer my beginner question. If I were to try to make an Android application using Iroha, for example, a payment system, I could use the Java version of Iroha SDK for client, right? But for the back-end or server of my application, or whatever you call it.. what do I need to use for that?

Hello again, I have a problem with adding 2 signatories to an account (as done in https://github.com/iptelephony/jubilant-engine/blob/master/msig-example.py) . The account that requests to add signatories has a role with `can_add_signatory` permission, but when calling the `add_signatory` commands, it fails with error 2 (no permission). Details here: https://gist.github.com/shazz/dec827c1ce61c15ebe384b53c1bd6279. Any reason, do the 2 signatories accounts need some special permissions? Thanks !

I meant in general that smart contract functionality would allow DEX building. 

But well for bridges I agree that their design is difficult and chain specific, anyway having smart contacts would let you do bridge design similar to how it is down from Ethereum to other networks. Also later Iroha2 has plans to be able to act as parachain for Polkadot ecosystem, this would let Iroha2 based apps transfer assets across other parachains.

Ok! Until now, I’m pretty happy with Iroha1, quite stable (but not used yet in production), I really think it succeeded in his goal, really easy to use even to build relatively complex applications without the need of custom smart contracts thanks to built-in commands, queries and rich accounts (details, mst…). So iroha2 is designed to be again better, that’s tempting!

Are pending MST transactions safe with regards to double spending problem ?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 01 Jun 2021 06:27:47 GMT):<br/>
*[♌︎ Leo](https://t.me/iptelephony)* _via telegram_
It should be safe to my understanding, the transaction is not commited until sufficient signatures are collected. Suppose if I have 20.0 coins, and 2 MST, 1 to spend 14.0 coins and 1 to spend 7.0 coins. Depending on which completes first, the other will fail. The final balance would be either 6.0 or 13.0. This is based on my personal understanding and trials, so it may be wrong :).

It looks that you haven't stopped all irohad instances. Try to restart database first.

And about config, according to: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/main/configure/index.html#environment-specific-parameters: "mst_enable enables or disables multisignature transaction network transport in Iroha. Note that MST engine always works for any peer even when the flag is set to false. The flag only allows sharing information about MST transactions among the peers." so MST are always enabled
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 04 Jun 2021 14:27:40 GMT):<br/>

So in order to use MST I dont need to do anything different? My problem statement is that I want to addsignatory to accounts and sign pending transactions on desire. So do I need to set MST enabled or not?

You need to stop all nodes which are using database - so probably only one:)
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 04 Jun 2021 16:55:41 GMT):<br/>
*Yasir* _via telegram_
I haven't tested yet however would mst still work without enabling it? I want to add a signatory to double check transactions. So do I need to enable mst for all nodes or not?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 04 Jun 2021 18:11:27 GMT):<br/>
*[baziorek](https://t.me/baziorek)* _via telegram_
The flag `mst_enable` is just enabling sharing MST between nodes. When false MST are still working but not being shared between nodes
</p>

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 04 Jun 2021 21:15:22 GMT):<br/>

It depends if You want pending MST to be shared between nodes, or not. If You don't need the feature MST would work but be pending only on single node.

*[baziorek](https://t.me/baziorek)* _via telegram_
I haven't tested this on 8 nodes. But rather it is more comfortable to have the flag set to `true`.
You have asked earlier about something else - is it working now with the database?

</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 05 Jun 2021 12:23:56 GMT):<br/>

We are storing tx_hash as storing the whole tx for periodic status checking would be overkill I guess

Streaming is also fine. However I need to check status on requirement as we are going to use MST so need to have an API endpoint to check tx status so doing that with tx_hash would be better I think as otherwise we will have to store the whole tx object somewhere
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 05 Jun 2021 12:28:19 GMT):<br/>

or will have to process all blocks to get the tx back everytime which is waste of resources

Just to reiterate the point made by others, mst works on a peer regardless of the flag. The flag controls the sharing of mst transaction information among peers. So if you have need to check the status of mst transaction on other peers to then you need this flag. For my use cases I leave it on, because I assume all peers may need the mst transaction information.

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 05 Jun 2021 12:52:22 GMT):<br/>

if the initial transaction occurs on one one and the signing of the pending transactions on another one, does this flag needs to be enabled too?

I would do it both ways. Use an account to record detail of the object to be tracked, and create a coin type with the same name and mint just 1 token of that coin. Transfer that to the owner. Future transfers can use the transfer asset command. The good thing about this solution is you can choose to have x number of copies.

Actually I had done this manually in thr code. I changed the code of get_status function to accept tx hash instead of tx itself to check status but j have to put the whole package with the code for this

Guys I wanted to ask is there a way to make multiple queries at once. I am asking for this because I am making an iroha based web app and it displays a table with balances of individuals and since it displays like balances of 100+ people at a time it takes long to perform so many queries
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/iroha?msg=sQ3hKoMKWc5zvwFP6) what about some hybrid architecture? Make a separate croneJob that runs after every specific interval and get data from Iroha and save it in some centralized DB. Then you display in tables from DB....

So I have a webapp that has a table which displays balances of like 100 people. Now there is a button through which the admin can transfer money to the people in the table. Now on every click the table needs to be updated and hence the balances. And to get balances of 100 people i would need to run the get account assets query 100 times which takes quite a bit of time

If You want to have multiple nodes here is article how to do this:
https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/main/maintenance/add_peer.html
And the docker compose is using old iroha (from more than 3 years old), use 
`
hyperledger/iroha:1.2.1`

I see problems with connection between nodes, there were some corrections, so upgrading version should help You.

It looks like I know what is the problem!!
`
              {
                "addPeer": {
                  "peer": {
                    "address": "localhost:10001",
                    "peerKey": "d04da271b57fe63426ae1dc97f6952104037411fcf4f3b739dc217f45e5fc99b"
                  }
                }
              },`

it can't be `localhost` - You must provide address, because both servers are connecting to each other.
If You IPs can change I suggest to create aliases in `/etc/hosts`

Hi, reading all those messages on adding nodes, I tried on my side and I cannot get the 2 peers to connect
On both side I have this error:

node0 (iroha0)
[2021-06-12 02:04:05.660967080][I][Irohad/Consensus/Network]: Send votes bundle[size=1] to iroha1:50051

They are using the exact same genesis block where iroha0 is defined using its internal port:

`
"commands":[
    {
        "addPeer":{
            "peer":{
            "address":"iroha0:10001",
            "peerKey":"bddd58404d1315e0eb27902c5d7c8eb0602c16238f005773df406bc191308929"
            }
        }
    },`


in iroha0 config I have added:
`
json
  "initial_peers": [
    {
      "address": "iroha0:10001",
      "public_key": "bddd58404d1315e0eb27902c5d7c8eb0602c16238f005773df406bc191308929"
    },
    {
      "address": "iroha1:50051",
      "public_key": "135d989f636323b85a2b7da03f0835a304a858f89783adf31a6c88992cbf1546"
    }
  ]`


and on iroha1 config I have added:
`
json
  "initial_peers": [
    {
      "address": "iroha0:50051",
      "public_key": "bddd58404d1315e0eb27902c5d7c8eb0602c16238f005773df406bc191308929"
    },
    {
      "address": "iroha1:10001",
      "public_key": "135d989f636323b85a2b7da03f0835a304a858f89783adf31a6c88992cbf1546"
    }
  ]`


Both are on the same docker network and I check I can ping and netcat each one from the other using `netcat iroha1 50051` and `netcat iroha1 50051`

I think it would be useful for you check example of running 7 nodes on single machine:
https://codeberg.org/diva.exchange/iroha-explorer/src/branch/develop/docker-compose.yml
here You have example of genesis.blocks, keys, config.

The easiest solution to connect multiple nodes is to use iroha-cli, which would generate configuration for multiple nodes:
`
     echo 'node1_address:10001' > peers.list
     echo 'node2_address:10001' >> peers.list
     iroha-cli -genesis_block --peers_address peers.list`

and it will generate nodes.

You can also provide more information (config, genesis blocks), commands results.

Here You have tutorial how to connect multiple nodes:

`

Hi @Baziorek. The diva example doesn't help that much, they are using their own iroha image which looks different (other env variables, different entry point...)
But using the CLI to modifty the genesis block to add by default all the peers made me understand how it works.
So now I'm able to create node at first start and also to add ones after the fact.

Thanks!

Hello, I need a little off-topic but still relevant advice...
So what is the recommended method to save the private-keys for the users? We need to use the keys for the signatures on the transactions which go through APIs. So what is the right approach to secure the private keys? [We are using VPS nodes so no mobile app version of iroha]

Right now we are storing the keys into a database on our server however we think it is risky and hackable. So what should be the right way?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 12 Jun 2021 20:16:48 GMT):<br/>
*[baziorek](https://t.me/baziorek)* _via telegram_
I think that more securie solution would be to give keys for users - their fault if they get hacked. And use client libraries without sending keys. After the internship project would be finished: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/HL+Burrow+and+HL+Iroha+extend+existing+Solidity+VM+integration much more should be possible with smart contracts.
But I'm not security specialist

I think it should be possible to add another peer to single-peer network. I've tested its on version 1.2.0. It was necessarily to copy all blocks to another node (with the block containing add peer command).

That’s a very good question. Personally I store the keys outside any db, in a secure system. And each key is encrypted using a symmetric key derived from user password so even if the server is hacked, the keys cannot be decrypted. I don’t know if this is safe enough but at least better.

So when i run these 2 peers then from 2nd peer cli i call addPeer command and pass ip and public key of 2nd peer and send this txn on 1st peer ip.. 

When all this stuff happens then peer1 now has the data against this last hash but peer2 stops working and could not accpet any txn.. So Peer1 is working as a independent node and peer2 just stops with errors sometime failed to connect to all addressee

Is it typo in one of genesis block:
`
"address":"135.148.120.71:1001",`

shouldn't it be:
`
"address":"135.148.120.71:10001",`

because in the config.sample it is:
`
"internal_port" : 10001,`

The last node will answer queries but not commit transactions. It will also print lots of logs with connection error.

So my last guess is (I don't know docker-compose that good) that You should use `host` network instead of:
`
networks:
  wallet-js:
    name: wallet-js-${SUBNET}
    attachable: true`

and nodes would see each other. If I understood You properly You are running the docker-compose on two separate nodes, but they are in isolated networks.

As I am participating in mentorship program with @baziorek (https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Plan+of+Extend+HL+Iroha+queries+with+optional+arguments) I have a question about datetime format in queries protobuffs. We already have prove of concept which uses strings as format in which timestamp is passed. Is this format good enough or should it be changed? There is already `TimestampType` defined in types.hpp but I found no advantages of using it in this situation. Using it would require casting from int to string.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 18 Jun 2021 13:31:17 GMT):<br/>
*[kuvaldini](https://t.me/kuvaldini)* _via telegram_
1st of all i suggest to use time formatting as it is done in Git. There are a number of ways and formats of time.

2nd if you would like to use this datetime string directly from client to database it is definitely bad idea.

3. The best option is to use binary time format on the wire (i.e.) in protobuf.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 18 Jun 2021 13:32:30 GMT):<br/>
*[kuvaldini](https://t.me/kuvaldini)* _via telegram_
And convert binary datetime to/from string on demand. There are a lot of standartizef abilities/functions to do that in any prog lang

Thanks, we saw the answer. Kuvaldini was faster than preparing PR with changes:
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1092
to make the question more precise.
We will modify the format from `string` to some binary datetime format.
The PR is for now draft, after changing datetime format the PR would be updated.

The first node consumes a lot more memory than the 2nd and 3rd nodes and creates a lot of PIDs.
There is no activity on this node for a while on purpose, no transactions created, no queries. Nothing special in the logs.

Is it expected?

I'm not go specialist, I'm not sure if installing go dependencies as I've done above is professional, so it is better if somebody more experienced corrects the commands above.
Maybe it is better way to install from repository not directly with `wget`.

Hi,
I'm trying to use new feature from iroha-python library: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/main/develop/api/queries.html#result-pagination
So I'm keep trying without success. Does anybody knows how to change order of returned transactions?
I've tried:
`
            pagination_meta = queries_pb2.TxPaginationMeta()
            pagination_meta.ordering.sequence = [queries_pb2.kCreatedTime, queries_pb2.kAscending]

            query = iroha.query('GetAccountAssetTransactions', account_id=account_id, asset_id=asset_name, page_size=page_size, pagination_meta=pagination_meta)`

But for each try I'm seeing problem, e.g. for above:
`
AttributeError: Assignment not allowed to repeated field "sequence" in protocol message object.`

@liralemur  Is everything OK in the documentation here:
https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/main/configure/torii-tls.html#configuring-irohad
I mean the part:
`
key_pair_path - set this to full path to the key/certificate pair, such that if you have a key at /path/to/server.key and a certificate at /path/to/server.crt, you need to specify torii_tls_keypair=/path/to/server`

As I see in config:
`
"torii_tls_params": {
    "port": 55552,
    "key_pair_path": "/path/to/server"
}`

Shouldn't be `key_pair_path` instead of `torii_tls_keypair`?

@liralemur, @baziorek, I waived the latest community meeting. Interesting. Nevertheless, about storing keys, my understanding is the question is not how to store keys in iroha (which I agree should be secured) but in the clients (could be a mobile app, a website…) which interact with iroha and needs to provide the private key(s). Anyway, I’ll describe the solution I have implemented and ask for review.

I've tried to set up TLS between clients and peers and without success. I see the error like that:
`

So probably I would have to ask on the chat after solving my previous question.
*Or maybe somebody success with TLS connection between client and peer?*

Yes, I've followed instructions:
https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/main/configure/torii-tls.html
so I've generated keys:
`
openssl genpkey -algorithm rsa -out server.key
openssl req -new -key server.key -x509 -out server.crt`

Then I've added to config file:
`
"torii_tls_params": {
    "port": 55552,
    "key_pair_path": "/path/to/server"
}`

then I've changed iroha-python code:
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python/blob/4d10eb0fb64bb033c950a8b6a63c6fae25fe4373/iroha/iroha.py#L361
to:
`
        if secure:
            with open('/path/to/server.crt', 'rb') as f:
                trusted_certs = f.read()
            credentials = grpc.ssl_channel_credentials(root_certificates=trusted_certs)
            self._channel = grpc.secure_channel(self._address, credentials, **channel_kwargs)
        else:
            self._channel = grpc.insecure_channel(self._address, **channel_kwargs)`

and I see the problems with connections (of course the node is running).

I did not expect a blockchain migration so that’s fine. But in terms of API and domain objects, are you going to have something similar ? If I just need to change my iroha wrapper to create an account, add details (I use this capability a lot to certify information), transfer assets,… that would be good enough.

That’s good news ! I’m hurry to test the v2. And to see how Rust helped. The v1 is pretty good on a lot of points but the memory management looks… special. I found a leak last week (bug opened) but overall, consumption always goes up each time a transaction occurs and never goes down. But Makoto, thanks for spending so much time on this project, in my opinion, you don’t emphasis enough on how Iroha is soooo muchhhh simpler to use than any others private blockchains :)

About migration - if You mean transferring assets - currently I'm one of mentors of project:
Cactus and Iroha integration: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/HL+Iroha+and+HL+Cactus+Integration

Cactus is a framework to transfer assets and data between different networks (Fabric, Besu, etc). So when Cactus and Iroha 1 integration would work, the similar can be done as another internship project next year to add integration between Cactus and Iroha 2.

Hi @baziorek, yes and no. My migration question was more on how the API and concepts will differ, I don't plan to migrate the content of the blockchain. BUT, yes because I have a use-case where I need to "transfer" iroha assets to the ethereum blockchain. @Sara shared the cross-chain project soranet-eth but if Cactus can be used for such usecase between iroha1, iroha2 and ethereum... that would be perfect.

Hello,
Does anybody knows how to change order of returned transactions in iroha-python library?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 29 Jun 2021 21:16:11 GMT):<br/>
*Faizan Raza* _via telegram_
I tried to do the ordering through the iroha library but eventually gave up after trying a lot. Then I used the sorting ability of the pandas dataframe to change the order

Thanks for suggestions. I'm using its. But it would be useful feature to fetch last transaction for an account. Currently it is not easy when we have many transactions to fetch last, because 4Mb is limit of GRPC. It can be increased but it is taking long time to get response. Currently I'm using "pagination" - first hash of each week in year, but it would be more optimal to use the new feature.

I also have another question about the way to do health check for Iroha's docker container. 
Previously, I tried to use to "gRPC health probe" to implement(https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-health-probe). It did not work for Iroha. Now, I switched to netcat/netstat to check if 50051 tcp port is open.
`netcat -zv 127.0.0.1 50051 || exit 1` 
Please see screenshot below.

However, I feel it is not an ideal solution because sometimes the tcp port is open does not necessarily mean the service is working completely.

I also thought about utilizing iroha-cli, but it seems to me that I should probably query the admin@test account using a json format file. 
I am unsure:
a. whether the cli -json functionality is working? (https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/iroha/issues/2054)
b. is there any format template for the json query file?

You could use a little python client using an account with limited permissions. Easy to do but a little heavy.

If you need a healthcheck tool you may use metrics. And as a numric parameter of health  periodically ask irohad for its metrics. They contain total number of blocks and transactions, number of peers, etc.

It also could be a good idea to monitor health of iroha network with checking if number of blocks is the same on different nodes. (Note: some delays between nodes are possible)

I think it is possible only with: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/main/develop/api/queries.html#get-block called multiple times. The another solution is to add to transaction description number of last blockchain block (retrived with getBlock). I think adding block number to transaction is hidden by design (encapsulated information).

yes but to call GetBlocks you need to know the current height. So what I did at the end is using the WSV, I'd like to avoid it but the API lacks some features.

So as I understood documentation correctly calling:
`
shepherd --irohad 127.0.0.1:11001 --status --verbosity debug`

should print something? Of course I have in my config file:
`
...
  "utility_service": {
        "ip": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 11001
  }
...`

I started irohad, then when it was reading 20k blocks I've used the `shepherd` command and no output. Did I do something wrong, or it is bug in the tool?

That tool was written years ago. I never used or worked on it.
I believe it must return at least status code. But should (as i feel) write something to stdout.

I will not help you with that code. But you'd better write your own wrappers around public protobuf. If you cannot reach iroha-java maintenainer write your own. It is very thin client on top of protobuf.

ok in your own docker compose where you have iroha and postgres, only add something like `
    explorer:
        image: divax/iroha-explorer:latest
        container_name: explorer
        restart: always
        depends_on:

            - IP_EXPLORER=0.0.0.0
            - PORT_EXPLORER=3920

I thought it was the value of YAC, despite the less than 1/3 required nodes, to be fast and scalable :)

The YAC paper is OK. The implementation of Iroha 1 and 2 is not living up to those specs. That's more or less what the in-depth tests prove. diva has left Iroha behind, but it just means that Iroha is not suitable for diva. Iroha might be great for others (like on a controlled LAN network).

The complete test suites (for any current or future version of iroha), see repo on codeberg.org, are in Python - so the core of all must not be translated 😁. The full work itself won't be translated by diva - except it would be sponsored by some organization or alike.

1. U’d better use ‘main’ branch or ever tag 1.2.1 - it is the most stable
2. if just need to run - use `docker run` as I said earlier
3. to run iroha you need config, psql database, genesis.block, and node-keypair. Everything is well-documented and files are inside examples/ directory

Tomorrow tests would be only from python. But in future - it would be question for Iroha Team what tests do You want. Are tests in Python OK since Iroha C++ code is not being changed for now, just golang code. Or You want tests in iroha main repo (e.g. iroha/test/integration/acceptance/engine_call_test.cpp).

Hi, I downloaded the lastest copy of Iroha Javascript library, but I was unable to use the revokePermission/grantPermission command. I already made admin@test with root priviledge, so I believe he can grant/revoke permissions for arbitrary user.

But running either grantPermission or revokePermission will lead to error message like this. Did I made some mistake in passing parameters to "command"?

You cannot grant/revoke arbitrary permissions.  Only the permissions marked with ‘grantable’ can be granted or revoke. See this page https://iroha-test.readthedocs.io/en/build-fix/develop/api/permissions/

Seriously, read the docs. grant/revoke grants the permission of the transaction creator to the target account. Your code fragment means to grant CAN_SET_MY_ACCOUNT_DETAIL of admin to user3, if that’s what you have in mind. I suggest u try to replicate those test cases in example/python/permissions with your language of choice. Those are all working test cases, so you can cross reference the expected behavior.

I was able to resolve the issue. For anyone who encountered similar issue, the reason is that you need to import RolePermission and use that to deal with the command string.

From my experience - if You want to have more than 1 peer in a network: don't use "127.0.0.1" (localhost) address in genesis block. Use aliases if necessarily.
And to removePeer You need to have two peers connected, probably they need to talk to each other (2/3 peers needs to agree with the command to commit), so You can't remove peer if You have only 2 of them and one of them is off (I assume it is from peer Key).

Hi, I see, it seems I got your use case wrong. I assumed you wanted to manipulate a user's key set.

I guess the behaviour you get might be expected since 2 peers cannot form a majority required for the operation. The peer which is being removed is not considered as a valid participant of consensus within the flow so the transaction cannot be committed. But I'm not sure if that is the edge case for the consensus. Maybe others could comment on my consideration.

Thank you. My thinking is that is it because it was not a valid peer. However, I somehow followed the example from the official repo:
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/main/example/python/permissions/can_remove_peer.py 
It seems to me that they added an arbitrary and invalid peer and removed that peer.

In that case for sure. Actually the network stops working after comitting the first transaction 'AddPeer'. From that no transaction could gather enough votes.

For correct case you have to deploy another container peer with identical genesis and config and set its address in the script above

That makes sense! I was trying to do that yesterday. The problem I encountered was I had some trouble granting the getPeer() and removePeer() priviledge to the admin via the genesis block.

are you sure the peers use the update genesis? you could dive into the container like that as an example
docker exec <iroha-peer-container-id> -it bash
cd /tmp/block_store
cat 000000000001

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Wed, 21 Jul 2021 13:15:24 GMT):<br/>

I made sure node1's "genesis.block" == node1's "000000000001" == node2's "genesis.block" == node2's "000000000001".
But seems that the permission is still not there. Do you feel if there is any other things that I might miss?

Hi, for Iroha's Javascript SDK, is there a way to pass in a GRPC deadline parameter to our command call? I checked CommandService_v1Client class, basically, there was a third option (object type) to be passed it. So, in this case I want to pass in a deadline so that the GRPC stream will automatically be canceled in 5 seconds.

About the timeout, you can try to send a string instead of the int, this might work : { deadline: '5000' }

But generally JS maintainer suggested to use timeoutLimit attribute instead


Hope this helps

Thank you! 
1. Passing in { deadline: '5000' } compiles successfully, but it did not actually help cancel the grpc connection. 
2. I always pass in a time out limit of 5000, but the command request does not stop automatically.

Hi, I want to make a modified Iroha docker image by modifying this Dockerfile. (https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/main/docker/release/Dockerfile)
I saw that it takes advantage of generated iroha.deb and iroha_shepherd.deb files. But I was wondering how to get them?

Here's the plan:
1. Demonstration of how to migrate your blockchain from your old database to the new, more efficient one;
2. See the new tool that will help you to check the success of the migration process;
3. Internship presentation on Hyperledger Cactus and Iroha integration project

Upon inspection, I believe that it is too large because I installed the iroha.deb and iroha_shepherd.deb files. But should I switch to simply copy+paste irohad and iroha-cli instead to shrink the size of the image?

@kuvaldini Hi Ivan,
I used the standard Iroha Dockerfile (https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/1.2.1/docker/release/Dockerfile) to generate the docker image. However, I feel that the step of installing iroha.deb and shephard.deb costs 564MB. Is there a way that I could achived the standard <200MB docker image size? (Should I do like copy+paste generated irohad + iroha-cli binaries? )

You really do not need iroha-cli and shephed to make Iroha daemon work. You do not need *.deb.

Just copy irohad to fresh ubuntu. And it will work. With rocks.db you even do not need to set up postgres. 
Rocksdb needs just one folder - it should be docker volume - to keep data between different runs of image.

Hello everyone!
I was wondering how it is possible to define attributes per asset in Iroha, as in this example where the asset is a car and the attributes are its color, its size…: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/main/develop/cases.html#id1
I read the API reference and I don’t see anything close to this.
Thank you in advance!

Hello Antoine.
Iroha does not provide ability to describe assets with attributes,  asset can have name and precision. Precision is expected to be numeric value.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 30 Jul 2021 17:03:14 GMT):<br/>

How could you use account details to store an asset related property ? What if the account holds multiple assets of the same kind ?

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 30 Jul 2021 18:06:49 GMT):<br/>
*[kuvaldini](https://t.me/kuvaldini)* _via telegram_
There is a way to create account with same name as asset in same domain. And when you need to store or read asset attributes refer to that account details.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 30 Jul 2021 18:28:10 GMT):<br/>
*[kuvaldini](https://t.me/kuvaldini)* _via telegram_
Are the attributes asset-wide? I believe there could not be different units of same asset with different attributes.

Okay I see. I am in a real estate context, the unit asset is a lot, hence  its property keys could differ in the asset. I see that a transaction has a description attribute. Serializing the lot attributes in the transaction could be a better fit, couldn’t it?

Hello.
I am using Iroha Javascript (iroha-helpers) to build my application.
Can we actually get the transaction hashes after doing some transaction commands like "transferAsset" or any other transaction like "addAssetQuantity"?
Because the success result (if there is no error) given by the promise is always null.

Thank you!

You can edit the iroha-helpers library to return the txHash.
I have actually done this for one of my projects:
-this is the edited library: https://www.npmjs.com/package/iroha-helpers-ts
-this is the project which it is used: https://github.com/dominic-pa/iroha-rest-server

You'd get something like this:

{
    "status": "COMMITTED",
    "txHash": "eb539b7d43e18b92f935a3e20b3eec1f343d939ebce776bfaea8c4ea48b8c1ec"

Here's an instruction from a JS dev (similar to what Dominic said really):
1) Create a TxBuilder object like here: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-javascript/blob/master/example/chain.ts 
const txBuilder = new TxBuilder()
  .createAccount({
    accountName: 'user2',
    domainId: 'test',
    publicKey: '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
  })
2) Sign and send it
3) Getting the transaction out of the builder and getting it through the hash function from here:  
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-javascript/blob/master/src/txHelper.ts

const txHash = hash(txBuilder.tx)

Is this mean I couldn't transfer from another domain when I signed as admin@test ?  could be  flexible if I grant permission to alii@bank1

If I want to log in or sign in as `
alii@bank1`
,  how to retrieve public and private keys for `
alii@bank1`
 to get login like: 
`
ADMIN_ACCOUNT_ID = os.getenv('ADMIN_ACCOUNT_ID', 'admin@test')
ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY = os.getenv(
    'ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY', 'f101537e319568c765b2cc89698325604991dca57b9716b58016b253506cab70')`

In your code here are keys:
`
user_private_key = IrohaCrypto.private_key()
user_public_key = IrohaCrypto.derive_public_key(user_private_key)`

after calling first of functions a new private key is returned, so You have to save the key somewhere

Hello. 

I just tried this method. The hash is generated successfully but it's on buffer format. 
When I convert it to hex string then use it to get a transaction, the results says that the hashes is incorrect or in CLI says that transaction was not found in the system.
(Tried both via the JavaScript library and via Iroha CLI)
Is there anything that i missed?

Thank you very much.

@KheyroDZ ok, so, there are 2 keys to success with building with Burrow - have Go installed and using the -DUSE_BURROW=ON  flag (https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/main/build/index.html#id8 - here you need to configure the build with cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -G "Ninja" .. -DUSE_BURROW=ON). 

One of the maintainers suggested to use Docker (you are using it already as we can see) but here's a trick that might help: docker run -it hyperledger/iroha-builder:support-1.2.x this should already rid you of the Go step.

I guess I forgot a line in the gist. If I remember well (I’ll check asap), this is using the docker/release directory from the iroha source (so git clone has to be done before or docker cp from the builder container to get the release folder which has the dockerfile)

Oh no problems, thanks a lot for your support. I think that I found a solution. 
I used :
`sudo docker inspect builder`
to inspect the mounts and check the relation between the container folders and the host.
And I found an absolute path in the host containing the `docker/release/` folder. I used it in the `docker build`command.
The build process has been successfully finished. I'll try using Iroha with burrow to validate the installation.

what you can do: `cp *iroha_shepherd.deb ../docker/release/iroha_shepherd.deb
cp *irohad.deb ../docker/release/iroha.deb
cd ..
tar -cvf docker.tar docker

# from host
sudo docker cp b045aa1291fe:/opt/iroha/iroha/docker.tar .

Integration in last release is limited to (according to https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/main/integrations/burrow_example.html) into: `GetAccountAsset` and `TransferAsset` (without possibility of changing description).
Two more commands has been added: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1152 there are:
`createAccount`,  `addAssetQuantity`
in August rest of commands and queries would be added, probably without `FetchCommits`, so hopefully full integration would be in next release:).

Hello Iroha team,  as described in docs, we could create an account with a unique name or number, but the financial institutions require it should be compatible with ISO 13616-1:2020, called International bank account number( IBAN). Is the created account  by Iroha have a unique identifier compatible with this ISO

Guess it depends on your use case. If privacy is not your concern, by all means. For one of our applications, we used a hash of PII as account id. So authorized users can lookup the account if they know the PII, but we don't have to store it in clear in the Blockchain.

Our meeting is in 70 minutes!  

Today we will, as usual, share some updates (hopefully - including some exciting data we gathered during testing) and also tell about newly implemented blockstore in RocksDB and a new migration tool.
And, of course, we will have time for some questions and discussion.

Hey guys, I am reposting my question

<p><strong>rafik_naccache</strong> (Fri, 13 Aug 2021 13:30:52 GMT):<br/>
si my Iroha server works jsut fine, and every 24 ours or so, it goes idle, that is, it hangs up. When restarted, it resumes normal operations
</p>
<p><strong>rafik_naccache</strong> (Fri, 13 Aug 2021 13:31:56 GMT):<br/>
it actually is not crashing or anything, so my question is this: is it related to the max_rounds_delay param ?
</p>
<p><strong>rafik_naccache</strong> (Fri, 13 Aug 2021 13:32:10 GMT):<br/>
does it go idle if it does not receive any transaction for too long ?
</p>
<p><strong>rafik_naccache</strong> (Fri, 13 Aug 2021 13:32:19 GMT):<br/>
or could it be related to the WSV N

Hi, does anyone know who may be the reason that the docker services of iroha stops and all the transactions are rolled back (i think) because, when i start again the services there are not all the accounts, and anything that was done previously

Hi,
I have question about adding peers to existing network.
__________
I've 3-noded network, all 3 nodes are in `genesis.block` and I want to add another one node.
So I've followed steps: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/main/maintenance/add_peer.html, to be more precise:
1. Nodes are seeing each others (ping works)
2. Command `add_peer` was accepted and is part of block:
`
{
  "blockV1": {
    "payload": {
      "transactions": [
        {
          "payload": {
            "reducedPayload": {
              "commands": [
                {
                  "addPeer": {
                    "peer": {
                      "address": "node4:10001",
                      "peerKey": "00...00"
                    }
                  }
                }
              ],
              "creatorAccountId": "admin@test",
              "createdTime": "1628894312489",
              "quorum": 1
            }
          },
          "signatures": [
            {
              "publicKey": "...",
              "signature": "..."
            }
          ]
        }
      ],`

3. The new node is running with the same genesis block and similar config, but the logs are strange:
`
[2021-08-13 22:53:03.925585490][I][Irohad/Consensus/Network]: RPC succeeded: ipv4:node1:10001

[2021-08-13 22:53:04.924788989][I][Irohad/Consensus/Network]: RPC succeeded: ipv4:node2:10001`

and nothing more than first block file `0000000000000001` is in the proper directory. What is more network with old 3 nodes is fortunately still working. Do You have any idea what can be wrong?

About versions: 3 nodes are currently using `1.2.1`, but new one is `hyperledger/iroha-burrow:support-1.2.x` - but it shouldn't be problem, should it?

few months ago it was also not working, so I was copying all blocks then rerunning new node and everything was fine. This time I decided that I can't use dirty hacks  many times.

<p><strong>rafik_naccache</strong> (Sat, 14 Aug 2021 07:38:14 GMT):<br/>
I am runjing Iroha, mounting the blockstore in /opt
</p>
<p><strong>rafik_naccache</strong> (Sat, 14 Aug 2021 07:39:12 GMT):<br/>
I Avoided tmp because I thought it is cleaned up automatically by the OS, which would lead to my data being reset each time we start the service
</p>
<p><strong>rafik_naccache</strong> (Sat, 14 Aug 2021 07:40:20 GMT):<br/>
Nothing in the doc saying using tmp is mandatory, nor it os saying tmp is preferred... not in the other way too: there is no clear ref in the doc saying to pay atrention to the tmp, that this is only for testing purposes etc...
</p>
<p><strong>rafik_naccache</strong> (Sat, 14 Aug 2021 07:40:59 GMT):<br/>
Service starts and works fine for me but for time to time (each 24 hours or so) it stopa being responsiv3
</p>
<p><strong>rafik_naccache</strong> (Sat, 14 Aug 2021 07:41:09 GMT):<br/>
Restarting the service brong hom back
</p>
<p><strong>rafik_naccache</strong> (Sat, 14 Aug 2021 07:42:10 GMT):<br/>
So I dont know... could this phenomenon be related to me using another thing than tmp - though I dont see why?
</p>
<p><strong>rafik_naccache</strong> (Sat, 14 Aug 2021 07:42:22 GMT):<br/>
And how could the storage be persistent if put on tmp?
</p>
<p><strong>rafik_naccache</strong> (Sat, 14 Aug 2021 07:42:45 GMT):<br/>
Sorry to ask but I really canr find any reference to that on the doc
</p>

And we're uskng iroha in a major marketplace  - we went live tomorrow - so please help us make it work , and this will be a good success story to brah about :)

Hello. I already manage to get the correct transaction hash of "non-batch" transaction. But now when I try the same method to each transaction that goes to batch builder (to become a batch transaction), the generated transaction hash is incorrect (when I try to query the transaction by hash it says that the hash is incorrect). Do you know how to get the correct hash of batch transaction?
Thank you very much!

Hi, please share the code sample. Make sure you acquire the hash after appending the transaction to a batch (that influences the hash).

===If the the transaction is not a batch transaction the hash is correct===

I guess you set a batch meta wrong. Not sure how is the sdk you're using implemented. Probably 'batch.send' recalculates the batch meta (check the library code if you can), it should be an ordered array of the hashes of the reduced payload of the transactions. Since it affects a transaction hash you get an irrelevant one.

Hi! This give me clue. 

When I sign each transaction outside of batch builder they returns "STATELESS_VALIDATION_FAILED".
Then I dive in to txHelper and found a function that I can use to get the transaction inside batch (createTxListFromArray).
Then I map all of the transaction so that I can get the hash of each transaction.
And now each of the returned hash is correct. 

Thank you very much!

===Code===
const batch = new BatchBuilder([
        setIdcTx,
        setFullNameTx
    ])
        .setBatchMeta(1)
        .sign([PRIVATE_KEY], 0)
        .sign([PRIVATE_KEY], 1)

    return await batch.send(commandService)
        .then(() => {

            const txList = createTxListFromArray(batch.txs).getTransactionsList()
            const txHash = txList.map((item, index) => {
                return hashTx(item)
            })

            const hashesList = [
                hashCreateAcc,
                ...txHash
            ]

            return res.status(200).json({
                message: "",
                info: hashesList
            })

The order does not really matter. Python example:
You can get the information as a json string and then:
#1 parse it:
parsedInformation = json.loads('{"Name":"Ali", "Sure_name": "Hamed", "Year_of_birth":"1986"}')

# 2 use it as a dictionary:
print(parsedInformation["Name"])

This would print Hamed. Works similar in other languages.

Python actually keeps the order. I am not deep enough into Iroha to know how exactly they handle putting the data into the table.

Here are some more python tests:

import json

# some JSON:
x = '{"admin":{ "name":"John", "age":30, "city":"New York"}}'

# parse x:
y = json.loads(x)
z = json.loads(x)["admin"]

z['test']='value'

# the result is a Python dictionary:
print("Test: " + z["test"])
print("Option 1: " + str(y["admin"]["age"]))
print("Option 2: " + z["name"])
print("Keys: " + str(z.keys()))

Be very careful of what key/value you pass into the API, the KV are stored as JSON. If your KV content breaks the JSON, it fails

If it is ``
STATELESS_VALIDATION_FAILED`
` so one of options is possible:
1. `acnt + "@" + dmn` is not valid account
2. `key_[0]` is not valid name (it must follow rules for account name without domain)
3. `vale_[0]` is breaking json

So if the 3 commands at once don't work, but they work separately it can be problem that it is more than GRPC limit (as I remember 4Mb). If not it looks like full code would be helpful.

To the function `def set_info_to_account(acnt, dmn, key_, vale_):` You provide as key: 
`
    key_list = ["Name", "Surname", "Year_of_birth", "PhoneNo"]
    set_info_to_account(acnt, dmn, str(key_list), str(values_list))`

so it is:
`
str(key_list)
"['Name', 'Surname', 'Year_of_birth', 'PhoneNo']"`

so in the function You are creating command (look to the key):
`
iroha.command('SetAccountDetail', account_id=acnt + "@" + dmn, key='[', value=''),`

Hi,
I have a question. I looked up Iroha's doc regarding pub/priv keys.
(https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/main/develop/keys.html?highlight=ed25519#public-keys)
I believe Iroha favors keys using ed25519/sha3 algorithm, but may I know if PEM format keys are acceptable?

Hi! I have a question. When we do batch transactions in python, we do batch meta by iroha.batch([tx1,tx2],atomic=True)

This iroha instance is based on only 1 user however documentation says that batches can have transactions from different users. So how would this work in that case?

If You want to have really good example, which helped many people with understanding batch transactions, her is code:

It doesn't have a batch transaction example

Ok, so I gathered some expert knowledge and will try to convey it further ) so, here's an example like what you want to do: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python/blob/main/examples/batch-example.py#L153 
There Bob signs his transaction later, but it is not an issue if called ic.sign_transaction for Bob's transaction with his private key.

That's one thing. 
Another is the general way batches are made:
1) txs - transactions - can be made by different users, that's definitely not an issue
2) you create unsigned transactions by different users
3) add them batchmeta (basically making them a batch)
4) sign them with the respective signatures of the creator users - transaction by Alice with Alice's key, Bob's transaction with Bob's key etc
5) send the signed transactions together to listTorii 

That's the general concept

Its being rejected if I do them in a batch but working fine as two separate transactions

Please check if it makes sense. Basically I am trying to have NFT facility within iroha so creating account and asset and then setting details of that account to store NFT based specifics. tx1 does go fine but tx2 gets rejected.

Hi, as I am one of the half-time mentees, and most of my PRs are accepted (https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1300 and others) and the rest of my intern will still last for two months, I would like to ask if I can participate in developing Iroha for this time? It would be ideally if I could develop iroha1.2.x or try some things connected with iroha2.  I consulted it with my mentor @baziorek , he approves. I hope for some interesting propositions.
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Wed, 25 Aug 2021 22:26:47 GMT):<br/>
*[baziorek](https://t.me/baziorek)* _via telegram_
True, he has two Approves for PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/pull/1300 from two members from Iroha Core Team, so should he correct something more in the PR, or it can be merged?
His work, according to the project description: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Extend+HL+Iroha+queries+with+optional+arguments is to extend:
After merging the PR it looks like his work for Iroha 1 Core would be finished  (his work was to extend `GetAccountTransactions`, `GetAccountAssetTransactions` and `GetPendingTransactions` for Postgres and RocksDB. The remaining parts would be to merge PR to Iroha client libraries: python, java, nodeJS, iOS

1. `GetAccountTransactions
2.GetAccountAssetTransactions`  
`3.GetPendingTransactions

`1 and 2 was already merged for Postgres, and it looks like Iroha Core Team used the code for RocksDB, so it done. The last missing part for Iroha Core Code is the PR #1300, which is already approved. So after merging the only missing parts would be to merge PRs for Iroha client libraries: python, java, nodeJS, iOS (PRs for python, nodeJS and ready to merge).

After that he would finish entire internship project, so the question for Iroha 2 team - should be something connected with the internship project (filtering transactions by time range) added to Iroha 2?

Hello Gregorz and Piotr!

It's great that you are ready to work on something else! It's night in Europe now but in the morning I'll ping Iroha 2 team members here (if they won't check the chat before that) and I'm sure we will find something interesting for you to tackle!

About merge - I'd wait for Ivan's approval (I don't feel comfortable tagging him at night too, but I will in the morning) as he's I think the ruler of merges these days as we've been having some CI issues.

Hello, I finally manage not only to compile but to run cli and irohad, I will share a readme later, facing the fact that there is many changes that are not documented such as database creation externally, among others.

Finally following certain gitter conversations I found the broken links to migration tools, and continuing to browse I found iroha-state-migration-tool repository and manage to create the desire database.

Now, after that, this error keeps appearing :

irohad: ../irohad/ametsuchi/impl/mutable_storage_impl.cpp:152: virtual iroha::expected::Result<iroha::ametsuchi::MutableStorage::CommitResult, std::__cxx11::basic_string<char> > iroha::ametsuchi::MutableStorageImpl::commit(iroha::ametsuchi::BlockStorage&) &&: Assertion `ledger_state_' failed.

I copy the example genesis.block and it worked, I also replace with the testing information I needed and worked too. 
Is still uncertain what caused the core dump with the previous genesis file as I generate that using the iroha-cli.
For now I will leave it alone and work on the "business" part of my implementation. 
Thank you @Kuvaldini for your support.

To fully implement the functionality it would be good to review changes in client libraries:
1. Iroha-js library: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-javascript/pull/63 - it is already reviewed and approved by me
2. Iroha-python library: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python/pull/77 - it is already reviewed by me

could somebody take a look please?

Hello, everyone. I am a college student creating a Digital wallet using Hyperledger iroha. I was curious if anyone knew of a sample code on github where I could start off with. Btw, I will use android for this project
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 15:24:06 GMT):<br/>
*[Grouvie](https://t.me/Grouvie)* _via telegram_
Do you already have the backend running?
I would suggest using the docker container to do so:
https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/support-1.2.x/getting_started/index.html
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Wed, 01 Sep 2021 16:45:20 GMT):<br/>
*[baziorek](https://t.me/baziorek)* _via telegram_
Useful for You would be:
1. Sample wallet1: https://github.com/soramitsu/iroha-wallet-js
2. Sample wallet2: https://github.com/claudiocandio/borsello

And to use Iroha from Android You have two client libraries:
- https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-java
- https://github.com/hyperledger-archives/iroha-android - it is archived project, not supported anymore

Some time ago I remember question about iroha-android library and somebody suggested to use iroha-java library, the answer from Sara (You can find conversation in Telegram):
> Hi! Android library is not supported anymore - but Iroha-java works great for Android apps! Please use it.

Hi! That's exactly the reason - the libraries that are not in use anymore and that are not maintained or developed get archived - instead of a special Android lib now there's a Java library that can be used for creating Android apps and clients using Java.

✅ New Iroha Release Candidate! Please, welcome Iroha 1.3 ☺️

https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/releases/tag/1.3.0-rc.1 

This release candidate contains many new features and some of them can greatly improve your systems' performance, so you can check it now. 

*Please note that it is a release candidate and not a full release yet - the only difference is that we are still running some tests before officially announcing it. 

*There is another change too - now *main* is the branch containing the latest release (not much changed there) and *develop* is the branch with the most recent changes - a development branch that replaced support/1.2.x

_Test the new release and let us know what you think!

Thanks a lot for suggestions.

So when I call:
`
docker pull hyperledger/iroha-burrow:main`

it is iroha 1.3 with burrow support, or not yet?

And another question - ``docker pull hyperledger/iroha`:develop` is with https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/tree/develop automatically after each commit, or You are doing its manually regularly?

Hi Everyone!
I want to benchmark our ethereum private network and would like to use the caliper for this. I have the configuration file for it but it's giving me error "You must provide the json interface of the contract when instantiating a contract object" I have pasted my network configuration file code and command. Can you please help me out in solving this.

@liralemur Here is my question from chat:
To finish "mandatory part" of the internship: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Extend+HL+Iroha+queries+with+optional+arguments only 3 PRs are required to merge. They are completed by Piotr (the intern), and reviewed by me, so maybe they can be reviewed and merged: 
1. https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-java/pull/83/ - approved by Mingela, so maybe it can be merged?
2. https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python/pull/77 - corrected according to suggestions from kuvaldini and iceseer 
3. https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-javascript/pull/63 - not reviewed yet by Iroha Core Team

Fake bitcoin transaction software 👨‍💻 👨‍💻  available!!! 


WHAT EXACTLY IS A FAKE BTC
TRANSACTION SOFTWARE??


The fake Bitcoin transaction software is a software programed to make fake BTC transactions,
It enables you send fake BTC to ur registered wallet and then send it to any wallet of your choice.


HOW DO THE SOFTWARE WORK??

The software is very easy to use after registering your wallet to it.
After your wallet registration, all you need to do anytime u want to send fake BTC to any wallet, all u have to do  is Input the wallet address and the amount of BTC u would want to send, and then click on send.

HOW LONG DO THE FAKE BITCOIN LAST IN A WALLET??

The bitcoin can last for 90 days. That's the maximum.


IF I SEND THE BTC TO MY WALLET WILL I BE ABLE TO SELL IT??

Yes you can send it to a maximum of five wallet. When u send it to five wallet it won't be able to move again from the fifth wallet.

Thanks for merging two of them.
The only one left, so if You have time please take a look into last one:
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-javascript/pull/63 - approved by @stefashkaa already

BTW. @iceseer I've found a possibility to help You with, so I've created PR:
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python/pull/83
The problem is that in iroha-python PRs was being merged into `main`, not `develop`, so `develop` got outdated. Few days ago something was merged to `develop`. So I've updated `develop` with changes from `main`. Hopefully it will help.

Great!
Thanks a lot! So the internship is officially completed:D.

So now is time to make those changes public officially - releases of new version of libraries.
1. https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-javascript - last release 27 Apr 2018
2. https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python - last release 21 May, but without important changes (not only the internship project, but also two bugs reported by me + my Two changes:D)

I'll ask about its during next community bi-weekly meeting

It looks that Iroha is working fine. Reject value is incrementing, because You are not doing anything (not sending any commands), aren't You?

Yes.. After running the docker image 
I am typing this to start iroha
irohad --config config.docker --genesis_block genesis.block --keypair_name node0

So it is just running iroha node. And because no transactions are coming You see reject value incrementing. Send a command and You will see different log for a moment. Then when no commands the same log as before.
Way of logging can be changed in config:
https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/develop/configure/index.html#logging
e.g. to disable logging if nothing is happening

@eadventurous is right - there is no Flutter SDK but it might be possible to build one as Iroha uses protobuff

Hello, is it there a straighforward way to deploy iroha on kubernete on local machine with minikube and have the simple tests running successfully like in the quick start guide here : https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/develop/getting_started/cli-guide.html#creating-the-first-transaction ?
Till now when trying validation of any transaction, it stucks at the step of [enough_signatures_collected] with this message in cli when checking the status : "Transaction has collected all signatures. "

Hi!

I checked it out — those news are collected from the HL blogs about Iroha, it seems. We mostly focused on development though — there is a new version in development, the existing one got some nice updates. It is not something for the blog but it is good for using Iroha. You can try out the new version of Iroha 1 with RocksDB — it got way faster. Or check out the code of Iroha 2 :)

@Ali_Hamed The option can be useful when You are using MST (multi-signature transactions). And can be enabled with https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/develop/configure/index.html#environment-specific-parameters `mst_enable`. Without the option You would be able to sign pending transactions only on the same Noode where the transactions are waiting. But with the option You can sign on any server. That is how I understand its.

Thanks @liralemur for the link.

@liralemur BTW. Are there any plans to auto-remove old pending transactions? Currently in config we have `mst_expiration_time`, but pending transactions are waiting "forever". I think it would be good to auto-clean them after exceeding `mst_expiration_time`.
I remember presentation made by Vadim Reutskiy about 1.2.0 - he told about problem with pending transactions that they are in RAM so many pendings can kill node, or with option  ``mst_enable`` kill entire network.

*Sandy Kristiawan* _via telegram_
Hello. 

I am currently trying out the Hyperledger Iroha 1.2.1.
I want to know how Hyperledger Iroha manage to keep the blockchain data consistent. 

I attempted to make changes to one of the peer's blockstore data (by trying to remove 1 or more block in the blockstore directory). But then even after some "commands" transaction, the "lost" block didn't restored in the changed peer's blockstore directory.

Thank you.

Is it true that the synchronization only happens when starting the peer?
I managed to restore the peer's missing block. But it's only happens if these condition are met:
- The block must be in order
- If the block is missing when the peer is still running, the missing block is not restored (not synced). Instead a new block still will be added
- The synchronization only happens when the peer is starting

- The synchronization FROM DISK only happens when the peer is starting YES
- The synchronization FROM NETWORK is continual
- File-based block storage is not protected from corruption in any way. Block strorage does not participate not in consensus, nor in applying new blocks. It is only needed to respond to queries. 
- Actual state (WSV) is in database

I just tried experimenting.
Is it true if data from one of peer's WSV (like user account detail) changed, even if all peer is restarted the data is not synchronized with other peer? I tried restarting the peer but the changed data still exists in just one peer's database.

It will remain corrupted until WSV rebuild. Queries to this node will return wrong data, but transaction based on this data will be rejected. We have some tasks to check it consistency with block store for the future releases.

Hello community! I'm experimenting with Iroha and Iroha-helpers (a js library to communicate with the network). I'm having issues to process a "TransferAssets" transaction, it gives me a 'STATEFUL_VALIDATION_FAILED' error message, but nothing else about why it's failing. This happens when I tried to make an asset transfer between 'userA@test' and 'userB@test' . I do not get the same issues IF I perform this transaction with the sender being 'admin@test'. All accounts have a balance of the asset that I'm trying to transfer, and they all have the same role 'user' which has the 'can_transfer' 'can_recieve' roles. This issue only happens when 'admin@test' is not the sender. otherwise it works just fine. Does anyone have an idea on how can I solve this error ?

Hi There, I have a question about MST on Iroha. I'm currently developing app using iroha and iroha-helpers for JS, if I want to create a multi signature transactions, what command should I use?
</p>

Hi,
I'm using iroha-python and I've never used JavaScript, but I think it would be helpful:
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-python/blob/41a724b3f3f21921ad455d39fb959f45c98fe986/examples/batch-example.py#L116
in transaction we change `quorum` into more than 1.

Just as @baziorek mention, there's no specific command to use MST. Just need to change the quorum for the transaction

Has someone been able to use this repo (https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-deploy) successfully on local minikube kubernetes or another kubernetes network ?
Can someone tell me why i'm having "[Irohad/AsyncNetworkClient]: RPC failed: Deadline Exceeded" from pod logs and how to resolve it ?

Hi,
I have some kind of  cryptographical question about another question connected with generation of private - key.
Lets assume I want to generate private key for a device which has unique ID, e.g. RPI firmware ID: `0000000012345678` and I want to have possibility of checking if the private key was generated for the unique ID.
I know I can generate (pseudocode):
`
sha256(0000000012345678)`

and check if they are the same. But it would be not secure, because the unique ID can be known to others.
So do You know any way how to check if a private key was generated with the ID, but without possibility of retriving the private key with just firmware ID?
Is any better way than adding salt to the ID?
</p>

Hi, is it only PK that you're trying to pair with ID? I'd say - publish public key for each ID and sign whatever is relevant for each FW. Is it not possible in your case?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 16 Oct 2021 15:49:04 GMT):<br/>
*[baziorek](https://t.me/baziorek)* _via telegram_
Thanks for the answer.

1. I want to make sure that a device was not cloned and replaced. That's why I want to verify with something unchangeable. The ID is good candidate.
2. True, it can be done now: firmware ID can be converted into private key with e.g. sha256. And from the private key we can publish public key. But IMO it will not be secure - it would be easy to get private keys if the way of generation would be known.

So my question is - does anybody know better solution?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 16 Oct 2021 15:59:05 GMT):<br/>
*[GaroRobe](https://t.me/garorobe)* _via telegram_
I mean not to infer PK from ID at all - use an external (public?) table of ID/Public key. Then you'll be able to track validity of anything signed by device and bind it to ID, while PK will be unfetchable from ID. Is it not what you're trying to achieve?
</p>

Actually this is similar to how client certificates are managed for iot devices. Devices are issued TLS cert generated at a server. Device must present client cert to connect to server over TLS. If device is compromised, just revoke the client certificate and the device will not be able to connect to server.

Good experience results on how i make $7000 every week!!! This has been an incredible experience from day one! This wasn't my first time trading but honestly I didn’t know what to expect when I first joined. After much loss. God walked me through the entire process from start to finish, which was a HUGE plus! They made the entire process so easy and hassle-free! I’m very impressed! I will definitely be referring her to you all.

to track transactions, check what accounts are here, check balance, check blocks?

Something what Konrad made (currently live version is for different blockchain than Iroha):
https://testnet.diva.exchange
?

@Kheireddine : It is problem with `golang` installation. It must be specific version. You can try commands as in dockerfile:
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/349e7d79c4ec84f9e6438250fa179af8718d0c71/docker/develop/Dockerfile#L42
You should download different version of `golang`

Hello again @kuvaldini @baziorek
I tried to follow the steps described in the docker file and install `go version 1.14.2`. 
I have then to install `protoc-gen-go` with `apt install` because the command described in the dockerfile failed (`go get`).
Now I have this following error even though `go` is installed. Any solution please ? I have been trying to install Iroha with Burrow for 15 days without success.

@liralemur Few weeks ago @pawlak00 found bug in iroha-core code:
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/issues/1498
The problem is in multiple libraries, so it must be in iroha-core code.

Hi @liralemur,
Do You know anything about wallet for iroha 1? Is any new wallet developed/adapted for iroha 1? Currently I found only:
- https://github.com/soramitsu/iroha-wallet-js (last commit 7 months ago)
- https://github.com/claudiocandio/borsello (made by community, last commit 9 months ago)

I see that Soramitsu is developing wallet: https://fearlesswallet.io/ - are there any plans to integrate its with Iroha 1? Or maybe the last form about blockchain explorers was asked because You are planning to develop something for Iroha 1?
Or maybe there are plans to create Hyperledger * Wallet for all Hyperledgers' blockchains?

Hi! No, Fearless wallet is a project for Web3 foundation networks. 

I'm afraid that these wallets are the only ones available. There are no plans but the idea behind having client libraries was the possibility of every project to build the client apps (and wallets) the way they would like to.

Is any easy way (without building our own docker image after code modification) to use different name of config file than `config.docker` in official docker images? Or maybe there are environment variables to set up different file name?

Thanks for the link, but there are no information about changing name of config file.
I've tried:
`
docker run --name irohad_burrow_support     -d \
        --network=host  \
        -v /home/devops/config/:/opt/iroha_data -v /home/devops/blockchain_blocks:/home/blockchain_blocks/ \
        -e KEY="$(hostname)" \
        hyperledger/iroha-burrow:support-1.2.x \
        --config config.my_own_name   ##### <-------------- HERE`

without success. The only fast way to change is to create link to file, but it is dirty solution:(.

@liralemur It is my question You wanted me to ask about:
I see in documentation that deploying is not up to date: https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/develop/deploy/k8s-deployment.html
on the other hand I saw few commits recently here: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-deploy
so my question: is deploying working fine now, or not yet? Unfortunately I'm not specialist about Kubernetes or ansible so I can't recognise by just watching into code:D.

Hi to all. Currently I'm using Iroha 1.1.3 via docker. How can I migrate from one server to another with all history? Should I add blocks from block_storage of old server to the folder where genesis.block is for the new server?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 06 Nov 2021 06:37:45 GMT):<br/>
*[baziorek](https://t.me/baziorek)* _via telegram_
Hi,
If you have not many blocks You can try to run server without database WSV and read its from blocks. If You want to do its fast You can use migration script:
https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/develop/maintenance/restarting_node.html#changing-iroha-version-migration
but before You do anything copy all blocks
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sat, 06 Nov 2021 07:17:23 GMT):<br/>

Hi, thank you. 
Could you please explain your first suggestion?
I have the same configuration on the second server, the same genesis.block and I can take everything from blockstore to the new one.
What should I do in this case? Thank a lot in advance

Hi,
It will take time but I did like that:
1. I've stopped all containers (iroha and postgres).
2. I've copied all blocks
3. docker rename postgres_container postgres_container_old
4. docker run ... # running postgres container with proper configuration
5. docker run ... # with new image
6. ... wait ...

Hi, is there any way I can obtain why command called from smart contract did not passed validation? Let's say I wanted to add new account, but account name is already occupied, so validation failed with code 4 in create_account. Is there any possibility to get this error code? Because now I can't distinguish from failing because of nonexisitng domain and occupied name

Hello, I'm trying to deploy a Smart Contract using the python code available in the documentation.
I have the iroha-burrow:develop docker image installed. I have this STATEFUL_VALIDATION error when running the code:
('ENOUGH_SIGNATURES_COLLECTED', 9, 0)
('STATEFUL_VALIDATION_FAILED', 2, 2)
('REJECTED', 4, 0)
In the doc of "Call engine" command, it's mentioned that it's related to the permission. But I have already edited the "genesis_block" file and create a role with "root" permission and attached it to the default "admin@test" account. So I think it's enough.
Do you any other idea about the error ?

Hello. Sorry for double post, but my message was not bridged from RocketChat to gitter/telegram. I'm discussing a purpose of creating a network with many validators at #besu channel. What was the rationale behind making Iroha's YAC scalable?

Hi! Thank you for letting us know about the bridge with messages - unfortunately these things happen but I've asked to restart it, so it should be fixed soon.

About your question - if it's ok, I'll ask the team about it on Monday. They worked really hard yesterday (preparing the final stages of the release! 🥳) and definitely earned their weekends 😊 
Overall, from what I know, scalability is good in terms of decentralisation - and even if you do not want too many nodes, it's still good to have an option to add them with no risk to the performance (I hope I understood your question correctly).

Definitely. Thanks for looking into it! Yes, decentralisation is good, but it seem it's not as obvious for IBFT2's developers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmTUP_dWfME&t=3450s , so I wonder maybe Iroha team would have more use-cases for a larger number of validators?

*Toshihiko Okubo* _via telegram_
I have a question in an environment where burrow is integrated in iroha 1.3.0 now.

I have deployed a smart contract that has a view function that returns a value without changing the state of the chain.
Is it possible to execute this view function from CallEngine API and get the return value?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 19 Nov 2021 09:55:39 GMT):<br/>
*[baziorek](https://t.me/baziorek)* _via telegram_
If You want there should be docker image with burrow integration:
`
hyperledger/iroha-burrow:main
`
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 19 Nov 2021 10:12:41 GMT):<br/>
*Toshihiko Okubo* _via telegram_
thanks!

To explain a bit more, I have already completed the setup of iroha with burrow integration using Docker and deploying the contract.

What I wanted to know is if it is possible to deploy a contract like the one below and get the returned value using the CallEngineAPI.

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/contracts.html?highlight=view%20#view-functions
`
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.9.0;

contract C {
    function f(uint a, uint b) public view returns (uint) {
        return a * (b + 42) + block.timestamp;
    }
}`


The solidity implementation in the example/burrow-integration folder does not have such a case.
So I think that CallEngineAPI does not support view function calls at the moment!

Just to cfurther specify. I am using a docker container for Iroha and have already created a docker container for postgres, but connctivity isnt able to be established. The only way i have been able to establish a connection with the postgres container from withn the iroha container has been by using the some-postgres host (they are in the same docker network, this is why I can use the name of the container as a host)

@FAltamiranoZ I've newer run tests of Iroha:D, but if You want to connect between docker containers with localhost address You can change network of containers into `host`: 
```docker run ... --network=host ...
```after that address of containers would be `localhost`

Hi. If you are programming using querryies there should be one. All in docs. 
To observe current state there is a good facility Metrics. They could help.

Thanks for the reply, yes I am programming :)
I have looked over the queries and there are definitely queries to find the block at a certain height, but there doesn't seem to be a query to find the current maximum height. We could simply search up the chain until we find a height without a block but that seems inefficient...
Is there a good way to query the metrics server that you recommend? Or should I write my own wrapper class to return a single nice integer from that query
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Mon, 06 Dec 2021 23:35:03 GMT):<br/>
*[Kuvaldini](https://t.me/Kuvaldini)* _via telegram_
If there is no ability querying current height.. i wonder. Please read the docs about metrics - it is a simple Prometheus compatible http server. It is not intended to be used for users and expected to be hidden in private network.
I do not recommend to rely business logic on metrics in production.

If there is a query for current height, I certainly cannot spot it haha
It seems that getting the last block committed may be a difficult task otherwise?

Hello everyone! Is this chat alive )
</p>
<p><strong>vasiksim</strong> (Tue, 07 Dec 2021 20:07:59 GMT):<br/>
I have encountered some issue.. this one^ https://giters.com/hyperledger-archives/iroha/issues/1955 and wanted to know - how to fix it within iroha "getting started docker" variant?..
</p>
<p><strong>vasiksim</strong> (Tue, 07 Dec 2021 20:09:13 GMT):<br/>
Also tried to "create account' by api call but receieved smth like 
    "error": "Command response error: expected=COMMITTED, actual=STATELESS_VALIDATION_FAILED",
    "status": "STATELESS_VALIDATION_FAILED"
</p>

Hello! Please try official updated documentation (https://iroha.readthedocs.io/) and updated official repository in GitHub (https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha) because the link you've posted seems a little odd - first of all, it does not lead to GitHub apparently and it is definitely about archived version of Iroha.
</p>
<p><strong>vasiksim</strong> (Tue, 07 Dec 2021 20:17:14 GMT):<br/>
Oh thank you for the answer! 
The link may be odd but the problem persist.. I'm not sure if it's with the cli or also with the api for "create account" call.
I\ve checked - I'm using the latest image (down there is the docker run parameters) and also - I user the quick start guide from official link (

here is the command, so I think it takes the latest stable image:

sudo docker run --name iroha \
-d \
-p 50051:50051 \
-v /home/adminroot/iroha/example:/opt/iroha_data \
-v blockstore:/tmp/block_store \
--network=iroha-network \
-e KEY='node0' \
hyperledger/iroha:latest
</p>
<p><strong>vasiksim</strong> (Tue, 07 Dec 2021 20:28:43 GMT):<br/>
@sorabot also tried the "main" branch for the docker image - also failed from cli with one:

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'boost::wrapexcept<boost::bad_optional_access>'
  what():  Attempted to access the value of an uninitialized optional object.

Oh hello ) it's better in tgrm.. so the question is up - am I using a stable one with "hyperledger/iroha:latest"?.. So I get the error from this one on cli / by api .. Even if I use 'main' branch..

Hi, sure! The thing is that I am not very proficient in tech details - recently when I tried that guide it seemed to work fine. Can you share your logs maybe? I might not be able to help but at least we'll have something to show the people who could :)
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Tue, 07 Dec 2021 20:49:04 GMT):<br/>
*[Sara](https://t.me/liralemur)* _via telegram_
But overall stateless validation fail means the request was not sent correctly. Do other commands work for you?

That's good and bad at the same time. The thing is that CLI is not really a fully functioning tool - more like a thing to check how it generally works. So, I'm afraid it might be possible that it forms an incorrect request. Would you like to try that using Python library instead of CLI or I could check this tomorrow (I'm in a European time zone so it's rather late - or I could ask for some tech help tomorrow as well)?

It is actually a lot more helpful during European workday. Now it's only me and I am not, unfortunately, very good friend with CLI. If you want to play around though still, there's a Python Sandbox-like thing: https://www.katacoda.com/hyperledger-iroha/scenarios/iroha-transfer-asset if you would like to try Python easy way :) I am not sure how up-to-date it is but it is extremely easy (and generally seems to be working).

Hello everyone!
I'm trying to build rest-server on node.js (I've got a ready one from https://github.com/dominic-pa/iroha-rest-server) and when I try to call createAccount I get this one :
STATELESS_VALIDATION_FAILED
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 16 Dec 2021 19:14:49 GMT):<br/>
*[Василий К.](https://t.me/vasiksim)* _via telegram_
I'm pretty sure that my rest server works - I can send getAccount and receive a correct answer.. But I can't figure out what to do with createAccount .. or maybe with all POST requests
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Thu, 16 Dec 2021 19:17:21 GMT):<br/>
*[Василий К.](https://t.me/vasiksim)* _via telegram_
My headers are simple:
Content-Type:application/json
iroha-account-id:admin@test
iroha-account-key:f101537e319568c765b2cc89698325604991dca57b9716b58016b253506cab70

My body is written from Iroha docs:
{
    "accountName": "newtest1",
    "domainId": "test",
    "publicKey": "somekey"
}

My iroha instance is one from "QUick start guide" and it works (as I've written above - I can make GET requests)

'keys' you mean keys in headers?.. they trully work (they are default from the guide) as I can send Get requets and ALSO I can POST createAsset for example

Hi @Kuvaldini , I am trying to run this but always got error : ERROR >ERR in ./iroha-swarm.sh:258,            .metrics=\"$config_metrics\" " \

Is this something related to prometheus?

Genesis block is just a first block in your Blockchain - it is created when you create the network. The example is here: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/main/example/genesis.block 

The idea is to set up the necessary permissions, initial users - so that when the system is running you already have all the users with necessary permissions and keys. The example gives a pretty good idea on what it is, so I think it might be helpful to just analyse it.

You can enable trace logging to get more details. And can send log here. This could be helpful. Anyway try one of examples as they presented with iroha-python they work fine for sure. That add more sw layers.

We do not test Iroha on M1. There was GitHub issue with solution and  suggestions about how to build, and then run. So it could work. But no warranties. We recommend to use vamilla `image hyperledger/iroha:latest` from DockerHub.

praviously I've only updated `iroha.py` file (during the presentation), but today also protobuf and generated from protobuf files.

Hi, I’m studying iroha for a project, but I have some problems on the assets part. In the case scenario there are some reference about create a relationship between user and asset id, or as well store medical documentation into user details… but seems that assets are just for digital value with not “schemaless” structure and the user details can be changed/updated from the user than own these details. How could assign a document/values to a user in a permanent way? Like a diploma or blood exams values. Thanks

can_set_detail
Allows setting account detail.

The permission allows setting details to other accounts. Another way to set detail without can_set_detail permission is to grant can_set_my_account_detail permission to someone. In order to grant, transaction creator should have can_grant_can_set_my_account_detail permission.

Note

Transaction creator can always set detail for own account even without that permission.

Hello everybody!  
We have such a case:
 The user of the application (Account A) places an order for the sale of an asset in the public space (the Buyer has not yet been determined), after another User (Account B) accepts this request (the Buyer has been determined), a Transaction Package must be created,
 1st transaction - transfer of an asset (Stock) from Account A to Account B (signed by Account A when signing the purchase and sale agreement)
 2nd transaction - transfer of an asset (Money) from Account B to Account A (signed by Account B when signing the purchase and sale agreement) Question: How is a transaction package created?  Or is this package created by the Application (Client) and sent to User A and User B for signature?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Sun, 02 Jan 2022 20:08:23 GMT):<br/>

Two transactions must be completed at the same time, but users can sign their transactions at different times (when they enter the application / client)

Hi. You should consider Transactions Batches at iroha.readthedocs.com 
Users must sign transactions on their sides then they could be merged ti one batch. 
2. Other more advanced way. Create batch then sign. I am not sure if iroha accepts a batch of unsigned transactions to be signed later.. (..looking for info in my memory..) It should. At least if multi signature transactions enabled and quorum is greater than 1. So you may create a batch of transactions. They will be delayed waiting for users' signatoeies

That is, the application (client) sends through its channels an offer to users to create signed transactions, and then combines these transactions into a batch and sends them for execution to Torii?  If so, then a vulnerability arises because transactions are not signed inside Iroha and on the way to Torii they can be intercepted and modified.  Sorry for the possibly incorrect assumptions.

As I understand it, multisig is added to the account that creates the transaction, not to the transaction.  In order for the transaction to be carried out, it must be signed by, say, 2 users who are specified in the account quorum.  The user account is a personal account on which his assets are recorded and, accordingly, it is incorrect to attach an additional signer to his account.

Look at the batch transaction example in the iroha repo. Bob and Alice each only signs their own transaction in the batch. The trick is each of them need two keys. One to create the transaction and one to sign the transaction.

Hello!
Did I understand correctly that a user can add an additional signature to his account?
Let's say the first signature will be used to create transactions, and the second signature will be used to confirm transactions.
And both of these signatures will belong to the same user.
It's like that?

Hi. I'm doing some experiments with Iroha and VANETs. I need to add and remove peers dynamically. I'm using python API to do that. I have four docker containers running iroha smoothly. I've started another one and submitted a add_peer command. Sometimes it works, sometimes the network freezes with something like this:
"...

Does anybody has a clue for me? Thank you very much.

Iroha v1 focuses on digital payments and for some things like systemically important payments systems, you don't want EVM-style smart contracts, because you don't want your system to be hacked

Hi,
I'd like to ask about project Bakong project - are all users in the same Iroha network, or in multiple of them? I'm asking, because according to Wikipedia there ate 15 288 489 people, so without children let's assume there are 10 000 000 accounts. 
According to speed in tests (https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/iroha/Release+1.3.0) there are about 230 ATPS, but in the whitepaper (https://www.nbc.org.kh/download_files/research_papers/khmer/NBC_BAKONG_White_Paper.pdf) is information about 1000-2000 TPS. 
So if we want to perform transactions for all accounts in single network it would take: 1.4 - 2.7 hours (according to Whitepaper) and about 12 hours (according to Iroha 1.3 performance tests).

Currently I'm thinking about similar problem - what to do if I need 10 mln users - if single network is good solution, or multiple of them are necessarily with connection with e.g. HL Cactus.

Bakong uses a single network, running on high performance servers. The Iroha speed tests are still a bit conservative, as the transactions may not be generated at capacity.

And another question (if it is not top secret) - what was the Iroha version when the performance tests were performed? The paper has date "June 2020" so I assume it was probably 1.1.3. As I remember it was 40 TPS, then version 1.2 had ~4 TPS.

The benchmark results taht were published a long time ago with 1.2 are not reliable as the benchmarking script only sent transactions sequentially, waiting for confirmation of each transaction, and not in parallel. This was fixed in the more recent benchmark scripts

Let's say a domain with the “accountant” role can add only money to Iroha, and a domain with the “manager” role can add only company shares to Iroha.

You can limit an account to only add/subtract assets in its own domain. So you'll need to put shares and money in two different domains

Hi everyone! I got a bit of a noob question, hope you can help me out!
So, I have followed the documentation step by step up until step 7.1
I already have the Docker containers for Hyperledger Iroha and PostgreSQL deployed and running (Attached some images about test results for hyperledger Iroha and actual containers)
However, I am now trying to launch irohad by using the following commands from the this path "/opt/iroha/iroha": 
./build/bin/irohad --config config.docker --genesis_block genesis.block --keypair_name node0. However, it throws the following error: "Failed reading the configuration: File 'config.docker' could not be read"
./irohad --config config.docker --genesis_block genesis.block --keypair_name node0. However, it throws the following error: "Permission denied"
I guess the issue is that I am not launching irohad correctly, but I don't know how I should be launching it, could someone please help me with it?
If there is anymore info I can provide in order to make this easier just let me know! (I'll also attach how the path "/opt/iroha/iroha" and the path "/opt/iroha/iroha/example" and the config.docker file looks)

Hi,
When You are running command from documentation in current directory (which should be directory where You typed: `git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha.git`) it is copying the `config.docker` file to the container.

When You are running iroha with docker You don't need to call command `./irohad --config config.docker --genesis_block genesis.block --keypair_name node0` by Your own, because it is being called with script `entrypoint.sh`, which is copied to the docker instance.

So in easier words:
1. `git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha.git`
2. stay in the directory where You called `git clone ...`
2. `docker run --name iroha ...` (according to [documentation](https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/develop/getting_started/index.html#starting-iroha-container))
3. You can check logs if everything is working.

Hi!
So, I have already ran these steps and the docker container was already up and running, and according to the logs (the 1st picture), everything is alright.
However, whenever I try to run the pyhton file that is in this part of the documentation (https://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/develop/getting_started/python-guide.html) I get the following errors:
PS C:\Users\polup> & C:/Users/polup/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python310/python.exe d:/Tesis/Tesis/Python/Test.py

I thought this was because of irohad not running and this is why I wanted to launch it, but if that's not the case, how can I run this python file? (I have already followed all documentation steps up until now)

Thanks for the tip! it helped to solve the problem, but another one popped up. So, instead of bringing them all out I referenced them within the command like this:
./build/bin/irohad --config example/config.docker --genesis_block example/genesis.block --keypair_name example/node0
However, it now throws this new error, got any idea on what it could be?

Sooo, it turns out that the only thing that was needed to solve this last error was to reboot the container.
For future reference, whenever the build is finished, one must reset it, and then try to run irohad like that, otherwise, the same error pops up

Hi! Here are performance tests for 1.3 - I hope they could help: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/plugins/servlet/mobile?contentId=62228599#content/view/62228599 

Performance generally depends on the configuration (in the docs we marked the settings that affect performance) and the machines you use.

I saw it, but I'm interested in, let's say, a request for account assets.  How many such requests and responses per second can I get?  Or is a request also considered a transaction, like a command?

*[Alexander Lednev](https://t.me/iceseer)* _via telegram_
It depends on: 
- the request type. For example GetAccountAssetTransactions uses only the current snapshot of blockchain state, but GetTransactions request also reads transactions data from block store and it is much slower;
- used database. RocksDB much faster, also we uses additional cache for user states, permissions, balances, network state etc in this setup;
- your hardware.

Some few weeks ago I saw some testimonials about Amellia strategy and confirmed withdrawal made. I was so skeptic because I have been falling from one scam to another and was not ready to fall victim again. Because I was scared but after much thinking I gave her a chance, and I discover that I also got my own withdrawal as well, those of you at there trying hard to invest but not getting paid, I advise you to give her a try also and see for yourself,  you can reach her through

I'm looking at Hyperledger Iroha and trying to grok how it compares to Ledger.com Nano X. I've Googled and haven't found a direct comparison. Can anyone point me in the right direction?
</p>
<p><strong>dave-beck</strong> (Sun, 23 Jan 2022 17:29:14 GMT):<br/>
At first glance, it looks like nano x has an SDK associated with a purchasable piece of hardware whereas iroha could be used to implement something akin to the nano X on your own hardware.

Hi everyone! Just to let you know that with the help of @Kuvaldini I was finally able to solve this error.
What happened was that the directory /temp/block_store was owned by root, and therefore, non-accesible by a normal user.
To solve this, it was neccesary to acces the docker container with a user that had root permissions, go to the aforementioned directory, and run this command: "chown -R iroha-ci /tmp/block_store"
With that, Irohad was finally able to access the directory and work as intended.

Hello!

I’m playing with Iroha for some time for now. Get consfused about adding new peers to existing network.

I’ve one node and try to add another one, both on different vps

As I understand, both node should have the same genesis block to sync correctly.

But when I put both ip addresses (external), first node can’t connect to itself

Does that mean I should stick with 127.0.0.1 address in config, and then add peer manually using command?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 13:37:41 GMT):<br/>
*[Kuvaldini](https://t.me/Kuvaldini)* _via telegram_
No. Peers list is same to all nodes. 127.00.1 is not what will help you

<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 13:38:56 GMT):<br/>

If I’ve for example networf of 3 nodes, each of them in genesis block. And want to add 4 node - should I use addPeer command?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 13:55:24 GMT):<br/>
*[Pavel](https://t.me/proksi21)* _via telegram_
Or 4th node will sync by itself using info from genesis block?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 13:55:57 GMT):<br/>

Yes add peer is what you need?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 13:56:40 GMT):<br/>
*[Pavel](https://t.me/proksi21)* _via telegram_
So first add peer using any of 3 nodes, and then launch 4th, correct?
</p>
<p><strong>sorabot</strong> (Fri, 28 Jan 2022 13:58:16 GMT):<br/>

Hi! We discussed this a little - can I please ask for some delay with this? Seems like we'll need the isi interface or something similar anyway (it was supposed to be a repo for results of a mentorship project - I'll contact the intern to ask her to make a PR for this). I'm not sure about the migration tool yet too.

To make the problem clear:

Someone correct me if I’m wrong :). IIRC, Ursa implemenation of ed25519 is different from Iroha default. The JS library is probably using ed25519_sha3. You probably need to change the JS to use a version of ed25519 compatible with Ursa.

That’s right, Iroha default is ed25519_sha3, and Ursa is ed25519_sha2

JS library uses tweetnacl for that, but smth is wrong with signature length

similar logs every day. The problem is that the network has only *single node*. Version is:
`
$ docker images -a --digests --no-trunc
REPOSITORY                 TAG       DIGEST                                                                    IMAGE ID                                                                  CREATED        SIZE

The network has: 151 590 blocks. The only thing I suspect is week VPS server: single core, 1G RAM. I don't know how to inwestigate the problem. The network some time ago contained 4 nodes, but now it has only one.
We have another network with 3 nodes, the same version and docker containers are not dying.
Does anybody know how to face the problem? It can't stop every day

It is usually 500-600M RAM consumption, Iroha about 200 M. When I query consumption is increasing but I never seen using too much memory.

Hi everybody!

I found this in docs about block structure:
"rejected transactions hashes — array of transaction hashes, which did not pass stateful validation step; this field is optional"

Questions:
1) Is it disabled by default?
2) If no, how to disable it, because it may become an attack vector?
</p>

And I also have question about YAC.

Let’s imagine we’ve 4 peers A B C D in our network. Peer B is chosen to sign block and during this operation it goes offline. What will happen? All three peers will wait ’til peer B goes online again or there’s some kind of timer for that situation?

If you contributed to the code in 2021 you could have a souvenir from Hyperledger — it includes stickers and other small things to remember your journey with HL in 2021 by :) 

If you contributed to the code in 2021, want to get a souvenir and haven't receive an email about that before, please contact me with your email, so I could forward it to the HL team!
