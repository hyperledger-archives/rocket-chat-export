I have started to put the Wiki page together for Hyperledger Labs: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/labs. I would appreciate your input @labs-stewards
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 13:56:58 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt look good :thumbsup: 
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 13:58:39 GMT):<br/>
Thinking we might add to the wiki something outlining how a proposal can be made.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 16:38:49 GMT):<br/>
Agree @trbs - Any thoughts? 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 19:53:54 GMT):<br/>
Looks like there are two likely candidates 1. Cicero 2. Crypto library - nothing definite yet
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 20:28:17 GMT):<br/>
The governance part of the proposal seems relevant. (copy some of that working in the wiki page)

</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 20:36:10 GMT):<br/>
How exactly do we want to process to work ? In governance it hints to the accepting process to go through a PR. Something like a PR or wiki page or mail to ML, so people are able to use that to publish the request to the stewards and for everybody to keep track of it..
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 20:37:56 GMT):<br/>
Talking about keeping track of things... Do we want to have some kind of status page (wiki) or document in git (could be the same repo for the PR to be filled against) or similar to keep track of the lab projects over time ? Or keeping it lightweight for now and see how that goes and only put things in place when we need it.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 02:53:07 GMT):<br/>
@trbs : does this cover what you are looking for https://wiki.hyperledger.org/labs#proposals. Happy to expand table.

@vishwasrao : Hyperledger Labs aims at providing a space (i.e., GitHub repos) where work can easily be started without the creation of an official Hyperledger project. Is there a particular lab that you would like to propose?

@lehors saw your activity in labs, nice to do a dry run!

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 16:24:15 GMT):<br/>
Are labs getting any interest at the hackfest- What about the crypto library
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 21:16:48 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/labs?msg=goamxzh637KRtA3Qn) @VipinB Hart says he's been told the crypto library really ought to become a project
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 21:16:59 GMT):<br/>
but Mic has a proposal that he wants to make
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 21:17:11 GMT):<br/>
so he's going to be our guinea pig
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 21:28:38 GMT):<br/>
are there any expectations about naming conventions for projects? i know there is no HL branding... just want to make sure there are no other expectations...
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 21:53:04 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman name of repository hews to name of lab- (from template) - Should be unique (cant call it "Linux" or "Fabric" for example)- this is just common sense- these are very low barriers.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 21:54:18 GMT):<br/>
thanks, vipin...
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 22:13:30 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman @VipinB : It does not have to start with lab- since it in the github.com/hyperledger-labs organization.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 22:26:20 GMT):<br/>
i'm sure it will be "pdo" or something like that
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 22:39:22 GMT):<br/>
I didn't mean it has to start with lab @tkuhrt -meaning repo and lab have the same name...
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 22:46:55 GMT):<br/>
ah...yes.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 20:19:05 GMT):<br/>

@VipinB PDO == private data objects, its an "offchain" smart contract environment that uses SGX to ensure privacy/confidentiality; the ledger looks a lot like the GSL from a year ago
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 28 Feb 2018 17:12:37 GMT):<br/>
Any relation to TownCrier @MicBowman 
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 28 Feb 2018 17:16:51 GMT):<br/>
not really... fan was my intern last summer & we can write contracts using attestations generated by TC... but other than the fact that they both use SGX... no relationship

<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 18:26:13 GMT):<br/>
Hi, @albertocuriel I did not see your pull request in https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io. Did you follow the process outlined here: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/blob/master/README.md
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 18:26:21 GMT):<br/>
Or am I missing something
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 18:57:29 GMT):<br/>
the last hangup we have for submitting the pdo proposal is that our legal wants to clear the name... i'm assuming we can change the name of the lab later if we need to?
</p>
<p><strong>albertocuriel</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 19:31:58 GMT):<br/>
@vipinb thank you
</p>
<p><strong>albertocuriel</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 19:33:21 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt  yes, I followed the instructions there. https://github.com/m3m3m3m3/hyperledger-labs.github.io/pull/1   am I missing something? thanks
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 19:34:35 GMT):<br/>
Note that you are in m3m3m3m3 and not hyperledger-labs
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 19:34:43 GMT):<br/>
^ @albertocuriel 
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 19:34:59 GMT):<br/>
So we cannot see that in https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io
</p>
<p><strong>albertocuriel</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 19:35:00 GMT):<br/>
oops
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 19:35:51 GMT):<br/>
Also, we would not want to delete the existing template, but rather copy the template to a new file which would then be part of the pull request
</p>
<p><strong>albertocuriel</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 19:52:04 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt  , thank you . ok I just added the pull request on hyperledger.  https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/pull/9
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 20:20:13 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt @lehors @VipinB  Just created the PR for the private data objects lab as well
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 20:42:15 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman : One minor comment added
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 21:21:16 GMT):<br/>
@albertocuriel Please fill out "Initial committers"/ "Sponsor" and "Prexisting repository" if any; also let us try to rework the "manifesto" into engineering terms if possible
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 21:37:49 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman pdo seems well thought out
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 21:38:16 GMT):<br/>
@albertocuriel I have made some comments
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 21:40:55 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt fixed the spelling error & pushed new commit
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 21:41:49 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB we should have a more complete overview by the end of next week
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 22:29:47 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman : Thanks. Another question surrounding the github repo. Obviously still some work to do on your side. Would you want us to create a repo or just do a transfer of the Intel repo?
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 22:30:08 GMT):<br/>
Maybe I should add this as a question to the PR so we have history of it
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 22:30:29 GMT):<br/>
best to create a new one
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 22:30:41 GMT):<br/>
Okay.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 22:30:43 GMT):<br/>
we are using the intel github right now
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 22:30:57 GMT):<br/>
i'm not too worried about preserving history... though we could work that as well
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 22:31:19 GMT):<br/>
this is going through the research repo --> internal candidate repo --> hl labs
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 22:31:25 GMT):<br/>
so things are already kind of messy
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 22:32:03 GMT):<br/>
Great...I will make a comment on the PR that a new repo would be created and then you or one of the other committers would do the migration.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 22:33:36 GMT):<br/>
other than that, I gave it a +1. We will let @VipinB @lehors and @trbs have a look and comment

@tkuhrt @vipinb It is my first time using git.  I am using github on the browser. I have a basic question. I realize now that when the Hyperledge instructions says "Fork the hyperledger-labs.github.io repository." you are not saying "press the fork button in that page". you a re saying "press the create file button".  Now when you say git commit -amend -s if not, you will need to squash your commit into a single commit and sign off (how to doall of the https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io  webpage?

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 12:30:49 GMT):<br/>
If that proposal had a proper sponsor then I would be questioning the sponsor.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 15:33:06 GMT):<br/>
This proposal keeps coming back
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 15:33:35 GMT):<br/>
I had questioned the premise
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 15:33:48 GMT):<br/>
Before, I have not read the current proposal
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 15:37:19 GMT):<br/>
Does not seem very different this time either
</p>
<p><strong>albertocuriel</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 18:46:05 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt @VipinB  @Dan. Dear Sirs/Madamme, the last 4 weeks we were trying to let you know our proposal for improvement using Hyperledger. We looked first as an associate project, with hyperledger, but the foundation reffer us to submit it to the hypeprledger lab becuase it was simpler and for this kind of projects.To fill the pull that is is why in the sponsorship field, we added our data to be able to send the proposal for your read. WE know what what we are going is revolutionary and makes what  you are currently unable to do with any current blockchain.As IBM partners for Blockcain we submitted the proposal for Hyperledger consideration. He have found easy, open collaboration from other industrial players. We thank you for your time. It is a pitty that yHyperledger could read and study our proposal in that time. Unfortunately Hyperledger seems that not a desired blockchain solution.Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>albertocuriel</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 18:53:34 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt @VipinB @Dan correction::  coudnt read the poposal in that time. 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 18:58:16 GMT):<br/>
I did read the proposal
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 18:59:17 GMT):<br/>
Not changed the way we asked in the first place
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 19:35:24 GMT):<br/>
unlike @Dan I wouldn't necessarily declare this proposal out of scope because it is simply too vague for me to be able to make that determination but independently of that, this proposal still fails to meet the basic requirements set by our process, including having a sponsor who's Hyperledger project maintainer
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 19:35:51 GMT):<br/>
@albertocuriel while I can understand your frustration I would advise you to seek for such a sponsor
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 19:36:11 GMT):<br/>
of course it will require for you to engage and explain what your project really entails
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 19:38:09 GMT):<br/>
but I'm sure such a discussion would benefit everybody - this would help you better describe what your lab proposal is about and help us understanding how it fits within the scope of hyperleger
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 19:39:11 GMT):<br/>
the kind of flippant statement a la "Unfortunately Hyperledger seems that not a desired blockchain solution" doesn't help anyone
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 22:14:00 GMT):<br/>
@lehors @albertocuriel I had made the same comments for an earlier PR- maybe not as a requirement that you need a sponsor, but we need a concrete proposal with a little bit of definition; I even offered to help you write it out, if language was an issue. 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 22:16:30 GMT):<br/>
I am all for stretching the bounds of the possible and out of the box thinking- we need a path towards implementation for this to be a lab

is there a way to create enterprise crypto with hyperledger?. We are planning to use Fabric but need to generate enterprise Crypto for this project. For now, plan is to develop on Fabric and then later integrate with Crypto generator. Ex: Like Stellar or any other Crypto platform.. Any advice please..
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 18:21:23 GMT):<br/>
@SummerLotus @hartm has a plan for a crypto-lib, I believe he is organizing regular calls around this. Do not know exactly what is meant by enterprise crypto.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 03 Apr 2018 19:08:19 GMT):<br/>
@SummerLotus We are planning a Hyperledger crypto-lib project.  I don't know exactly what you mean by Enterprise crypto, but feel free to check out the crypto-lib rocket chat channel for more information on that.

Is it possible to have a mailing list for a labs project?  I'm not sure what the policy on this is, and I can't find anything in the wiki.  Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 12:54:43 GMT):<br/>
IIRC I think we discussed having one labs mailing list for all of labs. 
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 17:50:25 GMT):<br/>
There should be one of those alreay, @Dan - https://lists.hyperledger.org/mailman/listinfo/hyperledger-labs
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 17:50:25 GMT):<br/>
There should be one of those already, @Dan - https://lists.hyperledger.org/mailman/listinfo/hyperledger-labs
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 09 Apr 2018 17:51:42 GMT):<br/>
@hartm : As Dan mentioned, we had decided one mailing list and one chat channel for all labs. If it becomes necessary to break that out (due to one lab being really vocal), then we can decide to do that.

out some point we should report to the TSC on the labs related activities
</p>

I know this is something we (the stewards) signed up to do
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 10 May 2018 15:01:54 GMT):<br/>
I think it was like on a quaterly basis but I don't know when that starts @tkuhrt do you know?
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 10 May 2018 15:20:27 GMT):<br/>
We don't really have a schedule on that yet, @lehors 
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 10 May 2018 15:20:37 GMT):<br/>
Do we think we are ready for an update?
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 10 May 2018 15:21:23 GMT):<br/>
I am happy to start a wiki page that begins to provide an update that we can edit.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 10 May 2018 15:37:51 GMT):<br/>
@stewards : With the addition of Ry as a community architect, I was wondering if we should add him as a steward for labs. In the original proposal, we mentioned community architect(s) would be stewards. Is this something we can decide or is this something that we should take to the TSC for input.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 10 May 2018 16:27:18 GMT):<br/>
https://wiki.hyperledger.org/labs/2018-q2-update -- what else should we add to this?
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 12:21:36 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt sorry for late reply. Makes sense to me to add Ry (if he wants)
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 12:24:46 GMT):<br/>
Update lgtm. Thanks for writing that up. Was looking at that we had 25 PR's closed but most are not really interesting to mention :smiley: 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 15 May 2018 13:10:33 GMT):<br/>
I am for adding @rjones - I agree that this is good to do as he is now a Community Architect
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 15 May 2018 15:29:43 GMT):<br/>
If we do we should mention in the update doc.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 15 May 2018 17:25:41 GMT):<br/>
Not a lab steward, but +1 for adding Ry.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 16 May 2018 15:10:26 GMT):<br/>
As a tsc member @hartm your opinion counts more than lab stewards' - the interesting question is whether we should bring this to tsc. I need to look at the charter for labs to see whether this is possible without tsc approval- I believe it should be.
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Wed, 16 May 2018 23:35:51 GMT):<br/>
For all the ways one could have uttered that sentence that it's hard to imaging not being able to find a more pleasant and less arrogant way...
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 15:21:32 GMT):<br/>
@trbs apologies if it came through as arrogant.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 15:21:49 GMT):<br/>
From the charter: The following people have been approved by the TSC to be Labs Stewards. Please do not add your name unless you have been approved by the TSC to be a new Labs Steward. 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 15:22:14 GMT):<br/>
So looks like we need approval from tsc to add Lab Stewards according to the charter
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 18:37:19 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for finding that note, @VipinB 
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 18 May 2018 18:37:32 GMT):<br/>
Sounds like we need to send an email to the TSC mailing list.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 16:44:13 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB @lehors : Any changes to the update for Labs (https://wiki.hyperledger.org/labs/2018-q2-update)? If not, I will send email off to TSC list on this.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 22:20:16 GMT):<br/>
@lehors @VipinB @trbs : Thoughts on creating Jira projects under jira.hyperledger.org? I have been asked to do so for Private Data Objects. I was under the impression that labs would be separate from projects and would use Github issues. But I would appreciate opinions/thoughts.
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 22:30:16 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt @stewards on the quarterly update; thoughts on maybe also adding the names of the lab proposals "in progress" and "out of scope/withdrawn" ? (maybe just the names, without further description) Otherwise LTGM :-)
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 22:31:29 GMT):<br/>
Yes...could add the links to the PRs for `in progress` and `out of scope/withdrawn`
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 22:32:54 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt the idea for the labs was to be less strict/formal for this kinda stuff right ? thought they would (mostly) use github issues as well... I don't see the harm of them using Jira if they want, only that since this takes time & effort it should maybe only be done if there is a reasonable certainty that it will be used ? (otherwise seems like an unwanted burden for the Jira maintainers)
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 15:19:30 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt @stewards was out of commission for a while. Hope the update went well today...
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 15:31:45 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB : Hope you are well. We haven't done the update yet. I was waiting to hear back from you and @lehors before sending to the TSC.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 24 May 2018 15:37:05 GMT):<br/>
In my opinion the less gating factors we have, the better. Since labs was conceived of that way.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 14:53:19 GMT):<br/>
Mild preference for using jira. That way if the lab becomes a project it is already using the right infrastructure and processes.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 15:34:06 GMT):<br/>
Do we have a mail list for labs? I don't see one at lists.hyperledger.org but wouldn't be the first time I missed a link that was staring me in the face.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 29 May 2018 16:39:01 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 14:12:22 GMT):<br/>
I do NOT think we should offer Jira support to the labs
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 14:13:55 GMT):<br/>
the whole idea is to offer a lightweight process and it seems to me that this would add a burden to the organizations resources
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 14:14:41 GMT):<br/>
but we could possibly raise this as a question to the TSC
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 14:16:57 GMT):<br/>
I agree with @Dan's point that allowing them to use Jira would ease transition in case a lab becomes a project eventually
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 14:17:42 GMT):<br/>
but unless we expect this to be the norm rather than the exception I don't know that it is worth it
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 14:19:21 GMT):<br/>
also I don't know where we'd draw the line, what if a project wants to use Gerrit rather than Github (so that "if the lab becomes a project it is already using the right infrastructure and processes" ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 31 May 2018 15:18:26 GMT):<br/>
Together we can save people from Gerrit, one project at a time. ;)

@MicBowman well, once code is contributed to a lab I would expect the participants to stop using whatever internal tool they were using before
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 18:34:32 GMT):<br/>
unless you expect the LF staff to import your JIRA database I don't know how that makes a difference
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 18:37:03 GMT):<br/>
I guess I don't understand the point
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 04 Jun 2018 18:37:49 GMT):<br/>
I do agree it would be easier to offer JIRA to those used to it and I'm not really against it if the staff think it's easy enough and is willing to do the extra work

initial committer should list the id/email address
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 15:07:23 GMT):<br/>
we went through that for other labs, getting them to add that info
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 15:07:29 GMT):<br/>
so we ought to be consistent :)
</p>

<p><strong>DanielMcSheehy</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 15:21:33 GMT):<br/>
@lehors Thank you! To clarify, you want me to make a new PR to add what kind of an id? Then add email address for initial committers and sponsors? 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 15:25:47 GMT):<br/>
github ids
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 15:26:00 GMT):<br/>
that's what the template calls for as a matter of fact
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 15:26:36 GMT):<br/>
and you can see how others have done it: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/blob/master/labs/SParts.md
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 15:34:46 GMT):<br/>
Created https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-chrome-extension -- I added @DanielMcSheehy github ID to the project
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 15:36:23 GMT):<br/>
And then I read the above where we want to add Github ID to the .md file
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 15:38:00 GMT):<br/>
that's ok, we can still do it
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 15:38:29 GMT):<br/>
will try to be more careful next time
</p>

@lehors @tkuhrt @trbs new lab proposal for z-mix came in I have already +1  the lab... Looks like they conform with template including committers github names etc. 
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 20:13:39 GMT):<br/>
z-mix lgtm as well. In general (not specifically for z-mix) I wouldn't mind a bit more information (eg; how are they planning to deliver this ? something like libzmix.so or bindings or is it golang only ?) but we did not require that for other labs so +1 from me :smiley: 
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 20:14:24 GMT):<br/>
btw are we checking with the sponsors before merging the PR's ?
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Wed, 13 Jun 2018 20:14:44 GMT):<br/>
(tbh i have not contacted a sponsor to verify a PR before)
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 14 Jun 2018 15:27:34 GMT):<br/>
I heard on the cryptolib call that at least one sponsor (hart) is supporting them

@all : 2FA will soon be required across all GitHub orgs. If you do not have 2FA enabled for your account, you will be automatically removed from the Hyperledger org and will need to be re-added. Please check to ensure you have 2FA enabled. https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 13 Jul 2018 22:58:48 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 22:59:41 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB there is only https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/labs/topics , but it has only ever had 7 threads, so I think it could handle a discussion for stewards without much work. We could use #stewards perhaps?

@lehors : How could you not sign-off your commit. :)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 23:55:22 GMT):<br/>
but I did!
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 23:55:35 GMT):<br/>
the DCO checkout doesn't recognize it
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 23:55:35 GMT):<br/>
the DCO check doesn't recognize it
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 23:55:54 GMT):<br/>
is it because it's got some spurious leading spaces?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 23:57:01 GMT):<br/>
(side note: I really don't know why people love github... )
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 02 Aug 2018 23:57:54 GMT):<br/>
DCO is always fun to try to figure out what went wrong
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 00:00:17 GMT):<br/>
It looks the same as your other previous sign offs
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 00:02:32 GMT):<br/>
@rjones do you see any issues? Or should we ask Jessica
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 00:08:07 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 01:13:28 GMT):<br/>
_right before I force pushed the fix_
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 12:36:34 GMT):<br/>
it is the leading whitespace btw
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 12:37:45 GMT):<br/>
@lehors I thought you had pushed a fix. Do you want the PR merged? I can over-ride the DCO whitespace issue. You could also fix it by force pushing from your command line client.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 12:38:19 GMT):<br/>
this exact issue tripped up @Mari499 - you can't edit commit messages in the GitHub UI.

</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 13:48:39 GMT):<br/>
the PR doesn't seem to have changed
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 13:49:23 GMT):<br/>
so, I think the best is to ignore the bogus DCO error report and move forward
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 14:24:07 GMT):<br/>
OK.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 18:00:02 GMT):<br/>
Hey, @lehors @ry. I see that the PR was merged. When I was going to create the lab, I noticed a bit of discrepancy between the lab name and the file name. File name is hyperledger-docs-cn.md and lab name is Fabric Docs CN.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 18:00:19 GMT):<br/>
I would like to get this resolved. Is the lab only for Hyperledger Fabric documentation?
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 18:00:35 GMT):<br/>
If so, can we rename the file to fabric-docs-cn.md?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 18:00:39 GMT):<br/>
yes, I think that's correct
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 18:00:52 GMT):<br/>
Okay...let me do a PR to fix that
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 18:00:59 GMT):<br/>
and then I will create the lab
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 18:01:15 GMT):<br/>
sounds good, I didn't detect the problem with the filename but you're right
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 03 Aug 2018 18:01:34 GMT):<br/>
I didn't catch it either until I was getting ready to create the lab

So from my understanding, the Hyperledger Labs is for projects now quite ready to be put forth as Incubation. Is there a #toolshed for those projects not quite ready for #labs ?
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 14:40:05 GMT):<br/>
@wdmason: From [wiki page on Labs](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/labs):
> The [current Hyperledger Project Lifecycle](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/community/project-lifecycle) provides for projects to be started in Incubation and graduate from there to Active projects. Hyperledger Labs provides a space where work can easily be started without the creation of an official Hyperledger project.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 14:40:32 GMT):<br/>
Labs is a space for things not ready for incubation.
</p>
<p><strong>wdmason</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 14:41:16 GMT):<br/>
Thank you. I've been actually studying those documents. In fact, I've already updated my repo with a issue around that project lifecycle.

<p><strong>wdmason</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 14:42:37 GMT):<br/>
I've been searching for months for a framework to base my project on. Git has been it for the last while, and now Hyperledger is going to be the guidance. We are currently in the Conception phase.
</p>
<p><strong>wdmason</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 14:42:50 GMT):<br/>
That's why it's in the garage or toolshed rather than even in the Lab.
</p>
<p><strong>wdmason</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 14:43:23 GMT):<br/>
There are no collaborators as yet. No sponsors. I have yet to make myself known to the community as a whole. This is where it begins.
</p>
<p><strong>wdmason</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 14:44:38 GMT):<br/>
It makes no sense to start from scratch. Hyperledger has already done the heavy lifting. Now, it's simply a matter of following the best of the protocol as it has evolved to this point.

Hello everyone, in recent days I spoke with Arnaud on LinkedIn about a project that we released (Framework for Smart Contract Systems)  and he recommended us to propose it in labs. I have a question, how is the project handled or governance once it has been accepted? :slight_smile: 
</p>
<p><strong>dijun</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 16:22:40 GMT):<br/>
Hi, I would like to propose a new lab, blockly-chaincode. 
blockly-chaincode is based on Blockly, the web-based, graphical programming editor. It provides specific blocks and code generators for chaincode design. You can simply drag blocks together to design your own chaincode.
It is appreciated if you could review README here
https://github.com/flyinox/flyinox.github.io
And you can have a try here
https://flyinox.github.io/
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 17:55:21 GMT):<br/>

I think there were some minor miscommunications in this lab proposal (https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/pull/49). Mainly that it pasted the PDO description instead of it's own. What do the stewards think about requiring the sponsor to also approve the PR? That would enforce active participation from the sponsor (and assurance that he/she/they had actually sponsored it).
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 21:11:16 GMT):<br/>
Crap! I would be all for that, @Dan 
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 21:11:38 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 20:51:28 GMT):<br/>
Some of these metrics are quite puzzling like for example we have for crypto-lib
 dhuseby	2	2018-Sep-29	2018-Sep-29	54201	54197 
That is on one day Sep-29-2018 he added 54201 and deleted 54197- What does this mean?
Also cryptolib has now graduated to ursa.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 20:54:14 GMT):<br/>
For this TSC report, we should focus on the overall picture of the labs. Focus on the more successful projects and then on lessons learnt. Very difficult to tell about the success or efficacy just based on commit statistics which seem to be the main driver of this granular report.

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 21:04:24 GMT):<br/>
the insights tab seems to have lots of interesting metrics, including "traffic" where applicable- also we should exclude the commits that were done to get the lab into our github framework-and see whether there are activities that persist beyond just the creation period
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 22:50:58 GMT):<br/>
Agree...that we should only include non-setup commits
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 22:51:30 GMT):<br/>
I did that on the first report: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/labs/2018-q2-update
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 22:53:00 GMT):<br/>
crypto-lib and z-mix are probably labs we will be able to archive as they both went to Ursa.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 22:53:22 GMT):<br/>
Waiting for Ursa community to ensure we don't archive the repo if they want to move it over.

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 29 Nov 2018 23:58:18 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt I think we are transferring the repos, although I am not sure about the exact process.  @MALodder wants to move the code over so that the history is preserved (which makes DCO, among other things, easier to deal with).  You can read more specifics in our meeting minutes:  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z_8o8k_PFRM4XfZyv9jH1_-IyN0CsCMI2JlrGsCX378/edit?usp=sharing.

This is so one can see the trend. For instance, having 80, 2 would be very different from 80, 40. But it's ok if we don't have that this time around.

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 14:02:07 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt Thanks for that. I was trying to get the Q3 update together (I thought it was Q3 since the last one was Q2); However Tracy has done great work with the Q4 report (should it be Q3 or Q4?). I do think it would be useful to have a list of issues and governance concerns. I do not think we need to go to granular level of PRs.  @lehors @trbs @rjones
</p>

<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 17:20:55 GMT):<br/>
I think that will cover what you are asking for. Specifically, are we still seeing movement for existing labs. We can then just bring this over each time as a "reported last time"
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 18:09:45 GMT):<br/>
@trbs @lehors @VipinB @rjones : I thought it might be good to do a summary of where we are at with our open pull requests so that we can see about moving these forward:
* [Convector](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/pull/48): Approved. Waiting on transfer of repository to hyperledger-labs organization from the owners. @lehors : Can you follow up with @walmon and see where we are at?
* [Private Transaction Families](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/pull/52): The last commit had a DCO issue. @Dan can you follow up with @sgurary on this?
* [Sawtooth Healthcare](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/pull/53): Waiting for review from Lab Stewards.
* [Payments Performance Test Harness](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/pull/60): It appears that we have one +1 and waiting on one more.
* [IBAN Portability](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/pull/42): This seems to have had no response from the original submitter since October 8th. Do we leave open? Do we close? Do we attempt to reach back out?

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 18:12:19 GMT):<br/>
Yep. I'm told there's some other company process that needs to be done before they can push code out so I think that's the sticking point on Priv. Txn. Fams.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/labs?msg=TbQ2hJG28TH3k6mfE) @tkuhrt I actually had a video call with the convector guys. The request to transfer ownership of their repo gave them pause and wanting to know more about what the implications were. They seemed to be reassured and ready to proceed. We'll see.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 20:28:19 GMT):<br/>
Okay. If they are uncomfortable with the transfer, we can go ahead and create the lab and have them manually import their code. I have held off on this in favor of the transfer since this seemed to be what was desired.
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 21:34:37 GMT):<br/>
I'm +1 on `Payments Performance Test Harness` the only thing left on my previous comment is that I don't think we know what the repository name will be called but I'm sure this is not a big issue.
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 21:35:55 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @tkuhrt & @VipinB for putting the reports together :-)
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 22:04:09 GMT):<br/>
Seems like right now, it will have a long name `payments-performance-test-harness`
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 22:04:32 GMT):<br/>
I don't know that this is a problem. We have one other one that has a pretty long name.
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 22:41:07 GMT):<br/>
imo If it's only going to use emerald-benchmark it might as well has that in it's name and be shorter ;-) if they wish to implement emerald as one of the benchmarks a more generic name makes more sense... 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 23:32:14 GMT):<br/>
I did not put any report together @trbs; started on Q3, I followed format of regular WG with issues and challenges- let me take another look at what @tkuhrt has put together. 
Sawtooth Healthcare- I had a comment

</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 23:32:30 GMT):<br/>
IBANP- I followed up but got no response
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 23:32:38 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 23:33:07 GMT):<br/>

I would add to the format: (I can do it if everyone agrees)
Overall Health:
The labs are doing well, we have attracted many new contributions, many of the existing labs see a lot of continued activity. Two contributions have left the labs and have been welcomed as as a single project under incubation in Hyperledger, in the form of Hyperledger Ursa. Contributions to the labs continue to flow in not only from people associated with the larger projects, but also from newer participants. We have had some discussions about formalizing the role of the sponsor and come up with consensus around language to be added to the charter. There is an ongoing debate around the eligibility of LF staff to sponsor projects.  We are also exploring the different metrics around commits and their frequency to surface the community health of the labs in general and individual labs in particular.

@tkuhrt @lehors @rjones @VipinB Idea to add 'latest' commit column to the labs in the report ? (although far from perfect it gives somewhat of a activity / staleness metric)
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Wed, 05 Dec 2018 10:03:47 GMT):<br/>
I updated https://wiki.hyperledger.org/labs/2018-q4-update with @VipinB overall health text and last-commit column. Please take look if we want to keep it like this (or revert it back)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/labs?msg=LEiNX5hYTBiFHHsMt) @VipinB I think that's a good addition, I would however be cautious about claiming that we have consensus on the definition of a sponsor until we have the actual text. Not that I think we disagree, but until we have the actual text it is a bit premature. :-)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 05 Dec 2018 15:59:06 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 05 Dec 2018 16:16:52 GMT):<br/>
Namely : The role of the sponsor is to officially endorse the proposed lab, indicating in doing so that they believe the proposal is worthy of being given a space among the hyperledger labs. Sponsors may also serve as mentors to the project but how much sponsors are involved in the lab beyond its launch is up to them.

</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 05 Dec 2018 16:26:22 GMT):<br/>
Reporting on the health or status of individual labs back to the TSC was NEVER part of labs, I see that that Nathan has proposed that this be the sponsors responsibility (I do not agree to this). Another proposal was that the stewards report on the individual labs (by Hart and Mic). I do not agree to this as well, due to the opacity of the labs and the fact that there are more than 15 labs. We report on the general progress of the labs based on commit statistics and other indications to the TSC. We set labs up to have a low gating factor and we should push to keep it that way.

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 05 Dec 2018 16:45:32 GMT):<br/>
With the current growth spurt of regular WGs, projects under the greenhouse and SIGs- even quarterly reporting to TSC is facing some hurdles. Especially when people cavalierly ignore their scheduled reporting.

Hello labs... I wanted to share project @seanyoung has started that I think has a lot of potential to grow into something rather interesting - we are looking for other maintainers and contributors but I think we would like to propose it to labs before too long. It is a solidity-to-LLVM compiler using modern compiler tooling to generate LLVM IR with an antlr grammar: https://github.com/seanyoung/solang. What we (Burrow) have in mind is using the LLVM WASM backend to create a migration path for existing solidity code and also thinking about WASM-EVM interop within Burrow that can bring with it a host of advantages. In the context of Hyperledger I would like to see WASM emerge as a cross-framework point of integration for different projects (and I know others would too). On top of this it has the advantage of running through sane, mature, modern compiling machinery. 

I would be grateful for any feedback or guidance - particularly from labs stewards
</p>

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 17:22:49 GMT):<br/>
One somewhat noteworthy from the perspective of Hyperledger's licensing practice is that if we license this Apache2 it would provide a compiler for Solidity that was not GPL... though it would not be able to compile to EVM bytecode
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 17:23:11 GMT):<br/>
Also perhaps some interest for EEA?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sun, 06 Jan 2019 18:42:45 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis @seanyoung seems like a worthy endeavor to do a solidity to LLVM compiler. Will look further at your proposal or help you write one following the lab template. Thanks for this. I also speak as a lab steward!

@diestrin : We don't give anyone Admin access to the different lab repositories. I know that @rjones made you a maintainer of the repo. What are you looking to do on the repo that you need Admin access?
</p>
<p><strong>diestrin</strong> (Mon, 11 Feb 2019 23:04:14 GMT):<br/>
hmmm, Arnaud mention we were still going to have admin access to the repo.
We can't get to control settings of the repo, like default branches, or merge strategies, just to give an example.

<p><strong>walmon</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 15:55:15 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt I don't think we can do much without admin access. It's stopping us, for example I can't even assign tickets
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 15:56:11 GMT):<br/>
@walmon what are you trying to do?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 15:57:49 GMT):<br/>
@walmon I see you still need to accept your invite to get write access. I think that is one step to take
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 15:58:56 GMT):<br/>
@walmon if you go here: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs you should be able to accept your invite.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 15:59:11 GMT):<br/>
right now @diestrin is the only person that accepted an invite
</p>
<p><strong>walmon</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 16:08:53 GMT):<br/>
My bad then. Thanks! So it's more about what @diestrin was telling in previous messages. He's flying today though so maybe it's better to wait until he can chat again to explain further 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 16:14:34 GMT):<br/>
@walmon I see you now have write access to the repo. Are you able to assign issues, etc?
</p>
<p><strong>walmon</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 17:06:06 GMT):<br/>
Yes, all fine for me for now! Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>diestrin</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 16:17:39 GMT):<br/>
Hey @rjones, so with write access only we cannot for example control things like default branch, add or remove our own collaborators, define any branch strategy, set up any web hooks, integrations or even see any security vulnerability alerts
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 21:21:34 GMT):<br/>
@diestrin I'll break this down
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 21:22:37 GMT):<br/>
default branch: file helpdesk ticket or ask me.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 21:24:20 GMT):<br/>
add or remove collaborators: this is a subtle thing. You can add existing members of the Hyperledger-labs org to your team or teams, and you can freely create subteams under the team I created for you. What you can't do is invite people to join the Hyperledger-labs org, because github requires org ownership to invite members. Feel free to manage your own team or teams as you like. Please send a helpdesk ticket to get someone invited to the hyperledger-labs org.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 21:24:54 GMT):<br/>
web hooks, integrations: helpdesk@hyperledger.org
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 21:25:31 GMT):<br/>
security reports: this is an oversight on my part and I will fix that _tout de suite_

Hi guys, I've been trying to find some one to help us on this, so I'm just going to share my question here:
What's the expected process/path/roadmap for a project to graduate? Requirements or guidance will be very much appreciated, we'd like to focus our efforts and the communities' into this
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 00:33:02 GMT):<br/>
@walmon graduate to what? a 1.0 in the labs or to a fully fledged project outside labs? For being a project in Hyperledger; you have to write up a project proposal doc which follows the template and get it through the tsc voting.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 00:35:51 GMT):<br/>
https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Proposal+Template+for+a+Hyperledger+Project
</p>
<p><strong>walmon</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 03:37:34 GMT):<br/>
To fully fledged, we were told that one of the main reason projects get to labs is to eventually graduate, and that there are some requirements to be met before (documentation, examples, community, etc). My question is more about what to do before submitting the proposal to have a more aligned proposal.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 03:58:33 GMT):<br/>
@walmon main TSC questions would be. What does this project proposal bring to the table that is unique? Usually they approve only proposals that are not client facing (i.e. applications). Other question will be about governance, diversity of contributors (are they from different companies? can the project survive if a group of people (from the same company) left?

@tkuhrt Do you have any idea why I can't import com.luxoft.blockchainlab.corda.hyperledger.indy.flow.AssignPermissionsFlow in cordentity? I'm getting an unresolved reference for corda in that import statement
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 05 Mar 2019 13:46:12 GMT):<br/>
@noah4477 : no idea. Is the error occurring when you do the build?
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 05 Mar 2019 13:47:15 GMT):<br/>
@dpitt3 : Just had. Look at your updates. Can you confirm sponsor on the byzantine-browser lab?
</p>
<p><strong>noah4477</strong> (Tue, 05 Mar 2019 15:06:13 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt it sees that it potentially may be fixed in the hyperledger-labs version, but that isn't able to build because everything was migrated to sovrin

</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 11 Mar 2019 19:30:17 GMT):<br/>
@dpitt3 : It might be worth separating them into two distinct PRs then so that we can move the byzantine-config forward. Unless of course you want them to both come in together.

Hi @rjones, thanks for approving and providing the `nephos` repo. I've migrated the repo, but now want to set up several CI/QA tools that I had in the original repo, namely `Travis CI`, `Snyk`, `SonarQube` and `CodeCov`, as well as setting up protection for the master branch so that I can ensure nobody commits directly to it but can only do PRs

How should I do this, as I don't have permissions to do this (e.g. via the GitHub marketplace, and via the settings on the repo itself)?

Thanks!
Sasha

Hi @tkuhrt @rjones , 
we already have some people from other companies interested in contributing to Nephos (which is currently included in Hyperledger Labs) but we don't have a place where to share thoughts yet. 

We are considering to make a public slack channel in our organisation, but probably one in Rocketchat would be the best option. In that way other people from Hyperledger can easily contribute to the project. 
Would it be possible to have a #Nephos channel for this?

Thank you 
Nicola

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sat, 16 Mar 2019 16:31:54 GMT):<br/>
So @rjones  is the question around individual communication channels for labs; whether they should use the public labs channel or other channels?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sat, 16 Mar 2019 16:35:29 GMT):<br/>
I know we probably cannot have individual rocketchat channels for each lab. What I have seen is that people have established channels that they are comfortable with like slack, reddit etc. They could also use the labs channel and mark it so that it is searchable. Iroha bas a telegram channel which they use a bot with to have bridges between RocketChat and Telegram

```Hello everyone, I am going through paper of HL Fabric and trying to understand. I have few questions though, we know that we are planning to implement BFT, my question is, since HL fabric uses _passive replication_ how it is possible to implement BFT? My 2nd question is why do we need to implement BFT since we already know identities of actors (if they do wrong they can be caught right?)``` Pardon if my question does not makes any sense, I am still very new to distributed computing and blockchain stuffs.

already sent a note about this to the hyperledger helpdesk... but question about project naming... we would like to change the name of the labs project currently called "fabric secure chaincode" to "fabric private chaincode". Would it be easier to rename the repository or to just create a new one?

@MicBowman Perhaps a PR to update the repo name should happen, in the original proposal. That's one way the decision could be made in an open way, votes could be recorded, etc.

Renaming has another benefit which is not obvious - the forks and stars and followers will still exist.

@rjones created a new branch but getting another dco status check when trying to push local commits to remote branch .   commits in the branch have DCO signoff.   Repo is byzantine-config  wondering if you could advise? Thanks, David

@rjones, another question, trying to push to a branch on byzantine-config, commits have DCO sigs.. getting a protected branch and DCO error? 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 17:11:41 GMT):<br/>
@dpitt3 don't push directly to a branch. fork to your repo, make changes, then make a PR
</p>

@rjones quick question; in fabric-private-chaincodes, for some reason we start collecting stale branches (most probably introduced by some github merging magic) and nobody has permission to delete those branches
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>bur</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 19:26:02 GMT):<br/>

Dear Admin of GitHub hyperledger-labs organization, I am a member of MinBFT lab and would like to ask you to install CircleCI GitHub app for our lab. Our lab have been using the app for CI, but sometimes CI is not triggered. I advised to re-install the app for troubleshooting (I have removed the current installation).

<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 15:44:46 GMT):<br/>
@rjones @VipinB @lehors @trbs : question regarding recent PR -- sponsor definition = maintainer of Hyperledger project, TSC member or WG chair. PR lists SIG chair as sponsor. This doesn't meet the criteria. Difference between SIG and WG is the expectation of product output from WG. Thoughts on sponsorship change and presenting that to TSC. I am torn. 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 15:53:25 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt I assume you are referring to https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/pull/84/files If it helps I can step in as a sponsor as I was involved in the start of the project. However, we have to also look at the spirit and not the letter of the law. May help to clarify with tsc. However, the main idea for labs is to be lightweight and be backed by a community leader. SIGs did not exist at the time when we made this rule. 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 15:54:45 GMT):<br/>
Telecommsig seems to be more technical than most others. I suspect this will be the same case with #capital-markets-sig 
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 14:00:51 GMT):<br/>
We moved the SIGs out of the TSC because they tended to be discussion forums for business people. The intent of the Maintainer/TSC/WG connection for labs submissions is that the labs have some connection to the ongoing work. I'd ask that we require sponsors as indicated.

@VipinB -- thanks for stepping in as sponsor for the TCSIG labs proposal.  separate from the issue of if a SIG Chair can be a sponsor or not, i'm glad you can step in here to move things forward.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 21:28:27 GMT):<br/>
I was involved in the initial stages of the ICS write up and project. 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Mon, 22 Jul 2019 21:31:17 GMT):<br/>
It is a classic use case for collaboration between enterprises and seems to have clear benefits. Telecom SIG participants who work on this are clearly subject matter experts, and it is more technical than most SIGs

@rjones  in Telecom SIG right now we have two subgroups one is ICS and other is SLA and we want to upload code for SLA as well. Now we have two options either we could have one repo for telco sig in which we will make sub repos for each use case or other option is we can request for new repo in Hyperledger lab for each use case. Please let me know which one is suitable according to lab rules?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 18:36:16 GMT):<br/>
I'd create a new lab, honestly
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 21:13:08 GMT):<br/>
I don't think it's so much a matter of what the "rules" are as what makes most sense in terms of how labs are reorganized so that people can easily find the different pieces of code that exist and how they could evolve in the future

</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 21:14:42 GMT):<br/>
it seems to me that having everything under a single lab makes it harder for people to find the different sub repos
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 21:15:41 GMT):<br/>
and if one of them at some point were to graduate to a project I think it's cleaner to have them managed as individual repos
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 21:16:44 GMT):<br/>
you could group them by using a common prefix for their name if you'd like, this would give some grouping and yet keep the visibility and independence for each "sub-repo"
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 22:14:47 GMT):<br/>
please, I beg you, don't actually use `git` sub repos. thank you for your forbearance

@rjones to overcome DCO issue I followed this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI6c-svQxBY&t=369s  1) Roll back to previous valid commit by: git reset <commit_id> and 2) git push force

@rjones in the case of the labs for inter carrier settlements there are only two committers, @viprat is having difficulty getting his fellow committer to review in time. I propose that in cases where there are only two committers the PR should only require one approval, especially in labs.

Hi. Can I ask you to create a repository for [the Fabric block archiving project](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/blob/master/labs/fabric-block-archiving.md)? We have already had [the existing repository](https://github.com/nekia/fabric-block-archiving), but we'd like to continue development on a repository under the Hyperledger Labs. @rjones

@labstewards should we add to the instructions a bullet asking the submitter of a lab to make sure the sponsor comments on the PR with his/her approval ? Now we have to ask the sponsor either offline or in a comment to confirm sponsorship. 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 17:33:42 GMT):<br/>
@trbs this assumes that sponsor's have github ids. That may not be the case always.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 17:34:08 GMT):<br/>
However, this might be a good thing to do in 95% of the cases
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 17:34:08 GMT):<br/>
They will have a github id in 90+% of cases
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 18 Oct 2019 17:35:57 GMT):<br/>
So I am for adding this to the bullet with the caveat that we will do off channel confirmation with sponsor

What's the npm package scope we must use for labs projects? @hyperledger/your-package-name or @hyperledger-labs/your-package-name?
Would prefer the first option to avoid putting a migration burden on all early adopters in the event of the project graduating, but also understand if there has to be a strict distinction. Please advise. :-)

This is the labs project to be specific: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-integration-framework

</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 18:20:01 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @rjones ! Are you aware of a wiki perhaps that I could comb through for governing principles around this? I remember that there was one specifically for naming of the projects, but I lost the link. :/
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 19:42:21 GMT):<br/>
@trbs @tkuhrt @lehors @VipinB thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 20:29:19 GMT):<br/>
The npm package names have not yet come up IIRC. The naming of the projects says that the proposal file should have the same name as the repo (We will also check non-collision with project names). Labs have been setup as a separate organization in github. 
No problems either way about the npm naming- the labs names do not and will not collide with project names. But prefixing with @hyperledger instead of @hyperledger-labs may give the wrong impression. Therefore my choice is to use @hyperledger-labs. 
Please also estimate effort for the npm package name change in case of migration to project status; is this not just a change in the package.json file that is part of the release? Also if migrating there should be release notes that will tell users to do a npm install for changing dependencies in package.json.  If this is a really heavy lift for early adaptors I can be persuaded to change my mind.
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 21:34:06 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB Thank you for weighing in! The developer effort should be pretty minimal indeed, what may give extra headache to certain users is their own processes (new package name means new approval from legal, etc). 
It shouldn't be a huge effort anyhow and we could make it work with aliases to soften the punch. E.g. in the event of the project graduating we could publish the same package with both scopes, but until the graduation we can just stay on the @hyperledger-labs scope. Making the assumption that this would be fine based on the project names being unique anyway.
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 21:40:48 GMT):<br/>
Moving on to my next question: Can we use MPL-2.0 licensed OSS components as part of our lab which is Apache 2.0? Specifically looking to use the distributed lock feature of Consul, but could switch to Apache Zookeeper if  there is some issue with MPL-2.0.
Consul repo: https://github.com/hashicorp/consul
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 11:26:28 GMT):<br/>
@peter_somogyvari I think as long as the dependencies are also Apache 2.0 there should be no problem. I do not know what happens if the dependencies are open source but with a different kind of license. Also what happens with a graph of dependencies. This must be the case in any significant project, since the web of dependencies can spread pretty wide. Useful would be to know what would MPL-2.0 OSS depend on.  Maybe any of our esteemed colleagues can jump in here with their take on this. @trbs @tkuhrt @lehors 
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 17:38:58 GMT):<br/>
For dependencies that are linked in, create a NOTICES file that lists the dependencies and their license. Someone may choose not to use code if they don’t like dependency’s license. If they are dependencies that you are including in the source base, go with Apache 2.0 licenses @peter_somogyvari 
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 17:39:56 GMT):<br/>
See the NOTICES file in https://GitHub.com/Hyperledger/sawtooth-core for an example
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 18:46:50 GMT):<br/>
Thank you @tkuhrt ! Will go with Apache then.

Hi, Now We’re working on [fabric-block-archiving]((https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-block-archiving) projects under Hyperledger Labs. Currently, our main efforts are put on improvement of reliability. If we can get some feedback on our project from Hyperledger Labs and Hyperledger Fabric community members at the implementation level, that’ll be quite useful for the improvement of UX, I think. Are there any recommended ways to achieve that?

@nekia : I would engage with the Fabric community on their chat channels. You can also post to the Fabric mailing list. Another option might be talking with the Hyperledger Fabric contributes on their next scheduled call, which looks like it is November 13th (https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=MjM0bGFlYTUyMHR0N3RkZTA1bnNsMG9kMHBfMjAxOTExMTNUMTQwMDAwWiBsaW51eGZvdW5kYXRpb24ub3JnX25mOXU2NGc5azlydmQ5Zjh2cDR2dXIyM2IwQGc&ctz=Etc/GMT)

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 16:49:26 GMT):<br/>
I don't know what you mean. What are you expecting, and where do you expect it?
</p>
<p><strong>jordy24</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 16:52:05 GMT):<br/>
so basically I would like to be able to contribute on the fabric-private-chaincode 
</p>
<p><strong>jordy24</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 16:53:33 GMT):<br/>
@rjones could you add me on this https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger-labs/teams/hyperledger-contributors/members
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 16:54:50 GMT):<br/>
You need to accept the invite.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 16:54:59 GMT):<br/>
you should have gotten an email
</p>
<p><strong>jordy24</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 16:55:21 GMT):<br/>
oh okay let me check
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 16:56:07 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman or @swetha will need to add you here to have merge ability: https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger-labs/teams/fabric-private-chaincode-committers/members but you need none of this to, for example, file pull requests and the like
</p>
<p><strong>jordy24</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 17:01:21 GMT):<br/>
@rjones thanks, I had not seen the email... but now that works... 
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 17:15:33 GMT):<br/>
@jordy24 i believe i just approved you
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 17:18:27 GMT):<br/>
@rjones i think @tkuhrt is the only maintainer on the private data objects repo. could you make/add me as maintainer?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 17:49:24 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 09:14:13 GMT):<br/>
I've accidentally accepted a PR with pseudonyms in the commit Signed-off-by (DCO). I have contacted the author and he has said it is okay to rebase with his real name. See: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang/commit/1ae07d5d69c8e789e009a926062d35c40d076226 However,  I do not have rights to force-push to master and neither am I convinced that it's a great idea. What's the best way to proceed here?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 14:01:48 GMT):<br/>
@seanyoung I would have them sign an empty commit from the correct address. `git commit -s --allow-empty` with a message something like "I am $name, signing commit 1ae... for myself"
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 17:14:19 GMT):<br/>
@rjones good idea. Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 17:19:51 GMT):<br/>
@seanyoung I'm not sure exactly how to prove anything, but it would work. Easier than `git push -f`
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Sun, 26 Jan 2020 12:50:44 GMT):<br/>

I would like feedback on this page: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/labs/Driving+growth+of+Hyperledger+Labs from anyone, but in particular stewards. I'd like to have a meeting after the TSC call on 06 FEB: https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/labs/viewevent?eventid=703905&calstart=2020-02-06
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Mon, 27 Jan 2020 20:47:31 GMT):<br/>
@rjones i'm very interested in participating in the call but i'm not available on the 6th. is that date fixed?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 27 Jan 2020 20:49:36 GMT):<br/>
It is not. I was looking to attach onto the tail of a TSC call, but I'm not married to it. I also wanted to give time for the topic to develop in the wiki.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 27 Jan 2020 20:50:24 GMT):<br/>
would the week after be OK? I don't want to delay too long, but I also don't want to do it this week :)
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Mon, 27 Jan 2020 20:50:31 GMT):<br/>
in general that time is fine... just in this case i'm traveling on the 6th. so... know that i'm interested & will gladly participate if we can find a day
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Mon, 27 Jan 2020 20:50:38 GMT):<br/>
yes... 13th would be fine
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 27 Jan 2020 20:51:42 GMT):<br/>
I'll wait a little bit for feedback from @tkuhrt @VipinB @trbs and @lehors and change it later today
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 27 Jan 2020 21:25:49 GMT):<br/>
Added some thoughts on the page. Can you provide more context on what is driving this discussion, @rjones ? 
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Mon, 27 Jan 2020 22:27:01 GMT):<br/>
The Linux Foundation’s CommunityBridge engineers are working on a tool to measure the health of critical open source projects and one of the key areas identified is QA Testing.  They request that our communities provide  honest and detailed information on testing tools and methodologies you use in your projects for us to come up with a detailed analysis, which they will share with all respondents and projects. https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/9H5G2GV. It’s only 5 questions long.

@rjones anything specific for the meeting. I have made some comments on the page.

Looking to push `BIF` packages to npm. Does anyone know how can I get access to the @hyperledger-labs package scope/npm org? My npm username is `peter.somogyvari`
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 21:39:28 GMT):<br/>
@peter_somogyvari please send email to community-architects@hyperledger.org I’ll handle it
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 21:41:26 GMT):<br/>
Invite sent
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 22:13:47 GMT):<br/>
Thank you @rjones accepted the invitation and now I (assume) I can publish publish packages under the @hyperledger org, but earlier we discussed that for labs projects it would be better if they published under @hyperledger-labs which I think means that there has to be another npm org with that name (not aware of npm having a feature where you can have multiple scopes under one org but if it exists then never mind everything I just said).
Are you aware of another org on npm for labs?
Also, if the situation have changed since we last talked about (on this channel, a few months back) and now it's okay for labs to publish on the main @hyperledger scope, then I am happy to do just that, just let me know.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 22:20:07 GMT):<br/>
Give me a bit to work this out
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 23:03:06 GMT):<br/>
Got the invite, cheers
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 23:03:38 GMT):<br/>
sure thing. I think you're good to go at this point?
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 23:04:38 GMT):<br/>
I should be as far as I know. Will try to publish a package with the labs scope and report back if there's any issues (don't foresee having any)
Thank you very much once again!

<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 22:12:00 GMT):<br/>
Hi, @seanyoung. There should not be anything specific that you would need to do to the repository. You may have heard in the TSC call today the discussion around the [repository structure task force recommendations](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/TF/Repository+Structure+Task+Force) being a soft requirements for labs. Looking at the [contributors](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang/graphs/contributors), I would imagine that one of the questions that will come up is surrounding diversity. As always, there will be conversations about how you would foresee this working with the other projects within Hyperledger. 
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 07 Feb 2020 10:13:00 GMT):<br/>

I've started looking at repo structure, I'll make some more changes around that.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 07 Feb 2020 15:47:58 GMT):<br/>
I took a stab at your "good first bug" and, all I can say is - coming from C, rust is an experience :)
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 07 Feb 2020 15:52:00 GMT):<br/>
It really is very different! I'm also very much a C-type person. It took quite some time to get used to rust.

@rjones Can you override `master` branch with `development-v2.0` branch. We rebased our codebase to fabric v2.0.1. We'd like to do our further development on this branch. https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-block-archiving 
</p>

Hello, I’m a committer for a recently approved project, “Blockchain Verifier”. Can we get a GitHub repo under hyperledger-labs?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 22:12:09 GMT):<br/>
@shimos please transfer the repo to me on GitHub - `ryjones`
</p>
<p><strong>shimos</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 22:18:54 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. I have requested transfer of "bcverifier"
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 11 Mar 2020 22:22:34 GMT):<br/>
OK. I think it's set up now
</p>

Thank you!

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 15:46:41 GMT):<br/>
Similar question, I have a lab approved with an existing repo. Shall I just transfer that to `ryjones`or to `hyperledger-labs`?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 16:29:19 GMT):<br/>
to me.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 16:29:36 GMT):<br/>
does it need renamed? if so, please rename it before you send it
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 16:31:58 GMT):<br/>
you can transfer it to any org owner, but in practice, that's me.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 17:35:21 GMT):<br/>
no rename required. it has a dumb name. I have decided that dumb names save me 400 hours of work on average. :D
Look for a transfer request shortly. You will know it by the dumbness of the name.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 17:36:48 GMT):<br/>
OK. @tkuhrt could I ask you to merge https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/pull/120 ?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 17:36:57 GMT):<br/>
(or @VipinB if he's around)
</p>

@Dan I didn't know you were an ANCAP?

Hi - [this pluggable consensus lab](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/blob/master/labs/pluggable-hcs.md) was approved, but the code was never moved over. Any insights as to what is going on there?

@rjones Sorry to bother! Could you take a look if there's a one-time setup step you could click through as an admin for BAF (blockchain-automation-framework) on CircleCI for the labs? 
I mean what they describe here:
https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/getting-started/#setting-up-circleci

Tried to do it myself but it's greyed out and says 'contact repo admin' by which they mean a github org owner according to their docs so I'm hoping that you won't have it greyed out.

https://app.circleci.com/projects/project-dashboard/github/hyperledger-labs
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 22 Apr 2020 14:00:10 GMT):<br/>
@peter_somogyvari could I screen share with you?
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Wed, 22 Apr 2020 14:05:56 GMT):<br/>
Yeah sure

@lehors WRT the language lab: would it make more sense for projects like that to be in the main Fabric repo?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 14:20:37 GMT):<br/>
I sure think so
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 14:21:22 GMT):<br/>
from what I remember the chinese went into a lab because of a reluctance from the fabric maintainers to take ownership of something they didn't understand
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 14:21:38 GMT):<br/>
I always felt it was a bit of a lame position to take
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 14:22:02 GMT):<br/>
so, I suppose we could ask for this to be revisited
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 14:27:14 GMT):<br/>
for that matter it would bring a set of new maintainers and increase diversity in the project which would certainly be a good thing
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 14 May 2020 16:00:28 GMT):<br/>
Yes. I'd propose rolling the Malay request in a request for more /docs/ maintainers, and closing the Chinese lab with the same motion
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 18 May 2020 19:50:04 GMT):<br/>
I will file a motion to the Fabric maintainers! :-)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 18 May 2020 19:50:04 GMT):<br/>
I will file a motion with the Fabric maintainers! :-)

It is Malayalam (the longest single word palindrome in the OED). My mother tongue @rjones - I see @lehors already did this.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 26 May 2020 15:23:03 GMT):<br/>
Meaning filing a motion with the Fabric Maintainers. I cant wait to see what the Malayalam translation of fabric docs are going to look like.

If @tkuhrt is busy I can second the PR as well, no need to give @tkuhrt extra work, I just don't want to force approval after you guys did all the review work :-)

@rjones @sbalikondwar is working on a vscode extension for Solidity using Solang. The work has only just started but it is going well. Ideally this would be hosted as a separate repo. How do we got about request a labs repo for this? We were thinking solang-vscode but open to suggestions. WIP is here  https://github.com/Hyperion101010/sls/tree/p1_work

<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 19:36:26 GMT):<br/>
@lehors @tkuhrt @VipinB @rjones @stewards do we have a list of all eligible sponsors ? I'm reviewing https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/pull/132 which LGTM but trying to figure out if RafaelAPB is a valid sponsor...  (i.e. a maintainer of one of the Hyperledger projects, a TSC member or a WG chair)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 19:48:38 GMT):<br/>
sadly we don't and short of being able to automatically generate such a list it would be a real pain to do that by hand
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 19:49:34 GMT):<br/>
this is something we actually talked about on a recent TSC call and it was suggested to put a page where people who qualify could volunteer to have their name on it to help lab submitters find a suitable sponsor
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 19:49:43 GMT):<br/>
unfortunately I don't think there were many takers
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 19:50:01 GMT):<br/>
@rjones would be able to say what the status is on that attempt
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 20:21:28 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, I will try again and see if i missed something on github or the hyperledger site tomorrow to verify if RafaelAPB qualifies as a sponsor..
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 01:06:43 GMT):<br/>
@lehors I made such a list, but I was told to delete it and ask for sponsors.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 02:26:17 GMT):<br/>
@rjones but did anyone add themselves to the list?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 02:27:04 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/sponsors no
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 02:27:12 GMT):<br/>
@trbs rather than going on a goose chase I would suggest you simply ask the submitter how
</p>

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 02:27:53 GMT):<br/>
@rjones ok that's what I thought, thanks

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 02:28:21 GMT):<br/>
@lehors this gets to a prickly issue about labs.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 02:29:00 GMT):<br/>
actually, it touches on a lot of things.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 02:29:10 GMT):<br/>
I agree
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 02:29:47 GMT):<br/>
I spent a lot of time trying to hunt down evidence that several of the mentorships marked successful actually were, and I don't think they were.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 02:29:54 GMT):<br/>
one simple thing we could do is change the template to ask for the sponsor's "qualifications"
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 02:30:12 GMT):<br/>
or make being a mentor one of those roles?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 02:30:34 GMT):<br/>
we also have TWGC which has split off into a new org, over my objections
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 02:30:58 GMT):<br/>
so instead of saying just "Joe Dalton" they would have to say "Joe Dalton, chair of the Brothers WG"
</p>

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 02:31:30 GMT):<br/>
 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 08:06:32 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-labs.github.io/blob/master/proposal-template.md#sponsor in the proposal template the definition of sponsor and requirement to specify how he/she/it (what is the correct pronoun ?) qualitifies it's already pretty clearly stated imho by asking for the role within hyperledger :-)
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 08:07:19 GMT):<br/>
guess that also answer my own question :grin: since "mentor" is not one of the valid qualifications.... (unless we change it to make it so... but guess that's an agenda topic for TSC meeting ?)
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 08:09:10 GMT):<br/>
I will make a PR to update the pull_request_template.md to be clearer about the sponsor requirements and for the submitter to make sure the sponsor also takes part of the PR so we don't have to case the sponsors every time for confirmation of sponsorship. (Which Rafael nicely did I shall add :-) )
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 09:22:51 GMT):<br/>
@trbs given that the template already calls for the role to be specified, we simply need to enforce its specification in the proposals
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 09:23:26 GMT):<br/>
if a proposal comes in with just a name we should make a request they specify the "sponsor qualifying role"
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 09:24:32 GMT):<br/>
@lehors right
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 09:24:54 GMT):<br/>
The PR is intended to make it a little bit easier and faster for everybody by having the proposers ask the sponsor to confirm their sponsorship after they submit the PR.
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 09:25:32 GMT):<br/>
(but also happy to close it, we if think it's not that helpful :-) )
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 09:27:43 GMT):<br/>
just looked at your PR
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 09:27:53 GMT):<br/>
I think we need to be more direct
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 09:28:20 GMT):<br/>
everytime we give people some leeway they end up tripping on it :)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 09:29:34 GMT):<br/>
as you update your PR, please, also add something about the need to specify the "role of the sponsor which makes the person qualify as a sponsor"
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 09:29:48 GMT):<br/>
agreed, I was not sure if requiring a github account would be an easy for sponsors since HL mostly uses the linuxfoundation accounts ?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 09:29:56 GMT):<br/>
there is probably a more elegant way to say that though :)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 09:31:06 GMT):<br/>
I don't think having a github id is too much to expect from the sponsors
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 09:31:23 GMT):<br/>
I bet all qualifying people have one
</p>
<p><strong>trbs</strong> (Thu, 02 Jul 2020 09:31:37 GMT):<br/>
true :-)

Hi, for several reasons, I moved Labs under Hyperledger in stats. This makes getting stats for the overall project easier. https://lfanalytics.io/projects/hyperledger%2Fhyperledger-labs/dashboard

<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 03 Sep 2020 16:40:30 GMT):<br/>
question... we are starting a project to build a fairly substantial application for the fabric private chaincode lab (which will also use code from the private data objects lab), we want this to be very closely related to FPC but the group of committers would be different from the FPC core committers... would this be better handled as a branch of FPC or as a new HL Labs project?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Sep 2020 16:41:00 GMT):<br/>
other projects seem to have multiple repos
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 03 Sep 2020 16:41:25 GMT):<br/>
could we then request a second repo for FPC that we could use for that code?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Sep 2020 16:41:44 GMT):<br/>
what do you want it named?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Sep 2020 16:42:06 GMT):<br/>
is it a copy of the existing repo? who are the initial maintainers?
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 03 Sep 2020 16:43:15 GMT):<br/>
fabric_private_chaincode_wasm  and we can start with an empty repo, we'll just use git modules to connect to FPC
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 03 Sep 2020 16:43:46 GMT):<br/>
for now... if you can copy the maintainers list from FPC and i'll get you the changes
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 03 Sep 2020 16:44:04 GMT):<br/>
oh... and please use "-" instead of "_"... apparently i'm old school

<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 03 Sep 2020 16:55:30 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman just out of interest,what's the plan with with fpc-wasm? I'm asking, since Solang now supports almost all of Solidity (a few remaining items happening this month), is this something Solang can target?
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 03 Sep 2020 16:59:30 GMT):<br/>
we should definitely talk! we've added support for WASM contracts in the private data objects project (meaning that we can build and execute contracts inside an SGX enclave using WASM), this new repository will be a port of the interpreter to FPC, initially it will run as a chaincode application with an expectation that we'll make the integration with FPC more "natural" if appropriate at a future time
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 03 Sep 2020 16:59:55 GMT):<br/>
so... in theory, if we can support any native extensions you have, we should be able to run "now" in PDO and shortly in FPC
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 04 Sep 2020 08:56:28 GMT):<br/>
So I'm very busy finishing language support in Solang, I don't have much time right now. But once that is done let's talk
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Fri, 04 Sep 2020 16:11:22 GMT):<br/>

@tkuhrt, now that the perun repos are up and running, we'd like to transition to more of an open mode of working. Two questions regarding infrastructure:
(1) Would it be possible to setup a #perun channel in the Hyperledger Chat server so we can move development related conversations currently occurring on a closed system to a publicly accessible one?
(2) Can we setup a GitHub project in the Hyperledger Labs Org that is connected with perun-node, perun-doc, and perun-proposals repos (like in the old org here: https://github.com/orgs/direct-state-transfer/projects/1) to help with planning and getting an overview on current development activity? Or is there some other system you typically use for Hyperledger projects?
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Wed, 09 Sep 2020 13:48:35 GMT):<br/>
@rjones : It looks like I can no longer create chat channels here. Can you help?

Also, do we support projects in Github?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 09 Sep 2020 14:12:59 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt projects are A-OK.

Ah, okay. Great!
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 09 Sep 2020 14:24:02 GMT):<br/>
however, I see that the labs prefix isn't consistently used. If you want it removed, I will do that.
</p>
<p><strong>choeppler</strong> (Wed, 09 Sep 2020 14:26:59 GMT):<br/>
In that case, I think perun would be nicer... :-)

:thumbsup: nice stats.
I just browsed a bit around the dashboard. Is the mapping from committer's github account to Name and Organization done automatically? I've noticed some commits show up under the github account name, most under real name, same for organization (sometimes actual org, sometimes "Unknown")...

Would it be helpful if I sent you some of the missing mappings I've come across (mainly regarding colleagues from my org) or do you have that on the stack to by typed in, anyway... ;-)

What's the preferred way to add an additional collaborator to a labs project on GitHub? Post name and required permission level here in the chat or open a ticket in the project and assign that to the labs steward who set up the project, or something else...?

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 02 Oct 2020 21:24:08 GMT):<br/>
@rjones @lehors @tkuhrt @trbs  I have raised a query about the wisdom of archiving after 6 months of non-activity
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 02 Oct 2020 21:51:16 GMT):<br/>
Have these labs achieved anything or were they just proposals that never really took off?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 02 Oct 2020 22:00:59 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB you're worried that people who started a lab, and let it lie fallow for six months, might not get picked up for the election because they've made no other contributions anywhere?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 02 Oct 2020 22:02:01 GMT):<br/>
regardless, archiving labs still keeps GitHub's magic redirects in place; also, these labs either have or have not contributed unique voters for the ongoing election, but that franchise won't be revoked.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 02 Oct 2020 22:02:29 GMT):<br/>
I think a larger issue is this weeding of fallow labs is a task that's on the lab stewards, but I'm the person doing it.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 02 Oct 2020 22:03:38 GMT):<br/>
When I asked that the lab activity reports come from the labs, I got pushback. I was reminded today that I haven't done one for 2020, which is why I looked into this at all.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sat, 03 Oct 2020 14:50:53 GMT):<br/>
@rjones it is not up to us to decide whether a one year contribution counts; it is in the charter. Does your statement mean that the redirects will allow for these labs to be picked back up when looking at electors? 
What exactly does this "weeding" achieve?  I am curious. As far I know this was put into place by you. As far as the job of weeding falling to lab stewards, I have no problem with that, but all stewards need to agree.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sat, 03 Oct 2020 14:53:24 GMT):<br/>
Last time there was a "weeding", some parties asked for re-instatement
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 05 Oct 2020 04:25:28 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB the weeding is literally a part of the description of what lab stewards are supposed to do. ```Archiving
Stewards are responsible for curating the set of labs, moving to an archives space (see below) those that become dormant or unresponsive for an extended period (6+ months), or are explicitly deemed by the committers to be deprecated/obsoleted.

Deprecated, obsoleted, or dormant labs (as defined above) will be moved to a GitHub org “hyperledger-labs-archives” that signifies that the lab is no longer maintained. Labs in the archives are read-only, and they can be moved back out of the archives, if there is interest in reviving them.```

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Mon, 05 Oct 2020 11:05:45 GMT):<br/>
we wrote that a couple of years ago but the period can be changed in light of its effects on electors, this weeding idea was not in the initial conception. I agree that labs stewards should do it periodically. @rjones
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 05 Oct 2020 14:42:18 GMT):<br/>
I'm fine with the lab stewards changing how labs are run. I defer to @tkuhrt , who was in Portugal, for history

<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 05 Oct 2020 16:26:35 GMT):<br/>
We may need a better process in ensuring that the lab proposers know that we are considering archiving the labs. Possible process could be:
1. Separate PR for each lab archival

</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 07 Oct 2020 11:20:38 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt my main concern is the disconnect between the tsc charter which says contributors are valid electors if they contributed in the last year and the lab archive policy which covers 6 months. In my opinion this should be a yearly activity with the labs getting archived right after the electors are chosen, once a year. In that sense it makes sense to extend to 1 year of inactivity.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 07 Oct 2020 14:09:41 GMT):<br/>
You ignore that the archives are part of the gathering process, as I said above.

Github/Travis has transitioned to a credit-based (or plan-based) CI service, and apparently Hyperledger Labs just ran out of credits.
From Travis website (this should be related to the HL Labs organization): "Builds have been temporarily disabled for private and public repositories due to a negative credit balance. Please go to the Plan page to replenish your credit balance."

Is there any intention to support Travis CI for HL Labs?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 01:13:38 GMT):<br/>
@BrunoVavala no, there is not. Labs are running on the 10,000 credit OSS plan, which is gratis.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 01:16:51 GMT):<br/>
It looks like Blockchain Automation Framework burned all 10,000 credits in under a day - impressive.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 01:18:45 GMT):<br/>
@BrunoVavala I suggest switching to Azure Pipelines or GitHub Actions for CI.

I've enabled discussions, but for funding, I need to check internally (LF)
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 11 Dec 2020 18:11:21 GMT):<br/>
@rjones thanks for enabling discussions! For the funding, I think this would be very helpful. It would be useful for users to know that the project can use funding (not an immediate problem)

@rjones is it possible to rename the master branch to main in my labs repo? I don't have access to this, I think.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 24 Jan 2021 16:03:30 GMT):<br/>
@seanyoung which repos?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 24 Jan 2021 16:03:30 GMT):<br/>
@seanyoung I renamed `solang`
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 24 Jan 2021 18:15:34 GMT):<br/>

Steps for this seem to be: # Step 1 
# create main branch locally, taking the history from master
git branch -m master main
# Step 2 
# push the new local main branch to the remote repo (GitHub) 
git push -u origin main
# Step 3
# switch the current HEAD to the main branch
git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD refs/remotes/origin/main
# Step 4
# change the default branch on GitHub to main
# https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/setting-the-default-branch
# Step 5
# delete the master branch on the remote
git push origin --delete master
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sun, 24 Jan 2021 18:42:20 GMT):<br/>
I will start the process for eThaler and xcsi
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 24 Jan 2021 20:20:17 GMT):<br/>
I think you can just do it in the UI
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 24 Jan 2021 20:20:24 GMT):<br/>
rename the branch and it Just Works
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 24 Jan 2021 20:21:23 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB I think you can go here: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/eThaler/settings/branches and just set the branch name.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 24 Jan 2021 20:22:10 GMT):<br/>
Same thing here: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/xcsi/settings/branches
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 24 Jan 2021 20:22:51 GMT):<br/>
You should have the permissions to delete these other two branches, if you like. https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/xcsi/branches
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sun, 24 Jan 2021 20:26:28 GMT):<br/>
I deleted the branches
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sun, 24 Jan 2021 20:26:56 GMT):<br/>
Rename the master branch to main?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 24 Jan 2021 20:28:09 GMT):<br/>
yes, you can click the pencil by master and type in main
</p>

Since you are admin
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 24 Jan 2021 20:35:14 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sun, 24 Jan 2021 20:38:08 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sun, 24 Jan 2021 20:38:22 GMT):<br/>

https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/LMDWG/Lab+Sponsors+Proposal @lehors @tkuhrt @trbs I have made an initial stab at the Labs Sponsors Proposal where I argue for getting rid of the sponsor requirement. Thanks to @Bobbijn.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 14:45:06 GMT):<br/>
Couple of points regarding licenses:
1. CC-By-4.0 is an acceptable Hyperledger license for documentation. 
2. All new lab repos (non-transferred labs) are created with an Apache 2.0 license file. Both Ry and myself do this when creating labs.
3. I have caught labs that are being transferred having the incorrect license in the past. It seems that I missed the most recent MIT one. I am assuming the ones that do not have LICENSE file are also transferred labs due to #2 above.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 14:46:08 GMT):<br/>
Regarding the wiki page, I am not sure I see where the proposal is to remove the lab sponsor. Just some text around what the sponsor does today. Is this page intended to provide a concise recommendation? Or is it to discuss the role/need for a lab sponsor?
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 14:46:33 GMT):<br/>
Sorry...I am sure that this was discussed in yesterday's call, but I have not had a chance to listen to the recording yet.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 15:49:24 GMT):<br/>
Before we propose removing the sponsor we look at the reality of today. I propose a specific recommendation for removal. However, I want to see what the other stewards think about this. This is meant to be a location where we can collaborate on our joint text. @lehors proposed removing sponsors- We need @trbs or you @tkuhrt to concur or demur. However, we want to address @bbehlendorf 's concern about harms that Sponsor's protect against.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 15:50:34 GMT):<br/>
In that context, my main argument is that Sponsor's as they function today DO NOT protect against any of those harms...
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 15:50:34 GMT):<br/>
In that context, my main argument is that Sponsors as they function today DO NOT protect against any of those harms... If you make their duties more onerous you run the risk of putting gating functions and discourage participation. We have to create more automation to handle governance issues. That with intervention by stewards will keep the labs program running smoothly AND address governance concerns. These are my thoughts
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 15:50:37 GMT):<br/>
as a part of this, I looked over the lab repos, and there are quite a few that need archived or were never used so could be deleted.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 15:51:49 GMT):<br/>
That is a different point @rjones
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 15:51:49 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 03 Mar 2021 14:05:15 GMT):<br/>
@rjones is it possible to push docker images to hyperledgerlabs/solang from github actions, or is this a little awkward with permissions? The docker hub builds are super slow, and github actions is already building a docker image, might as well push it from there.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 03 Mar 2021 14:19:05 GMT):<br/>
@seanyoung it is possible - take a look [at how this is published](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-go/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml). I'll add the secrets, `CR_*`, where needed
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 03 Mar 2021 14:20:31 GMT):<br/>
ah wait, that's for publishing to GitHub packages. If that is an option for you, it is much easier
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 03 Mar 2021 14:29:04 GMT):<br/>
@seanyoung use tokens: `DH_USER` and `DH_KEY` to publish.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Wed, 03 Mar 2021 15:00:01 GMT):<br/>
@rjones, perfect thank you!

@rjones @tkuhrt For my recently created Labs project (Weaver), I have documentation built on docusaurus that can publish to Github pages but needs the ability to create and edit a `gh-pages` branch in the main repository. Currently, I've just published from my fork, but I'd much prefer to be able to publish to `hyperledger-labs.github.io`. How can I go about doing that? More generally, what's the recommended way of publishing project docs? (Are there any ready instructions somewhere?)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 31 Mar 2021 14:26:52 GMT):<br/>
@vramaiitkgp once you publish to the new `gh-pages` branch it should be reflected on https://labs.hyperledger.org/weaver-dlt-interoperability/
</p>
<p><strong>vramaiitkgp</strong> (Thu, 01 Apr 2021 10:13:29 GMT):<br/>
@rjones I tried building and publishing to `gh-pages` but got the following (permission) error:
```

```

How do I get past this? FYI, I'm trying to publish documentation rooted in https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/weaver-dlt-interoperability/tree/main/documentation.
</p>
<p><strong>vramaiitkgp</strong> (Thu, 01 Apr 2021 10:22:14 GMT):<br/>
Does the documentation have to be in `/docs`? In the settings, I see an option to select that folder as the documentation root.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 01 Apr 2021 14:10:20 GMT):<br/>
the two options are `/docs` or `/`
</p>
<p><strong>vramaiitkgp</strong> (Thu, 01 Apr 2021 17:11:31 GMT):<br/>
OK, I moved `documentation` to `docs` and merged with main. But the `gh-pages` branch is behind main by a number of commits. So the pages aren't getting built.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 01 Apr 2021 17:20:20 GMT):<br/>
you'll need to update the branch, then.
</p>
<p><strong>vramaiitkgp</strong> (Thu, 01 Apr 2021 17:23:22 GMT):<br/>
OK, I manually published and it succeeded this time, but I'm getting a 404 where the project page should be: https://labs.hyperledger.org/weaver-dlt-interoperability/.

Don't know what I am doing wrong.
</p>
<p><strong>vramaiitkgp</strong> (Thu, 01 Apr 2021 17:26:17 GMT):<br/>
Publish from my fork works fine: https://vramakrishna.github.io/weaver-dlt-interoperability/. All I then did was replace `VRamakrishna` with `hyperleder-labs` in the docusaurus configuration.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>vramaiitkgp</strong> (Thu, 01 Apr 2021 17:55:39 GMT):<br/>
Anyway, thanks for your help.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 01 Apr 2021 17:56:57 GMT):<br/>
sure thing. I changed the setting to publish from `gh-pages/` instead of `gh-pages/docs`
</p>
<p><strong>vramaiitkgp</strong> (Thu, 01 Apr 2021 17:57:28 GMT):<br/>
OK, I'll keep that in mind.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 01 Apr 2021 17:57:39 GMT):<br/>
it should just work going forward
</p>
<p><strong>vramaiitkgp</strong> (Thu, 01 Apr 2021 17:58:06 GMT):<br/>
One more thing: how do we get an entry on this page: https://labs.hyperledger.org/
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 01 Apr 2021 18:00:51 GMT):<br/>
you have one - https://labs.hyperledger.org/labs/weaver-dlt-interoperability.html - the issue is the title in your lab proposal wasn't updated. you'll need to update it.
</p>
<p><strong>vramaiitkgp</strong> (Thu, 01 Apr 2021 18:03:32 GMT):<br/>
Oh, so I need to update the file in the `labs` folder in the proposal repo and submit a PR?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 01 Apr 2021 18:04:27 GMT):<br/>
yes. look at the format of one that shows up to see what needs edited
</p>
<p><strong>vramaiitkgp</strong> (Thu, 01 Apr 2021 18:04:54 GMT):<br/>

In an effort to help bridge the gaps between the various parts of the Hyperledger community the TSC has invited SIGs, WGs, and projects to join a TSC call and give a short presentation on what they are doing if they'd like.

@rjones Hi!

<p><strong>nizos</strong> (Mon, 26 Apr 2021 07:01:44 GMT):<br/>
I am 405 not found :)

I am working on a graduation project to develop a financial ecosystem built on blockchain technology. We chose to use Hyperledger Fabric for this.
</p>
<p><strong>nizos</strong> (Mon, 26 Apr 2021 07:06:03 GMT):<br/>
I have started by modifying the code of the test network and the token erc-20 example in the fabric samples repo.
</p>
<p><strong>nizos</strong> (Mon, 26 Apr 2021 07:07:15 GMT):<br/>
The current implementation is a simple 1 org, 1 peer, 1 orderer, 1 ca, 1 cli + couchdb configuration and it works.
</p>
<p><strong>nizos</strong> (Mon, 26 Apr 2021 07:07:57 GMT):<br/>
I am trying to now make it so that the hole thing can be deployed with a single docker compose up command
</p>
<p><strong>nizos</strong> (Mon, 26 Apr 2021 07:09:12 GMT):<br/>
But I wonder if it is meant to be deployed that way since a lot of scripts seem to need to run first. Scripts to create crypto, artifacts, etc...
</p>
<p><strong>nizos</strong> (Mon, 26 Apr 2021 07:10:03 GMT):<br/>
The goal is simply to make it easier for the other teams on the project to quickly deploy it locally when they need to work with it during development.
</p>
<p><strong>nizos</strong> (Mon, 26 Apr 2021 07:10:13 GMT):<br/>
Am I making much sense?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 26 Apr 2021 07:42:11 GMT):<br/>
Yes. Have you considered [minifab](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/minifabric)? It makes automating stuff like this very easy
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 26 Apr 2021 07:42:22 GMT):<br/>

@stevecerveny @lehors I don't think there are any repo setup steps needed - file the PR, transfer in the repos
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 17:58:25 GMT):<br/>
well, transfer is the setup in this case :)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 17:58:42 GMT):<br/>
@lehors if you could vote for your own proposal to archive that fabric lab I'd appreciate it. that or I can use `force majeure`

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 17:59:43 GMT):<br/>
isn't that a valid excuse for not having responded yet?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 18:02:06 GMT):<br/>
so that other repo was setup for that same lab but never used?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 18:02:22 GMT):<br/>
if so, then, yes, nuke it

@tkuhrt done.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 19:57:17 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt @lehors @VipinB @trbs you may have noticed that I moved all of the archived labs from the `hyperledger-labs-archives` to the main org. This will make `archiving` much easier to do, and reverse.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 19:58:06 GMT):<br/>
So no more hyperledger-labs-archives organization?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 19:58:10 GMT):<br/>
right.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 19:58:24 GMT):<br/>
well, it exists, but it is empty
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 19:58:27 GMT):<br/>
I was wondering why I was removed from the organization. Now it all makes sense.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 19:59:16 GMT):<br/>
I was noodling on one of Vipin's questions, and I realized that really didn't make sense for labs - archiving and unarchiving should be much easier, instead of the multi-step pain in the behind
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 20:00:06 GMT):<br/>
Also - lots of labs still using `master` branch. https://github.com/ryjones/repolister/blob/main/hyperledger-labs-repos-master-branch-default.json
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 20:00:10 GMT):<br/>
Archived flag is nice
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 20:00:30 GMT):<br/>
Yup, and I can delegate that, unlike repo transfers which is a pain
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 20:00:57 GMT):<br/>
Should we create issues for all the labs that still have master branch?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 20:02:04 GMT):<br/>
maybe?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 20:02:37 GMT):<br/>
Let me see if there is an easy way to do it via the API
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 04 Jun 2021 05:16:43 GMT):<br/>
I suspect this is something people don't even know about given that we recently discovered some didn't know we expected them to use the Apache 2 license
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 04 Jun 2021 05:17:24 GMT):<br/>
so this is something we should add to the documentation and yes, creating issues is a good idea
</p>
<p><strong>BrunoVavala</strong> (Fri, 04 Jun 2021 20:32:04 GMT):<br/>

Hi, @HritikGupta : Moving your DM to this channel so that we can ensure visibility.
> I was a hyperledger mentorship program mentee for the last year (2020) and worked on this project https://labs.hyperledger.org/labs/citizens-pulse.html, that was accepted in Hyperledger Labs
> We are maintaining this code in a public repo that's owned by my mentor and would like to move it to hyperledger-labs repo to invite more contributors
> Could you help me with an initial commit of creating a repo for the project so that I can push the code there?
If the public repo has DCO sign-offs and an Apache 2.0 license, we could have your mentor transfer the lab to @rjones (Github user : ryjones) so that he can then transfer into the hyperledger-labs organization. (I do not remember if I still have this access).

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 15 Jun 2021 20:32:52 GMT):<br/>
@frank-bee I added [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io), but you might need to log in to make it work? they wanted me to click through and do a bunch of stuff and I'm not willing to do that
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Wed, 16 Jun 2021 06:51:40 GMT):<br/>
Cool thanks!
Gitpod works even without this app. A developer can just use the badge in our readme.md to work with it.
The github app just  allows some extra features , it works like a bot and add some comments /links to PRs
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 16 Jun 2021 15:27:22 GMT):<br/>
I approved that, but it wanted additional configuration. I think you can do that configuration via a file in github directly
</p>
<p><strong>frank-bee</strong> (Sat, 19 Jun 2021 08:03:24 GMT):<br/>
sure..that worked.  I have configured a setup for gitpod now, quite nice. Could be interesting for other projects as well

Hi! The message is about https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/pluggable-hcs .

I created a Hedera testnet account and followed this tutorial https://docs.hedera.com/guides/resources/tutorials/getting-started-with-the-hedera-consensus-service-fabric-plugin .

The dev branch gives the following error at network launch step (./byfn.sh up -t 20):
```
========= Chaincode is packaged on peer0.org1 ===========

@barankilic did you run it on a linux box? If not, can you try it again on a linux system for example ubuntu? btw, testnet node 3 is unhealthy atm, you can remove it from first-network/hedera_env.json, otherwise hcscli may get stuck on creating HCS topics fro the demo
</p>
<p><strong>barankilic</strong> (Wed, 17 Nov 2021 10:22:08 GMT):<br/>
@xlswirlds Thank you for your answer. I did run it on Macos. I will try it with linux.
</p>

@xlswirlds Thanks. Running it on Linux and removing testnet node 3 solved the problem.

@rjones is possible to upgrade rust on the mac arm runner please? 1.56.1 would be great. 

I've tried upgrading using `arch -arm64 rustup default 1.56.1`, but I get 
`arch: posix_spawnp: rustup: Bad CPU type in executable`. Without `arch -arm64` rust get updated to x86 binaries.

Enjoy thanksgiving.

@seanyoung I think you were over-thinking it - I ran rustup, and look at the host triple
</p>

@seanyoung if doing that didn't work, let me know
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 25 Nov 2021 20:33:46 GMT):<br/>
@rjones that worked, thank you!
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 09:56:41 GMT):<br/>
@rjones I've been trying to build docker images on the mac arm runner, but I'm running into strange issues. gcc seems to crash https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang/runs/4382032789?check_suite_focus=true#step:3:9291 and https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang/runs/4385189296?check_suite_focus=true#step:3:6215

I have not seen this issue before. Is it possible that the docker or macos software needs an update? I know I'm clutching at straws here.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 15:39:14 GMT):<br/>
@seanyoung I could upgrade to Monterey, if you like. Docker did have a pending update, so I installed it. I also did a brew upgrade for: ```hyp@hyp-ci-arm ~ % brew outdated
automake (1.16.4) < 1.16.5
ccache (4.4) < 4.5.1
cmake (3.21.2) < 3.22.0
coreutils (8.32) < 9.0
gdbm (1.20) < 1.22
git (2.33.0) < 2.34.1
go (1.16.6) < 1.17.3
hiredis (1.0.0) < 1.0.2
htop (3.0.5) < 3.1.2
ncurses (6.2) < 6.3
ninja (1.10.2) < 1.10.2_1
openssl@1.1 (1.1.1k) < 1.1.1l_1
pcre2 (10.37_1) < 10.39
python@3.9 (3.9.6) < 3.9.9
readline (8.1) < 8.1.1
wget (1.21.1_1) < 1.21.2
```
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 15:39:48 GMT):<br/>
@rjones thank you! I'll give it another go.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 15:41:51 GMT):<br/>
I also bumped the CPU, swap, and RAM up in case it was running into limits there.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 15:42:39 GMT):<br/>
If you want me to upgrade to Monterey, I will, since you're _basically_ the only user of this machine. I usually don't upgrade the OS on machines in a CI stack
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 15:51:51 GMT):<br/>
hopefully this works and there is no need to upgrade.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 15:59:57 GMT):<br/>
I wonder if it is an issue of crossing the p/e core boundary or something
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 16:00:26 GMT):<br/>
this box has 4p, 4e. When I look, the build is only using 100% of 1 P core.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 16:00:35 GMT):<br/>
so, it's single-threaded
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 18:03:00 GMT):<br/>
The docker build got a little further this time, and failed on a different file. It does seem like a resource limitation. 

I thought the mac was fast, *before* I knew it was doing everything in a single thread.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 18:19:25 GMT):<br/>
I was shocked to see that as well. Parts of the build are multi-threaded, but it looks like a lot of it isn't.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 02 Dec 2021 18:24:14 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt @sownak - now that the name is decided, do you want me to rename BAF and move it from labs to the main org?

@rjones Yes please. We will then update the images and name with the logo once it is final.
