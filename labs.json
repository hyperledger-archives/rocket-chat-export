WE know what what we are going is revolutionary and makes what  you are currently unable to do with any current blockchain.As IBM partners for Blockcain we submitted the proposal for Hyperledger consideration. He have found easy, open collaboration from other industrial players. We thank you for your time. It is a pitty that yHyperledger could read and study our proposal in that time.

I wanted to share project @seanyoung has started that I think has a lot of potential to grow into something rather interesting - we are looking for other maintainers and contributors but I think we would like to propose it to labs before too long. It is a solidity-to-LLVM compiler using modern compiler tooling to generate LLVM IR with an antlr grammar: https://github.com/seanyoung/solang. What we (Burrow) have in mind is using the LLVM WASM backend to create a migration path for existing solidity code and also thinking about WASM-EVM interop within Burrow that can bring with it a host of advantages. In the context of Hyperledger I would like to see WASM emerge as a cross-framework point of integration for different projects (and I know others would too). On top of this it has the advantage of running through sane, mature, modern compiling machinery. \n\nI would be grateful for any feedback or guidance - particularly from labs stewards","username":"silasdavis","ts":"2019-01-04T17:14:04.248Z"}

The naming of the projects says that the proposal file should have the same name as the repo (We will also check non-collision with project names). Labs have been setup as a separate organization in github. \nNo problems either way about the npm naming- the labs names do not and will not collide with project names. But prefixing with @hyperledger instead of @hyperledger-labs may give the wrong impression. Therefore my choice is to use @hyperledger-labs. \nPlease also estimate effort for the npm package name change in case of migration to project status; is this not just a change in the package.json file that is part of the release? Also if migrating there should be release notes that will tell users to do a npm install for changing dependencies in package.json.

The developer effort should be pretty minimal indeed, what may give extra headache to certain users is their own processes (new package name means new approval from legal, etc). \nIt shouldn't be a huge effort anyhow and we could make it work with aliases to soften the punch. E.g. in the event of the project graduating we could publish the same package with both scopes, but until the graduation we can just stay on the @hyperledger-labs scope.
