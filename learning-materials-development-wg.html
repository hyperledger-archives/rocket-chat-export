Hi is there any good verification program for hyperledger / blockchain experts?
</p>
<p><strong>Mareddy</strong> (Tue, 26 Dec 2017 13:57:21 GMT):<br/>
Certification*
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 26 Dec 2017 16:04:35 GMT):<br/>
@Mareddy : You might be interested in this: https://www.hyperledger.org/resources/training. We at the Linux Foundation are also working to put together a certification program for Hyperledger Fabric. I do not expect that to be available for six months or more though.

Hi @tkuhrt - I am a co-founder of a Blockchain Startup and a Blockchain Trainer here in India. I have been conducting Online/On-premise Blockchain trainings for global participants. My trainings include Hyperledger Fabric, Composer and UI Development. I would like to contribute to this WG with my experience. Kindly guide...
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Sat, 30 Dec 2017 12:57:19 GMT):<br/>
Hi, @jadhavajay  - we would love to have you. I will be sending out some information after the new year on how to get involved. Stay tuned to this channel for a Doodle poll looking for a time for us to have our first call, as well as dial in details for a meeting. 
</p>
<p><strong>jadhavajay</strong> (Sat, 30 Dec 2017 12:59:18 GMT):<br/>
Thank Tracy, will wait for details..
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Sat, 30 Dec 2017 13:00:57 GMT):<br/>
In the meantime, we can start doing some brainstorming on the types of materials that we would like to produce. I have started a list here : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IKsBDQJKPAl18ecwGyY1ix_N_vaANCQ5H8JICpXnpuk. Feel free to make suggestions and add comments. 
</p>
<p><strong>jadhavajay</strong> (Sat, 30 Dec 2017 13:56:28 GMT):<br/>
Nice, thanks for sharing - just did a glance over the list. Can we also add topic-level breakup in each one of the course?
</p>

very important and critical trends are emerging in the blockchain space.. I have added that to the google document under advanced... its about "Blockchain convergence with AI ,IOT and Big-Data
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Sat, 30 Dec 2017 14:27:56 GMT):<br/>
Cool!
</p>
<p><strong>RammohanThirupasur</strong> (Sat, 30 Dec 2017 14:28:08 GMT):<br/>

hi some basic questions while im going through the training resources
</p>
<p><strong>ims43</strong> (Sun, 31 Dec 2017 11:41:24 GMT):<br/>
1. is there any high level diagram of how all the products for hyperledger work together?
</p>
<p><strong>ims43</strong> (Sun, 31 Dec 2017 11:42:24 GMT):<br/>
2. why is Indy separate from hyperledger, not a standard feature? Are there other options that make Indy one of many identifying options?
</p>
<p><strong>ims43</strong> (Sun, 31 Dec 2017 11:43:27 GMT):<br/>
3. Insted of Cello, what are the other options? I am assuming since a blockchain is on the 'cloud' and distributed its never down, thus the need for something like Cello would be the default choice vs. something that is on-premise
</p>

<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sun, 31 Dec 2017 15:18:45 GMT):<br/>
I recommend to develop clear concept descriptions of Blockchain, AI, IOT and Big-data
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Wed, 03 Jan 2018 19:02:08 GMT):<br/>
@ims43 : (1) Not really (2) Indy is a project within the Hyperledger umbrella. Are you asking about why it is not part of one of the other frameworks? (3) Cello is the only tool within Hyperledger that provides this functionality. Other options may exist (such as creating your own scripts) to deploy a blockchain network.

<p><strong>ishwaryak</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 06:55:05 GMT):<br/>
can anyone solve this error?
</p>
<p><strong>ims43</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 07:04:56 GMT):<br/>
hi @tkuhrt, as i understand indy stores the user's data but not on a db....this seems like is a mandatory part of a blockchain...thus this should be a default part of hyperledger. now the assumption im making is that user's profile is needed....is this not the case? or does each user have their own 'wallet' with hyperledger?
</p>
<p><strong>anbknaga</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 10:22:31 GMT):<br/>
Hey all, I am new to blockchain and even for programming except some basic C++ knowledge. . I would like to develop use cases and applications on blockchain.How would you suggest me to go forward? Can anyone help me with this? Thanks. Good Day
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 15:01:10 GMT):<br/>
@ishwaryak : This is not the right channel for questions on Hyperledger Fabric CA. Try the #fabric-ca channel
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 15:11:52 GMT):<br/>
@anbknaga : Have you found the Introductory course on edX? https://www.edx.org/course/blockchain-business-introduction-linuxfoundationx-lfs171x
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 15:13:26 GMT):<br/>
@ims43 : Probably the best place to have this conversation is in the #indy chat; however, the idea with Indy is that you take back control of your own identity. This means that you control who has access to your personal information. 
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 04 Jan 2018 15:14:02 GMT):<br/>
Also, could you help me understand what you mean when you say Hyperledger here? It looks like you are using it as in Hyperledger Fabric, but I want to be sure I am completely understanding the rest of your question.
</p>
<p><strong>anbknaga</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 03:49:15 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>anbknaga</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 04:57:17 GMT):<br/>
what abt the prg language that i need to learn? any suggesstions for brgineer?
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 18:00:34 GMT):<br/>

When studying the Charter of the Hyperledger Training and Education WG, I encounter a problem. The Charter specifies: "Material must be reviewed and approved by a minimum of two maintainers before it can be committed to the repository. New maintainers will be proposed by an existing maintainer and approved by a majority of existing maintainers." These rules are clear. As far as I can read there are currently no maintainers. Where can I read how the first two maintainers will be appointed? Can anybody help? Thanks in advance.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 17:12:42 GMT):<br/>
@SjirNijssen : During the TSC calls where we discussed the Training and Education WG, we do have people who have volunteered to be maintainers. We may not have set them up on Github yet, but we do have the following four maintainers -- @cbf (Chris Ferris), @amundson (Shawn Amundson), @baohua (Baohua Yang), and myself

I was trying to install sawtooth development environment SDK, it occurred to me that while I could install the sawtooth nodes itself the development environment installation guidelines were not very consistent especially if something went wrong I could not always tell the root cause.

the second problem I had is getting a stable environment set-up (I suppose that stable is a relative term which depend on the function and vary from one sdk language to another...)

anyway, I really liked the structure of the IBM documentation and I think it would be very smart to create a continuous installation to building a blockchain app

<p><strong>Everymans.ai</strong> (Fri, 02 Feb 2018 15:53:54 GMT):<br/>
Hi @Ishee good to meet you online.   You probably already know this but Hyperledger is a blockchain Linux Foundation project that supports 5 different blockchain frameworks.  Here is a link to Linux Hyperledger certification.  There is some programming but a mostly high-level introduction to the different frameworks and underlying features https://www.edx.org/course/blockchain-business-introduction-linuxfoundationx-lfs171x  I've completed that certification and it's excellent overview course with some programming.

IBM offers a blockchain Fabric course that shows you how to develop Fabric web-applications using Composer - a Hyperledge project also.  It also covers business application strategies and an engagement model for deploying selecting and deploying blockchain applications https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-blockchain-essentials-for-developers

Here are the IBM course related "build your first..." "Writing Your First Application" links https://goo.gl/bc6D7k   https://goo.gl/xFg9cG

There are many other online blockchain courses but these are good starting points.

Lastly, I will be a Subject Matter Expert/Learning Facilitator on Oxford Blockchain Strategy Programme the first programme cohort will start on 28 Februrary 2018, and will run for 6 weeks https://goo.gl/Q3iBC8.  It's executive education level program so no web-application development but blockchain implementation business strategy.

I'd like to introduce myself -- my name is David Boswell and I recently joined Hyperledger as one of the Directors of Ecosystem.  One of the things I'm focused on is helping build a community around Hyperledger training and education efforts.

I see that there are many people on the Training and Education channel, although it doesn't look like the group has met yet.  I wanted to find a good time for us to have a call to meet each other and talk about our interested and priorities.

Can everyone please respond to this Doodle poll and we'll find a good time that works for the group?

https://doodle.com/poll/26ww5zfukdkd3vn7

Note that I was picking times that worked well for the US and Europe.  Going forward, we can alternate between European-friendly and Asian-friendly time zones if that would help bring more people into discussions.

Hi @angelsuarez -- glad to hear you're looking forward to hearing more about the working group.  For that doc, my understanding is that it was a first pass at potential projects that the group might tackle -- intended as a way to start gathering ideas that we could then pick from and prioritize.  it was created before i joined the project though, so perhaps other people here in the channel have more background on it to share.

Hi, Domingo. The WG has yet to develop any materials, as the first meeting will be on Monday. We would love to have someone who can translate the material into different languages, including Spanish. If you would be interested, we would love to have your contributions. Please feel free to add your ideas to the [training inventory document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IKsBDQJKPAl18ecwGyY1ix_N_vaANCQ5H8JICpXnpuk/edit) that the WG should consider creating.

Hi, @DomingoLiotta At the University of Maastricht I am assisting (as emeritus) in the preparation of educational materials to describe to specific audiences such as management, end users, politicians, blockchain architects or blockchain application developers the conceptual perspective of permissioned blockchain technology, with initial focus on Hyperledger Fabric. We feel this aspect needs priority to make Hyperledger more widely accepted in the community at large. Please feel free to communicate of line to Sjir.nijssen@pna-group-com. I agree with Tracy that having a version in Spanish would be fantastic. In my younger years I visited Spain many times and I love that language. Kind regards  Sjir

@DomingoLiotta @SjirNijssen I am a US resident but my mother tongue is German and will consider translating training material to German or team up with someone.  

There are some very good "management/conceptual perspective" blockchain online certification courses that I've taken and am on the teaching team for University of Oxfords new Blockchain executive education course (starts March 28th lasts 6 weeks, next course starts May 9th).  Based on the curriculum outline and course description it is taught from a business strategy perspective for executives similar to MIT AI: Implication for Business Strategy for which I am the course manager (both courses are designed by same excellent online course design company).  

The management / business implication perspective is key to correctly educate decision makers on the "what" not "how" of operationalizing disruptive technologies.  These top-tier universities' online courses have on the average 700 executive students from around the world attending.  I am looking for ways to introduce Hyperledger Fabric to executives as an enterprise blockchain framework example without appearing to "pitch".

By the way, if anyone is interested in exploring combining Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence, I am working on an architecture for integrating machine learning algorithms with DAO to build Intelligent DAO or IDAOs.  My email is george@everymans.ai

Hi George, @Everymans.ai Thanks for your interesting message. I just took a look at the Oxford Blockchain Strategy Programme. It has the following: "When adressing blockchain, programmes or educational materials cater to either a high-level, superficial discussion, or a low-level, granular and deeply technical explanation of blockchain technology." I have to agree, but regret to say so. I therefore are in favour of focussing in our WG entirely on Permissioned Blockchains as supported by Hyperledger Fabric. 
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 16:57:46 GMT):<br/>
And make a clear distinction between the education and traning materials for senior management, other management, professional end users, blockchain system architects, chaincode developers and system programmers. We may discuss the DAO matter off line. Kind regards  Sjir

@SjirNijssen where did you get that quote?  Can you provide the link?  I don't understand what that means in relation to Permissioned vs. permissionless blockchain frameworks.  That is, designing a blockchain course not to focus on the technical aspect doesn't determine whether you are teaching permissioned or permisionless frameworks.  In matter of fact, that distinction is important for executives and managers to understand.

@Everymans.ai Hi George, you say: "That is, designing a blockchain course that does not focus on the technical aspect doesn't determine whether you are teaching permissioned or permisionless frameworks. In matter of fact, that distinction is important for executives and managers to understand." In my perspective the user experience is fundamentally different in a permissioned blockchain and therefore I propose we focus on permissioned blockchains. Permissioned is a fundamental aspect of the user experience, in my opinion, working in a trusted environment.

<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 17:13:33 GMT):<br/>
@Everymans.ai   At page 2, When addressing blockchain, programmes or educational materials cater to either a high-level, superficial
discussion, or a low-level, granular and deeply technical explanation of blockchain technology.  This is a copy paste from the PDF I downloaded.
</p>
<p><strong>Everymans.ai</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 17:16:18 GMT):<br/>
@SjirNijssen but don't you think that the permissioned vs. permissionless aspect of a blockchain application is transparent to the end user?  Why should users care because it is the IT and business analyst etc. should deal with that part of the design and implementation.  Regardless of whether the blockchain is permissioned or permissionless the end user shouldn't know the difference?  What am I not seeing?
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 24 Feb 2018 17:18:43 GMT):<br/>
@Everymans.ai Hi George, From my perspective I think that a permissioned blockchain is such a different experience as it is trusted and the data are not public. Furthermore with HLF you can apply selectively agreed distributed decision making.

@davidwboswell @tkuhrt  Hi all, In the Hyperledger Traning and Education Working Group Charter is stated under the sub heading Process of the Group: "Meetings will be held bi-weekly via teleconference." In the message on the T&D channel David Boswel said: "... we can alternate between European Friendly and  Asian-friendly times."  
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sun, 25 Feb 2018 08:15:17 GMT):<br/>
If the T&E WG would implement both rules, it would mean that the European Group and Asian Group would only meet once every 4 weeks. In my experience with WGs this frequency is not sufficient for a productive group. I therefore propose to have every two weeks a European-friendly and every two weeks an Asian-friendly telecon, but not in the same week. If some one has a better proposal, please bring it forward. Otherwise I would propose that you use this channel to vote in favour or against this proposal and that saves time in the telecon Monday. Thanks for your attention. Kind regards Sjir
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sun, 25 Feb 2018 08:51:52 GMT):<br/>
@Everymans.ai   I see in the E&T doc that you want a reaction to your proposal: "AI & Blockchain integration to build DAO with Intelligence, ie, IDAO.  Instead of just having deterministic Smart Contract coded instructions build in machine learning algorithm trained decision models.  The AI/ML technology stack is mature and API driven.  Combining an intelligent layer with a distributed, decentralized ledger layer is compelling and inevitable.  So high level management needs to have a strategic outlook and roadmap for how these 2 new computing layers will work together.  So, use AI (more mature than blockchain stack) to introduce blockchain technology and kill 2 birds with one stone.  Any thoughts please email george@everymans.ai or tag me in chat.hyperledger.org @everymans.ai"     I believe that it would be a good idea to first circulate a working paper to the members of the T & E WG outlining in a few pages that such an approach makes a reasonable chance with high level magagement. In my experiece (79 years old) AI is in the eyes of senior management far from mature; too many promises made in the past that have not come true. Yes, I believe AI is now more mature than 25 years ago, but let us be careful not to oversell it another time. Although I find your proposal very interesting, intellectually challenging and I would personally like to work with you to make a more detailed proposal on that combination, I propose not to have it as number 1 on the list of the T & E WG agenda for Monday. Kind regards

@SjirNijssen I didn't mean to make my idea #1 on the agenda.  I think David Boswell will determine the agenda. Also, why did you delete and then copy and paste my text into another row with your name associated?!   Please don't take credit for my content.

I am not sure if you are playing on words with "senior management" vs. management that is senior, 79 years old but I manage MIT's "AI: Implications for Business Strategies" monthly courses and there are on the average 600+ senior management paying $3,000 for a 6 week course because they know an AI roadmap is essential to become a data-driven organization.  Besides, AI is too broad of a term to use when instead better is to use advanced analytics/statistical learning and machine learning algorithms which Data Scientist should have a firm grasp on.  

I am NOT saying that AI is not more mature than 25 years ago, of course it is (now we have more data, GPUs, better algorithms eg, Deep learning), what I AM saying is that the AI technology stack is more mature than Blockchain's and AI has been on the executive's radar for many more years than blockchain.  Plus, blockchain has to deal with the negative media misinformation/missunderstanding of the cryptocurrencie debacles and it's relationship to blockchain.  AI can be used to shoehorn blockchain into an organization.  

For example, the immutability of a blockchain provides a great audit trail for enterprises using AI-based BPO/RPA agents. As BPO and RPA move towards more adaptive intelligence processes, we'll see an increased concern about audit trails around what they do and what they learn.

I am involved in a couple of AI / Blockchain initiatives and just wanted to share what I think would make a great marriage to get the first-mover advantage and a leg up on the other Blockchain foundations/frameworks which are coming out of the woodworks.  Why not kill 2 birds with one stone.  I have my Oxford Blockchain onboarding meeting tomorrow and Wed. I will know what the student profiles are of the Blockchain course and the student count.  I am also in discussions with another LSM platform who provides online course design services to top-tier universities looking to get involved in developing Blockchain/AI course material.

I am also in discussions with another LSM platform who provides online course design services to top-tier universities looking to get involved in developing Blockchain/AI course material.

</p>
<p><strong>angelsuarez</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 17:17:31 GMT):<br/>
oh alright, I thought it was kind of reserved only for this particular purpose
</p>
<p><strong>Everymans.ai</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 17:20:28 GMT):<br/>
from confusion to clarity... it is reserved during our Training and Education meeting :-)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/training-and-education-wg?msg=u5f9dYogvRJgwPYzM) @baohua : sorry for my delay in responding. I just got back a response on your question. We can work through one of the EdX Chinese partners (e.g., Tsinghua University). Specifically, we would copy the content to their sandbox, and then the TWGC would be able to translate inline using the online authoring tool. I can connect you via email to the folks within The Linux Foundation training organization, and they can kick off the process. Would that work? @guoger @ylsGit

@davidwboswell @tkuhrt  Hi! I've been gone for a while and now wondering what the POSSIBLE NEXT STEPs are to follow up on our last online intro meeting.  Below see my thoughts but want to check to make sure I am staying within working group protocol.  I also posted this in the Training Inventory Google sheet at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IKsBDQJKPAl18ecwGyY1ix_N_vaANCQ5H8JICpXnpuk

Hi George Polzer, I  would like to lead this AI Blockchain working group.  I have started to formulate a charter to form a rocket.chat dedicate AI Blockchain Channel.  According to David Boswell that is a requirement to set up a Channel.  I have the charter form.  I will report progress on chat.hyperledger.org.

Any thoughts how to move this forward? If you’d like to set up a time to discuss how you can learn/contribute please feel free to use my online calendar to find a convenient time for a call: http://meetme.so/georgepolzer We can use dial-in / desktop sharing http://gotomeet.me/georgepolzer  or tag me in chat.hyperledger.org @everymans.ai

FYI, here are the links to the MIT Sloan AI and Oxford Blockchain courses I am managing:

It would be good if we can on-board burrow developer to help us in the training and education as a contributor.Their chat room has only 250 people max because of lack of support for newcomers.  
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 05 Mar 2018 17:40:57 GMT):<br/>
@Everymans.ai : Are you interested in a separate working group from the training and education working group that would focus on AI and Blockchain?
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 05 Mar 2018 17:41:49 GMT):<br/>
If so, you will need to create a new charter and get it approved by the TSC. I am happy to work with you through the process. 
</p>
<p><strong>Everymans.ai</strong> (Mon, 05 Mar 2018 17:43:14 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt yes - definitely.  AI blockchain integration will be getting lots of visibility and I would like to help Hyperledger take advantage of this market movement.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 05 Mar 2018 17:44:23 GMT):<br/>
Alright. I will DM you and help you through the process of creating a new working group.
</p>
<p><strong>Everymans.ai</strong> (Mon, 05 Mar 2018 17:44:38 GMT):<br/>
perfect
</p>
<p><strong>Everymans.ai</strong> (Mon, 05 Mar 2018 17:48:43 GMT):<br/>
FYI, in both the MIT Sloan AI course I manage and the Oxford University course just launched students are asking integration questions.  So good time to capitalize and I am being invited to speak at AI conferences proposing AI / Blockchain as my presentation (which I am working on and can be the outline for a education-training course)
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 05 Mar 2018 17:58:43 GMT):<br/>
@slavikdmi : We do have a number of webinars that are Hyperledger focused that are free. You can find them here:

Does anyone have anything they'd like to add to the agenda for the next Training and Education WG call happening on Monday at 10 am pacific?

I've started on agenda with some follow up items we identified at the kick-off call, including reviewing the training inventory doc to identify where there is a critical mass of people interested in contributing and also some process-related items around how to structure the work and handle leadership of the group.

Please feel free to add to or edit the agenda I've started at:

looks good.  For burrow we can contact silas davis (moderator of burrow channel) he is working on documentation update for burrow so we can build on that without duplication, they also have lots for docs on monax website but some  topics are missing we can fill the gap.

Hi all. I'm interested in leading the training and education work group. I'm a California Community College educator/administrator (full time). I teach code and IoT in the community college system and I teach organizational development in a US graduate school (part time). I started working in open education in 1996 and I offer deep experience in instructional technology. I'm interested in the role because I'm good at getting initial project traction and I love working with transnational learners. I've been through the edX and Coursera courses, have been tooling around with blockchain/smart contracts for a year and my research focus is decentralized organizations that guide/enhance decentralized products. More about me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelly2ds/ Thanks, Kelly

Welcome, @richzhao - Check out https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/training-and-education/training-and-education-wg. It has links to past meeting notes. In addition, it has the inventories at the bottom. The first is what the WG would like to work on. The second is the one that Kelly started and if you know of any existing training material that is good, please add to it.

I created a Google Form as an experiment for adding an existing inventory of resources. Let's try using the form so that we can more efficiently manage when we have a larger cache to draw from for our curated or created training. If the Google Form seems to not be a good fit we can try Google Docs. I did try Sheets but readability is not good due to differing sizes of fields. https://goo.gl/forms/SAftT6D9BrKSKwHq1 == Form | https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/training-and-education/inventory-of-existing-training == wiki page and sample.

Hello all. I introduced myself via the email list, but I'll copy the summary here. I teach web/mobile app dev at James Madison University, in Virginia, USA (2hrs from Washington DC). I have a PhD in information systems, but my research passion is learning and motivation. I occasionally blog about [education](https://burningmindproject.org/) or [other random tech-related things](https://morphatic.com/). You can find me on twitter [@morphatic](https://twitter.com/morphatic), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/morganbenton/), [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_7NJHlgAAAAJ), and the [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/morgan.benton).

<p><strong>KellyCooper</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 00:06:28 GMT):<br/>
I am drafting several possible approaches, audiences, etc. on Breadth. Today I attended a webinar where for the 20** time I heard about the 'cool' version of blockchain and about the gazillions IoT devices headed our way. I'm open on how we approach breadth; however, I don't want us to be the cliche. I learned nothing from the webinar. When I think of breadth, I think of what is important to the non-developer or early developer audience, business owners, compliance officials; those who are ready to learn, serious in their intent, with limited time and/or high need. This audience may also include tech people in another area. In the past we considered novice users, expert beginners, competent performers and various experts. Does Breadth take our materials up to or through competent performers or do you prefer an entirely different approach? What are your thoughts on audience or topics for Breadth? 
</p>
<p><strong>KellyCooper</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 00:10:24 GMT):<br/>
Does anyone think we should put a list together to attend/listen in to some of the other Hyperledger WGs? They might be a great resource advisor for what we curate and create. 
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 08:53:45 GMT):<br/>
I am in support of the proposal that material developed by the T & E WG will by most readers "who are ready to learn, serious in their intent, with limited time and/or high need" be regarded as "learned something solid, useful for my profession and interesting". This is a  challenge, I hope the WG will adopt. I propose we develop initially a comprehensive set of concept definitions and specify explicitly for which audience a specific concept definition is a must, for which it is recommended and for which it is not relevant. My current estimate is that we will end up with between 300 and 500 definitions. I support the proposal by Kelly that "breadth takes our material up to and through competent performers". Yes, I believe it would be useful to listen in to some other WG's; however I would prefer to first agree on our goals, quality control procedures and process before we can decide which other WG's to listen in.

I also suggest a few volunteers go out and assess the various H installation materials. Note location, completion, effectiveness and recommend if the materials on setting up systems help in developing a mental model of how pieces work together and why. I found that a) do x, b) to know why, here is a link to documentation to be a bit disjointed and overwhelming.

Hello Everyone, I'm Luigi, computer science engineer with 10+ years experience. I have been working as a solution architect and technical product manager for web and mobile development until Dec 2016. From 2017 I started working as a freelance dedicating a lot of time studying & playing on blockchains (mainly Bitcoin and EVM). Now I am providing services like training, PoC, architectures and consultancy. A couple of months ago I have been involved on an Hyperledger project (fabric + composer) and so I started looking into the Hyperledger offers. In my opinion, Hyperledger could be one of the most important drivers for the worldwide blockchain's adoption. That's why I would be more than happy to join the Hyperldeger community and share some efforts. I thought to start with this group as training and education are one of my favourite fields. So, how can I be useful? :)

Below is the type of question that the material to be developed by the T&E WG should clearly answer, is my proposal.

Onderwerp: [Hyperledger-fabric] can you reconfigure/limit channel data after the fact?


  (not sure if this is something explained in the docs i haven't got to yet but here goes.)

  i audited LF's hyperledger course and, in the middle of that, i started to wonder about one of the examples. we had fisherman sarah, who caught tuna and sold them to a number of clients. now imagine that sarah and her clients have established their own channel, where they can all see sarah's catch, how much she sells to each client, and the common price she charges all of them. so, initially, her price to each of her clients is exactly the same so she has no problem with that data being part of that channel that everyone is allowed to see.

  after a while, sarah decides to give one of her clients (miriam) a discount, and would rather not have everyone else know about that. how would that be done, if it's even possible? until then, the price that sarah was charging was visible to everyone on the channel. if sarah suddenly wants to change that price for a single client, what has to happen?

  would the existing channel have to be reconfigured? partitioned?
rebuilt from scratch? and it's not clear that would even solve the problem since, all of a sudden, all of sarah's *other* clients would notice that they can't see her sale price to miriam anymore (or perhaps not see her sale price at all), so they might suspect
*something* was up.

  in general, then, once you establish a channel and it runs for a while, how hard is it to reconfigure what members of that channel are allowed to see?

@KellyCooper and @SjirNijssen -- for the Training WG call today, could you please update the agenda and add details and any relevant links for the topics you'd like to cover?  For instance, the depth discussion you brought up earlier would be great to cover on the call today.

<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 26 Mar 2018 16:32:26 GMT):<br/>
@KellyCooper : We could draw a line between breadth and depth, as cross-project vs. project-specific. However, there is also the breadth vs. depth question at a project level. In this case, I would say that most of our breadth of material could be used regardless of framework (e.g., Sawtooth, Fabric, etc.); whereas, the depth would still be project-specific.

<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Fri, 30 Mar 2018 07:34:02 GMT):<br/>
With respect to the Visual Dictionary I propose that we include for every concept and term the startdatetime of validity and if known the finishdatetime. Furthermore we need to have a provision for synonyms in the same context. E.g. there are in the latest Glossary (under development) of Hyperledger Fabric two terms that are synonym, member and organization. It is a excellent idea to have the connection with terms in another context that have the same or a different meaning. Once the WG agrees on which facts about concepts, terms, synonyms and context are relevant, I recommend we discuss the Visual representation perspective.

Wrt The OEI Course Design Rubric I propose that we add as first objective the course objective before we agree on Unit-level objectives,  and explicitly describe for which audience the course is most appropriate. In the case of the HL T&E WG my proposal is to describe in crystal clear language with illustrating and convincing examples which functionalities of Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Sawtooth are of interest to end users (consumers), business or government. If required let us specialize for the last three categories. I look forward to reactions.

I received some information that will be helpful to our group.
Rich Block, who is leading the Seattle Hyperledger meetup 
did a really great survey about what subjects 
about Blockchain and Hyperledger would be popular.
I believe this survey will positively influence our priorities and direction 
when we produce learning material.
Poll results are located here (PDF): https://goo.gl/P4W6i6

<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Mon, 02 Apr 2018 17:44:17 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 19:31:32 GMT):<br/>
@KellyCooper My preference would be to put in the coming months the priority on the quality of the Visual Dictionary. I see quite often that the use of Github consumes quite some energy. Once we have a reasonable number of concept definitions, that describe the essential concepts of HLF and their connections in an understandable and coherent way, with enough illustrating examples, I think we then can worry about Github or any other solution. Regards Sjir
</p>
<p><strong>KellyCooper</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 19:33:37 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/training-and-education-wg?msg=SaGctFaQNsoNg4Tgo) @SjirNijssen I will create some wiki examples because it helps to visualize from the start so we can make adjustments to the process all along. Thanks. :)
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 19:35:28 GMT):<br/>
@KellyCooper I forgot to say that a wiki could help with this first phase. Regards Sjir
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 19:49:04 GMT):<br/>
@KellyCooper Let me give an illustrating example. If I look at the edX glossary, I see: Block - A set of transactions that are bundled together and added to the chain at the same time.                                          This definition lacks some very fundamental aspects of a block in HLF. They are currently included in the new (in statu nascendi) version of the topic Ledger. So let us reuse as much as possble from the HLF documentation but give priority to quality, is my proposal.
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 20:00:47 GMT):<br/>
@KellyCooper I would also like to propose that we illustrate the concept definitions with clarifying examples.        Let me give another example from the edX Glossary: Key/Value Pair - It consists of two parts, one designated as a 'key', and another as a 'value'. The 'key' is an identifier that allows you to look up the 'value'. The 'value' is the data that is stored for a given 'key'. Suppose we have a group of things called CAR. Suppose a specific CAR is identified by CAR0. An example of a key value pair is <key:CAR0, value <color: blue>>. In natural language: the car identified with the key CAR0 has the color blue>. If this would be part of the World State, I would have said:  the car identified with the key CAR0 has currently the color blue>. The value can also be an ordered set of attributes-value pairs, such as key=CAR0, value = <color:blue, make:Toyota>. 
</p>
<p><strong>KellyCooper</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 20:08:04 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/training-and-education-wg?msg=ezTdumYFrwxtWpgDF) @SjirNijssen Y. The edX glossary was intended as a first set of terms to start with. Please feel free to select a few and create a wiki. A few of us can do the same then assess for workability and layout. Thanks!

@davidwboswell @tkuhrt  @KellyCooper I wanted to send this to all people that have subscribed; In the fabric-documentation channel Varun Ray wrote yesterday: "It's a very long learning curve for anyone who jumps in without prior knowledge in blockchain architecture." Kim Letkeman wrote this morning on the hyperledger lists: "There is a significant learning curve before you get to minutia like which database you should plug in." I hope the Training and Education WG translates this in a challenge. My proposed solution: let us produce integrated learning materials where fields, concepts definitions, integrity rules, derivation rules and events are fully integrated and where possible, use visual vocabulary for communication productivity reasons, inluding scenario testing. If some has a better proposal, please let us know. Sjir  The message I got was: all in this room is not allowed. Could anybody explain the good reason why this is not allowed?   And how can I send a message to the persons that have attended any of the 4 telecons? Sjir    
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 14:32:01 GMT):<br/>
@SjirNijssen -- to reach the people who have been to the last teleconferences, i would recommend posting to the training mailing list.  there are over 150 people subscribed there.
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 16:21:39 GMT):<br/>
@davidwboswell @KellyCooper @tkuhrt  David, Thanks for the answer. I thought I did that when I selected the option: all. The system then said: I will not communicate this message to others, it is only visible to you. So my interpretation was I tried to post to the training mailist list, but apparently I do lack that permission, or do you have another interpretation?
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 16:23:34 GMT):<br/>
@SjirNijssen -- the all command in chat is different from the mailing list.  That command gives a notification to everyone in a channel and I think was turned off to avoid spamming people -- you can send send a notification to people by including their handle in a post.  for the mailing list, you can send to that by emailing hyperledger-training-and-education-wg@lists.hyperledger.org
</p>

Hello everyone. I'll be at the IoT Conference in Malmö, Sweden this coming week (https://www.iotconf.se/). Will anyone else be there who would like to get together? Alternatively, is there anything I could do to help out this group while I'm there, e.g. advertising/recruiting?

Sounds good.  IMO talking head vids may not be the best just due to how quickly things change. I expect that there will be continuous need to update them.  But if that's the direction we want to go then I'm happy to help.

I'll switch that conversation over to our list and to this channel (later today). At this point 1-2 minute conceptual videos that are evergreen will help a lot. Yes, with the edX course, current videos have posed a challenge in this quickly changing landscape. How would you like to proceed. Shall we write up scripts? My question is how do you like to work so we can best get you what you need? Thanks!

<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Mon, 14 May 2018 21:17:47 GMT):<br/>
@KellyCooper @chart01 In my opinion the main questions are: targeted at which audience? Don't forget there is hardly any material for managers (decision makers), blockchain architects, client application developers or application chaincode developers. Hence I would recommend to select an audience and my preference would be first the managers and thereafter the blockchain architects and thereafter the third and fourth mentioned. Second question is: what is for that audience the best animated PPT? My experience with fabric is the lifecycle of the client application transaction. Third suggestion: do at the same time for Fabric and Sawtooth.

Hi all! I’m gathering groups of trainees for Hyperledger Fabric training course. It’s a 3-day offline class available in SF, NYC, London and other locations. You will get personal attention of an experienced trainer and become fully armed to build blockchain applications of any complexity on your own. The course focuses on step-by-step network deployment using the toolkit designed by Altoros’s engineering team; adding organizations on the go, installing and instantiating the chaincode. We can cover both local and multi-server deployment mode at the training. Here you can find program & schedule: https://www.altoros.com/course/blockchain-hyperledger/advanced-training-hyperledger-fabric-3-days.html

Can someone help me figuring out the real advantage of Blockchain comparing it with a Disturbed database system.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/training-and-education-wg?msg=9AqwX2GM4GjgG4EKW) @phanikumar We are the group who creates training materials more than the Q&A for learners. If you have not, you might want to check out the free edX.org course on blockchain. There are major differences between blockchain and distributed database systems, if you can set a context I can better target an answer. Thanks, Kelly

<p><strong>phanikumar</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 19:17:56 GMT):<br/>
my friend is working in software industry on a banking domain. We initialized a discussion on how Blockchain fits Banking sector and he posed a question can't we achieve it through a relational database distributed in various locations.
</p>
<p><strong>phanikumar</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 19:23:11 GMT):<br/>
I raised points like immutability, transparency and trust. He replied back stating that in RDMS there will be access controls by which immutability is achieved furthermore Blockchain is again using the database in the background. In business network access will only be granted to trusted(authenticated) parties. As banking sector keeps all the records of a transaction transparency can also be achieved to some extent. So what makes Blockchain so special is the centralized point?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/training-and-education-wg?msg=FxjJBdk68TsATCW5B) When I read your question I think of many moons ago when everyone wondered why not stick with COBOL? Tested, secure, middleware still in play. I think (my opinion) blockchain will be an alternative for banking and will gain traction as it becomes validated beyond its potential. It's a bit dicey to defend or refute products this early, especially when they have global hype. You might want to check into the Hyperledger Fabric documentation; if you go to this link, and you will also see more information in the left nav menu. https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.1/arch-deep-dive.html. Rather than considering immutability, transparency and trust, consider the architecture. Our group is starting to work on use cases that are more business-centric. IBM also has a few banking use cases that are interesting as an overview https://goo.gl/MQVLyL Thanks, Kelly

<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 22 May 2018 20:25:55 GMT):<br/>
@phanikumar : Here are some questions I would ask regarding an RDBMS that exists at multiple locations. Which one is the system of record? How much reconciliation is needed to ensure that the data is the same in all instances?  Who has the correct version? The idea behind blockchain is that everyone has the same system of record, no reconciliation is needed, and everyone has the same version.

</p>
<p><strong>roleybrown</strong> (Wed, 23 May 2018 12:29:32 GMT):<br/>
@phanikumar - My thoughts, if I may. A database, irrespective of access control can be changed after data is commited by for instance a database administrator. Once again you trusting a central authority. In addition, replication of data can become a nightmare with all the integrity constraints across many relational databases(nodes). If I read and understand the documentation correctly, a blockchain only uses a database such as couchdb to record the current state.Still learning. The blockchain in itself stays immutable. Consensus on a blockchain in a trustless way prevents for instance duplication based on rules defined. Imagine the same record being updated on two different databases at the same time, without consensus, which one is correct? Databases and Blockchains both are great, each with their own strenghts and suited for different use cases. The edX Intro to HyperLegder course has a nice section on where blockchains are perhaps not ideal.

The Hyperledger T & E WG approved today the following: "•Proposed transaction: Let us select the 15 most essential concepts (is not terms) in Fabric, Sawtooth, Burrow and Iroha, and describe clearly, using illustrating relevant examples, understandable to end users and management, how they relate, overlap and where they are different; look forward to endorsements."

On behalf of the WG I submit to you the first two concepts descriptions:   A blockchain is an append-only data structure; a blockchain (instance) consists at any moment in time of a number of blocks. A block contains a number of transactions. The contents of a block is encrypted and each block contains a hash of major parts. It contains also a copy of the hash of the previous block and this is the reason for the term chain. A transaction proposal is a proposal by a client application or administrator to the blockchain network community. The network community can decide to make the transaction proposal a valid transaction, or is classified as an invalid transaction. Please let us know which improvements you want to make to these two concept definitions. Thanks

@amundson, @roleybrown @KellyCooper @Dan @yacovm and members of the T & E WG: A few days ago the first two concept definitions for the blockchain concepts were offered in the Fabric, Sawtooth, Iroha and Burrow channel. The suggestions on these first two are now processed  and together with 4 additional concept definitions available for review at https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/training-and-education/list-of-blockchain-core-concepts . Please feel invited to a critical review.

</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 19:27:01 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @SjirNijssen. Minor feedback:  "Global State" is more common term than "World State"
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 19:27:45 GMT):<br/>
Also @SjirNijssen sawtooth blocks contain atomic collections of transactions we call batches. Please see earlier link i provided to documentation.
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 19:30:08 GMT):<br/>
@Dan Thanks Dan; I will bring in both terms in the next version. Is it not the case that Global State is more used in the Sawtooth community and World State more in the Fabric community? The concept of atomic transaction will come in in a later increment as it is indeed a core concept.
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 19:31:09 GMT):<br/>
@Dan Hence the term batch as used in Sawtooth will be included in one of the next increments.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 19:34:19 GMT):<br/>
I believe global state is a more normative term. Random paper with search hit: https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Lynch/tse82.pdf
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 20:05:11 GMT):<br/>
@Dan I checked with a well known search engine: global state 1.7 billion; world state 3.5 billion. I propose we declare them synonyms in the blockchain engineering community. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 20:30:24 GMT):<br/>
I'm really not sure why it's even worth to define the hash in that core concept.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 20:30:40 GMT):<br/>
Hash functions are used for many things, not just blockchains
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 20:31:29 GMT):<br/>
also - the hash definition isn't ideal IMO
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 20:31:43 GMT):<br/>
> Hash A hash about a variable length piece of data results in a unique fixed length data field. The hash is a function that assigns to the variable length field a unique fixed length data field. It is not possible to reconstruct from the hash the variable length data field. Hence a hash is a one-way function. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 20:33:42 GMT):<br/>
The 1-wayness isn't really rigorously defined, as the impossibility to reconstruct the preimage is only when the input is sampled from a high entropy distribution 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 20:34:02 GMT):<br/>
also - the hash needs to be collision resistant, that wasn't mentioned in the definition above.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 20:35:58 GMT):<br/>
I'd say we drop the hash definition completely from that document as it's something that is used for many, many things in cryptography (commitment schemes, encryption, authentication, signatures)
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 20:38:55 GMT):<br/>
Also - what about peers? every blockchain has peers, right? where are they in the core concepts?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 20:39:47 GMT):<br/>
Also I'm missing the "consensus" core concept - every blockchain obviously has some sort of consensus (be in PoW, PoS, CFT, BFT, etc. etc.) 
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 20:47:43 GMT):<br/>
agree that drop the hash or reference an existing defn.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 20:49:24 GMT):<br/>
@SjirNijssen you need to quote your phrase to search engines (world state) != ("world state"); moreover it needs to be in the right context like (distributed ledger "global state"). 
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 20:49:51 GMT):<br/>
@Dan Google
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 20:50:27 GMT):<br/>
I mean you need to use quotation marks around phrases
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 20:50:32 GMT):<br/>
@Dan then we have to agree in which context
</p>

@Dan I followed your advice. "World state" 711.000; "Global state" 768.000 
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 20:57:52 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm The current list of 6 is only the second step. We will increase the number of concepts gradually. Consensus will definitely be one of them. I have to think more about your statements about hash.

@SjirNijssen @Dan : I too think that World State is not the right term. I would personally change it to "State" and then specify that in Fabric this is what is termed "World State" and in Sawtooth this is what is termed as "Global State"

<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 21:34:31 GMT):<br/>
@chart01 : I am still waiting to hear back from the folks who control the brand guidelines on the "newest" guidelines. Hopefully soon.

@tkuhrt Good suggestions, thanks. Wrt state, I agree that state and transition are well established concepts in computer science, and then give the special terms World State used in Fabric and Global State used in Sawtooth.I will include Indy in the list of frameworks invited to comment and contribute.

Please respond to this doodle poll regarding the T&E Working Group meeting time. This poll reflects one day; our volunteers in China have requested we consider an earlier start time. 10:00 am PST is 1:00 am in China. I note 7:00 am PST, 8:00 am PST, 9:00 am PST and 10:00 am PST as options. I note one day only, the time would carry across meeting dates already established. With this change China volunteers can attend at 10 pm, 11 pm or midnight. https://doodle.com/poll/cvz5tewfdevqih3d Thanks for replying to the poll. Kelly

The response to the first two concept definitions has been enouraging. As a result there are now in the second increment 8 concept definitions. The proposal has been extended to make the concept list specific for 6 audiances, decision makers and end users, blockchain architects and blockchain consultants, admins, client application developers, smart contract developers and Hyperledger Platform developers. Everyone is invited to add his suggestions at https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/training-and-education/list-of-blockchain-core-concepts Thanks for your help

@KellyCooper @roleybrown @amundson @dan @yacovm @tkuhrt and members of the Training & Education WG, The feedback of amundson is incorporated, as well as Dan's and Tracy's. The feedback of yacov about the concept hash has hastened the introduction of concepts list per audience; the feedback of Yacov was probably directed towards computer scientists or software engineers and I did not want to go that deep for decision makers and end users. So yacovm when we move up through the six audiances you suggestions will there get additional space. The response to the first two concept definitions has been enouraging.

I... have to say that I don't want to sound too intrusive in my feedback, and - that it beyond my jurisdiction as I'm not a member of the T&E WG, but - 
1) Though the idea of different documentation for different audiences sounds appealing to me, i think that 6 categories is a bit too much and the ideal number revolves around the number 2...  there are those that need to understand the *what* and those that need to understand the *how*. At least - that's how i see it.
2) The separation into these 6 groups seems a bit ambiguous to me: "decision makers and end users" - who are decision makers? 
"blockchain consultants" and "administrators" , "client application developers" , "smart contract developers"  - I'm not sure why we need to separate the audiences that much... seems like redundancy in words to me :) 
also - "Hyperledger Platform developers" - is the T&E WG expected to write documentation for that target audience too?

> the feedback of Yacov was probably directed towards computer scientists or software engineers and I did not want to go that deep for decision makers and end users
that's why I say it's best to drop the hash. A Hash isn't a blockchain concept...

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 10 Jun 2018 18:04:58 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sun, 10 Jun 2018 18:29:08 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm Thanks for your quick feedback. It will be discussed in the group. The reason that I propose the 6 lists is that the associated 6 jobs are different and need different concepts. The reason to include a special group of Hyperledger Platform developers is to make it more productive for newbees to start work in that community. I believe it will help if there were a concept list of between 400 and 500 entries. May I ask you another question: I am trying the find the code of the transaction proposal where clientID, chaincodeID, function, arguments, timestamp and clientSig are used. I have studied master/protos/peer/proposal.proto and  peer/proposal_response.proto. However these fields are not used there. Do you know where in the code the list of clientID etc is used? Thanks for your attention.

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 10 Jun 2018 18:37:07 GMT):<br/>
> The reason that I propose the 6 lists is that the associated 6 jobs are different and need different concepts. 

yeah... i really don't want to continue arguing so i'll cease at this point, and only say that i know people that call themselves "blockchain consultants" and their knowledge level is below the first category. what class should they pick? ;) 

chaincodeID https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.1/protos/peer/chaincode.proto#L72 
function, arguments https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.1/protos/peer/chaincode.proto#L54-L56 
there is no "client ID" - it's just the full certificate of the client - the creator field in https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.1/protos/common/common.proto#L119-L125 
the signature is here: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.1/protos/common/common.proto#L137-L144

the timestamp is in the channel header : https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/release-1.1/protos/common/common.proto#L89

<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sun, 10 Jun 2018 18:41:40 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm Thank you very much for the documents. I will study them. Wrt "what class they should they pick". We probably agree that the topic blockchain is the queen of all fake news in computer science history. I propose we focus on the contents of Fabric as that is really interesting and not fake. 
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Mon, 11 Jun 2018 08:31:32 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm I wish I had seen these months before. I made a mistake by trusting the Architecture section "Basic workflow of transaction endorsement". I think we need to correct this situation as soon as we have time. A little question: I do not see why we need both L54-L56 and L72? Or do I miss something?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 11 Jun 2018 08:35:23 GMT):<br/>
you are the one that asked for the chaincode ID 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 11 Jun 2018 08:35:32 GMT):<br/>
I don't need both...
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Mon, 11 Jun 2018 08:36:16 GMT):<br/>
I have compared the contents and they are the same. So why have both?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 11 Jun 2018 08:38:20 GMT):<br/>
can you paste them here?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Mon, 11 Jun 2018 08:38:24 GMT):<br/>
they don't look the same to me
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Mon, 11 Jun 2018 08:38:54 GMT):<br/>

@yacovm Thanks for the 5 references you suggested on Sunday. I am carefully studying them. I will propose to rewrite the part of the docs chapter Architecture called "2. Basic workflow of transaction endorsement" as it is out of sync with the code.  Wrt L72 I have a question: the comment related to "message ChaincodeInput" says: "Carries the chaincode function and its arguments". I see the arguments as field 1. But field 2 is a map and I think  function of a chaincode is not a map. Can you please shed some light, or tell me which error I make in the interpretation?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 12 Jun 2018 07:42:17 GMT):<br/>
@SjirNijssen - the chaincode function is just the first argument. the rest are the actual arguments.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Tue, 12 Jun 2018 07:42:30 GMT):<br/>
field 2 is something else not related to the deal

@kellyCooper, @rdmross @nathalie-ckc @Dan @amundson @nathalie-ckc @abraham @roleybrown @laurasp @richzhao @phanikumar @brockhager @eramitg @LuigiRiva @punit 4 @jsalvachua @kakuzu @baohua @DomingoLiotta @angelsuarez @chart01 and all other members of the T & E WG                     If you have time to critically look at the first 15 concecpt definitions for the first audience, decision makers and end users, please let me know what you think should be improved. They are at: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/training-and-education/list-of-blockchain-core-concepts
Hence we start with 
1.	the decision makers and end users, and work from there back (or forward?) via 
2.	the blockchain architects, 
3.	the admins, 
4.	the client application developers,
5.	the smart contract developers and
6.	system chain code developers.
This is in my view the best Education & Training approach, although most others in blockchain communities do it the other way around. Thanks for your attantion.

@fcioanca & others looking at the edX MOOC Forum: Are any of the rest of you having the issue where the edX editor format buttons are not showing? In this picture, above the blue edit window outline, where I hovered my mouse to get the shortcut key, there used to be format button icons, instead of just the blank white, separated by grey vertical lines:

@richzhao @ikocsis  May I ask you to very critically look at the first 15 concept definitions Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Mon, 18 Jun 2018 14:47:35 GMT):<br/>
Sjir, if you are already here :), just a quick feedback on the core concepts proposal (and we can discuss it during the call): I think that the decision maker + end user concept set is missing a bit the DLT concept + the "nice properties when implemented with Blockchain" (that's partially covered, though)
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Mon, 18 Jun 2018 14:48:48 GMT):<br/>
@ikocsis @richzhao  The 15 are at https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/training-and-education/list-of-blockchain-core-concepts
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Mon, 18 Jun 2018 14:49:52 GMT):<br/>
@ikocsis I will gladly bring in the concept DLT, if we can agree that Fabric is not limited to assets
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Mon, 18 Jun 2018 14:50:21 GMT):<br/>
And for the definitions, I don't know whether you looked at NISTIR 8202
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Mon, 18 Jun 2018 14:50:46 GMT):<br/>
May be useful, the NIST people seem to have put in quite a bit of work
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Mon, 18 Jun 2018 14:50:59 GMT):<br/>
@ikocsis What do you think is not covered? Please let me know and we can jointly improve.
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Mon, 18 Jun 2018 14:54:42 GMT):<br/>
Chaincode/smart contract seem to be missing, or at least the fact that the thing is "user-programmable"
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Mon, 18 Jun 2018 14:55:16 GMT):<br/>
I was looking for irrepudiability, but that's actually there, just called differently
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Mon, 18 Jun 2018 14:55:49 GMT):<br/>
On DLT: I certainly fully agree that Fabric is not limited to assets
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Mon, 18 Jun 2018 14:56:25 GMT):<br/>
It's actually a really good concept set, I have to ponder a bit on it
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Mon, 18 Jun 2018 15:00:15 GMT):<br/>
I personally would introduce some hierarchy  - say, service (as Blockchain is pretty much becoming a middleware of sorts) - properties - system actors & components - data structures & algorithms
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Mon, 18 Jun 2018 15:01:27 GMT):<br/>
But this is basically just throwing up the concepts themselves on a MindMap, what I will try to do to see whether is makes sense
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Mon, 18 Jun 2018 15:02:31 GMT):<br/>
@ikocsis Imre, I think you are right; I am happy to bring in the concept Smart contracts. I hope we agree there is a lot of fake news about that concept and I propose we only bring solid news. Do we agree on those points?
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Mon, 18 Jun 2018 15:04:00 GMT):<br/>
Yes, of course
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Mon, 18 Jun 2018 15:05:56 GMT):<br/>
I'm rather practical on "smart contracts" - they are neither smart, nor contracts, as we say :) So I would introduce them in the CS/CS sense - if someone wants to use it to create funny money, that's certainly an option, but not core to the concept as it stands now (and most certainly not in consortial, permissioned Blockchains)
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Mon, 18 Jun 2018 15:08:16 GMT):<br/>
@ikocsis I agree; so we have to clear up quite some misunstandings about smart contracts. How many persons have you met that have studied law and are able to express themselves in Go, or Java?
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Mon, 18 Jun 2018 15:14:31 GMT):<br/>
Exactly one, but that's a strange guy :)
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Mon, 18 Jun 2018 15:18:59 GMT):<br/>
@ikocsis Thanks for your answer.  Your suggestion to add smart contracts to the list of core concepts for the first audience is a very good one. I will include it after the telecon of today where I hope to receive additional feedback that can be used for the next version. I hope to be able to start work on the second audience this week.

<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 20:36:19 GMT):<br/>
@richzhao : I have not looked at the document yet, but these are core concepts of Fabric (at least CA MSP, chaincode). Are these core concepts supposed to be project agnostic?
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 20:46:47 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt The idea is to gradually build up a top quality knowledge description of all the Hyperledger projects to be used as basis to develop Training & Education material. There are some concepts that only apply to a subset and they need to be included as long as we specify clearly to which project they apply and where not. Hence if a concept is only available in say Fabric, then this needs to be specified. 
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 20:59:53 GMT):<br/>
Things that are concepts specific to a particular project should exist in the documentation for those projects, and we should just link to that information, not create a separate version. @SjirNijssen 
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 21:00:31 GMT):<br/>
If we don't like what exists there or it doesn't exist, then we should do a pull request against the documentation for those projects.

<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 23 Jun 2018 10:02:11 GMT):<br/>
@richzhao Thanks for your contribution to the concept list. Before I can react effectively I would like to establish that we want to use a consistent and in principle complete list of concept definitions for a specific audience as the basis for the training & education materials. I hope we agree that some boxes are black for some audiences and the same box is white for other audiences. I have proposed to distinguish 6 different but related audiences and that we start from the end user and decision maker point of view. The next one would be the blockchain architect. Could you agree with those principles?
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 23 Jun 2018 10:11:38 GMT):<br/>
@ikocsis Imre, I am pretty sure that we agree that there is a lof of confusion about the term smart contract and chaincode. I have a proposal that fundamentally could end that confusion. However that means that we have to go to the atoms of the blockchain (a macromulecule) and the world state. The proposal is to consider each and every transaction as a set of facts, and to also consider each and every state (world state in Fabric) as a set of facts. What do you think of this?

I found a tool I really like for helping people understand the concepts of hashes, transactions, blocks and blockchain that might be useful in your "concepts" documents.  https://anders.com/blockchain/.

@Bobbijn I suggest the following addition: develop separate high quality materials for various audiences like end users, decision makers, blockchain architects, administrators, client application developers and smart contract developers. 
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Mon, 02 Jul 2018 16:41:03 GMT):<br/>
@Bobbijn The reason for separate (but related) materials for the various audiences is that e.g. end users have to know far less concepts than e.g. blockchain architects, while client applications developers have to know currently several interface conventions that are not relevant for end users, nor blockchain architects.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/training-and-education-wg?msg=xoBPmA6xEGsRacxkQ) @Bobbijn  Materials for the work group are housed within Hyperledger, is this survey one you're developing and hosting as we review? I was away at the last meeting, I may have missed something. I see a survey on Weebly, with links to your commercial endeavor? Sorry if I'm way off track, can you set the context? Thanks, Kelly :)

@Thaddeus You are very welcome. It would be a good step forward if we could have the Burrow and Iroha input for the concept list for the audience end user and decision maker. The next list is for the audience blockchain architects, which I would like to start after the Monday telecon. The current list is here: : https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/training-and-education/list-of-blockchain-core-concepts Feel invited to update the list and bring in as many concepts of Burrow and Iroha as you deem useful either as specializations of the current list or additions. Thanks for your initiative.

@igor-egorov Thank you for your offer to contribute. We have developed in the last two months the concept list for the first audience, consisting of end users and decision makers. The next audience will be blockchain architects. Could you please have a look at the current list: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/training-and-education/list-of-blockchain-core-concepts Feel invited to update the list and bring in as many concepts of Iroha as you deem useful either as specializations of the current list or additions.

@Chris0708 Welcome to the HL T & E WG ; please take a critical look at the first list of concepts and let us know which definitions can be improved at: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/training-and-education/list-of-blockchain-core-concepts; which area do you want to focus on?

<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 16 Jul 2018 21:51:28 GMT):<br/>
@Bobbijn : Was taking a look at the survey. It is important that we not require personal details (name) from people who submit the surveys. Can we make this an optional field?

For the "Why did you join the group", would it be better to provide a set of radio boxes (e.g., To contribute educational material, To learn about Hyperledger (the organization), To learn about a specific framework (If they choose this, maybe have them list which ones), To obtain educational material for use in a course I am teaching, To review content that is being created, As a Subject Matter Expert on one of the projects, etc...)

Maybe then the how you want to participate could be directed towards those type of items included above.

I am not sure I understand what "Libraries Areas of Interest" is.

We might want to include the following questions:
* Github experience
* one that is somewhat open ended (or at least with an Other) that asks what tools people have used to create training courses in the past (EdX, Udemy, PowerPoint, Google Slides, etc.)
* another open ended question surrounding where people look for training material online
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 16 Jul 2018 21:52:50 GMT):<br/>
And to piggyback on Kelly's remarks about where this survey is being hosted, we should probably consider survey monkey or Google Forms (although the latter may alienate people in countries where Google is not allowed)
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Tue, 17 Jul 2018 06:26:01 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt Very helpful suggestions. Please implement. The value of concept definitions not only for Hyperledger, also in surveys is once again well illustrated: "I am not sure I understand what "Libraries Areas of Interest" is. I expect you are not the only one. Thanks Tracey

@Chris0708 Thanks for the 3 pages of suggestions. I read them once and they deserve more time. I will study them later today and get in contact. Regards  
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Wed, 18 Jul 2018 16:04:07 GMT):<br/>
@Chris0708 and all other members of the Hyperledger T & E WG. I propose we discuss the various aspects step by step such that every member of the WG can contribute.                       I prefer to refer positively to the intended audience as end users and decision makers.                       Please let us know if you support or do not support this.     I believe we are in agreement that the first concept to describe is blockchain. As a result of the proposal of Chris I propose the following new state of the Blockchain definition:   A blockchain is a chain of blocks each containing transaction data. Each block, except the first block, is linked to the previous block and each block except the last one is linked to the next block. Hence the link is not directional; block N contains, besides its own hash, a copy of the hash of the previous block.      Once a block has entered the blockchain, it is like chiselled in granite. This characterictic delivers the immutability of the data in the blockchain, also referred to as temper-free data or virually incorruptable data. This aspect is one of the main reasons for the broad interest in blockchain technology.            In computer science language a blockchain is an append-only data structure; a blockchain (instance) consists at any moment in time of a number of blocks. If the chain has N blocks, then it has N-1 links, for N>=1. Hence when there is only one block, there in no link.         Wrt Merkle-root, I do not believe that an enduser, nor decision maker is willing to invest energy in that concept.            If there are dimensions that I have overlooked, please let me know.             As block headers are different in the different Hyperledger platforms, we have to be very careful, either we only describe the common fields of the header or per platform all  fields.  In Fabric the blockheader contains three fields, the block-ID, an integer number staring with 0, a copy of the hash of the previous block (except for block 0) and the hash of the payload of the current block.                     Please add the header fields of Sawtooth, Iroha or Burrows, if you know them. Thanks. Feedback is very welcome.

Needs a grammar check - chiselled, characterictic, virually
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 01:59:53 GMT):<br/>
change to: chiselled, characteristic, virtually incorruptible, block header

<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 02:01:23 GMT):<br/>
tamper resistant vs temper-free
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 07:10:53 GMT):<br/>
@Thaddeus Thanks for your suggestions. You are right with the grammar check. I will make the corrections this afternoon. How about practically temper-resistant?
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 12:42:04 GMT):<br/>
@SjirNijssen that should probably be "virtually tamper resistant" or "for the most part, tamper resistant" or "practically tamper resistant" if you want to keep "practically "
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 12:43:38 GMT):<br/>
@igor-egorov and @KellyCooper I have started reviewing http://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ based on my initial read, I would advise a grammar and term consistency check first, however, I am new to the process. Does this seem like a good first step?
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 12:43:38 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 12:52:15 GMT):<br/>
@Thaddeus Thanks; OK with your proposal, therefore let us agree on practically temper-resistant. I will make the update in the next hour.
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 12:54:23 GMT):<br/>
@Thaddeus While you are going through the Iroha docs, please give some attention to the concepts in Iroha that correspond with concepts on the first concept list of the T & E WG, the one for end users and decision makers. Thanks 
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 13:17:00 GMT):<br/>
@Thaddeus I have updated the concept description of Blockchain according to our communication. Can you agree with the result? If not, please let me know and let us try to get to consensus. I have formulated link in such a way that is not directional as a believe this is of importance. The field in a block previous_hash is simply a copy of the hash of the previous block.

<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Fri, 20 Jul 2018 03:54:49 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:00:11 GMT):<br/>
@Thaddeus I propose that we start with the latest version (2018-07-19-1456) of the concept list (the state) and the three pages of suggestions that you have attached in the chat messag(the proposed transaction) on July 18. 
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:02:52 GMT):<br/>
Hi @SjirNijssen  that sounds good
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:04:07 GMT):<br/>
Let us start with the def of blockchain. Why do we start with the def of blockchain? 
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:04:17 GMT):<br/>
OK, yes
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:05:12 GMT):<br/>
I am sorry, I meant the concept list of the T & E WG and correlate as much as possble with Iroha
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:05:51 GMT):<br/>
That makes sense. I am pulling that up now
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:06:58 GMT):<br/>
Why do we start with the concept blockchain? As this is the concept many people want to understand the Essentials of. Can we agree on that starting point?
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:07:25 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:07:57 GMT):<br/>
Do you have suggestions for the latest version of the concept blockchain?
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:09:16 GMT):<br/>
Can you tell me where to find the most recent version?
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:09:30 GMT):<br/>
yes, in a moment
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:11:01 GMT):<br/>
thank you. I am reading the blockchain definition
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:13:16 GMT):<br/>
This seems logical, straight forward and easy to understand 
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:14:15 GMT):<br/>
I would like to punt in front of the last para of this definition [For software experts only:      and closed after the para with a ].
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:15:54 GMT):<br/>
That sounds good. 
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:16:19 GMT):<br/>
What about those with software experience 
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:16:25 GMT):<br/>
Expert would be your level
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:16:39 GMT):<br/>
Now that we agree on the term blockchain, let us then discuss the concepts block and chain
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:16:55 GMT):<br/>
OK, I am reading these
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:17:15 GMT):<br/>
Would you prefer software experts and people with software experience?
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:17:51 GMT):<br/>
I would say software experience - I can easily understand this but I would not consider myself an expert
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:18:01 GMT):<br/>
As a professor you would be an expert
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:18:18 GMT):<br/>
As someone with CS education I would have experience
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:18:49 GMT):<br/>
ok, let us than modify this to software experience. We then can go to the concept block. 
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:19:07 GMT):<br/>
OK I am reading this now
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:20:26 GMT):<br/>
This is just minor grammar
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:20:32 GMT):<br/>
I would suggest this
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:21:20 GMT):<br/>
A block contains multiple transactions. The data in the block is not encrypted in the blockchain. 
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:21:26 GMT):<br/>
Does that make sense?
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:21:40 GMT):<br/>
Then the rest of the sentences as is
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:22:10 GMT):<br/>
To be precise, a block can also contain one transaction. Do we agree? We could ad: a block usually contains three sections, a blockheader, the payload (with primarily the transaction) and the third section, metadata. 
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:23:15 GMT):<br/>
Hence a block contains one or more transactions, is my proposal.
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:23:28 GMT):<br/>
That is very clear - We could ad: a block usually contains three sections, a blockheader, the payload (with primarily the transaction) and the third section, metadata. 
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:24:03 GMT):<br/>
Or even better: a block contains one and usually more than one transaction. OK?
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:24:18 GMT):<br/>
yes very clear
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:24:40 GMT):<br/>
Do you know what the contents is of an Iroha block?
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:25:06 GMT):<br/>
Not yet. I need to refer back to the docuementation
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:25:10 GMT):<br/>
lets review this
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:25:32 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:25:34 GMT):<br/>
Ok let us do that in anothet session. Let us continue with hash
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:25:50 GMT):<br/>
OK I will make a note of that as a TODO item
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:26:05 GMT):<br/>
excellent

<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:26:21 GMT):<br/>
Hash next or chain?
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:26:47 GMT):<br/>
sorry, you are right, the next is chain
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:27:35 GMT):<br/>
I propose to add: We could ad: a block usually contains three sections, a blockheader, the payload (with primarily the transaction) and the third section, metadata. 
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:28:14 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I would like that addition. The clarity is helpful
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:28:44 GMT):<br/>
In Fabric the blockheader contains three fields: the number of the block, the hash-of-the-previous_block, the data-hash
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:29:02 GMT):<br/>
I will add that addition to the block def
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:29:17 GMT):<br/>
Very helpful.
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:29:31 GMT):<br/>
So the next is hash?
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:29:41 GMT):<br/>
Chain I think.
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:29:53 GMT):<br/>
I have on suggestion for chain.
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:29:56 GMT):<br/>
sorry, you are again right
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:30:00 GMT):<br/>
Last sentence.
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:30:04 GMT):<br/>
I would suggest:
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:30:06 GMT):<br/>
Because of this relationship the term chain is used. This is the basis for the tamper-resistant characteristic of a blockchain. 
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:30:54 GMT):<br/>
I hope we agree that the link is not-directional. 
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:31:13 GMT):<br/>
Yes, does that suggest otherwise?
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:31:15 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I accept your latest suggestion
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:31:34 GMT):<br/>
So the entire definition wold be Each blockheader contains, besides its identifier in the scope of the blockchain, a hash of the data in the block; it also contains a copy of the hash of the previous block. Because of this relationship the term chain is used. This is the basis for the tamper-resistant characteristic of a blockchain. 
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:32:05 GMT):<br/>
Good point. I will update this in the state.
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:32:31 GMT):<br/>
So the next is hash.
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:33:35 GMT):<br/>
I will read that now
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:34:27 GMT):<br/>
A hash of a .... vs. A hash about a....?
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:34:38 GMT):<br/>
In the introduction
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:35:02 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:35:21 GMT):<br/>
Is a hash always a one way function?
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:35:32 GMT):<br/>
Just a question on my part
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:35:43 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that is essential.
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:35:54 GMT):<br/>
so one way function vs function?
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:36:11 GMT):<br/>
one-way
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:37:27 GMT):<br/>
WRT Public blockchain technology. I have come to the conclusion today to introduce another term: Blockchain technology that respects laws and assocciated regulations. What do you think of that?
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:37:52 GMT):<br/>
I will correct hash in the state
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:38:08 GMT):<br/>
Yest that term is useful
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:38:31 GMT):<br/>
I think one work is missing in the following sentence:
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:38:44 GMT):<br/>
It is not possible to reconstruct from the hash [of] the original variable length data field
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:38:47 GMT):<br/>
"of
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:38:50 GMT):<br/>
"of"
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:39:01 GMT):<br/>
I will add that. Thanks for the suggestion.
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:39:14 GMT):<br/>
You are welcome
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:40:21 GMT):<br/>
Can we move to transaction proposal as I will do the updates to the state up till and including Permissioned Blockchain technology tomorrow; it is here now 9 in the evening.
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:40:47 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I will read transaction proposal now
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:42:54 GMT):<br/>
The last sentence of the first para should read: is in most cases the object of  Can you agree? 
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:43:57 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that is valid.
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:44:29 GMT):<br/>
I don't see any additional call-outs that I can see
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:44:39 GMT):<br/>
I propose to add two more illustrations: carTransfer and carColorChange
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:45:59 GMT):<br/>
Can you agree with that proposal?
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:46:02 GMT):<br/>
Yest, important illustrations
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:46:17 GMT):<br/>

Reading transaction now

Suggestion on last sentence first paragraph:
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:48:03 GMT):<br/>
This is [could include] anything, not just monetary assets. or
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:48:12 GMT):<br/>
This is [could regard] anything, not just monetary assets. 
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:48:37 GMT):<br/>
I like the second one. Agreed?
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:49:35 GMT):<br/>
yes agreed, the second is more correct
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:49:57 GMT):<br/>
Let us go to batch
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:50:26 GMT):<br/>

accepted
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:52:36 GMT):<br/>
can we move to state?

yes, reading state
</p>
<p><strong>Thaddeus</strong> (Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:53:50 GMT):<br/>

@Thaddeus There is a new state of the concept list with id 2018-07-22-1228(CET). I have processed the entire list of transactions that we did yesterday. Please have a look and see whether we may conclude we have consensus on this part? Could you also have a look at the first part of the text up til the term Blockchain?
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sun, 22 Jul 2018 11:07:17 GMT):<br/>
Of course every member of the T & E WG is invited to suggest impovements to the current state of the list of concept definitions.

<p><strong>Bobbijn</strong> (Tue, 24 Jul 2018 13:36:42 GMT):<br/>

@KellyCooper, @tkuhrt @Bobbijn I believe we should quote here a part of the charter to avoid possible misunderstanding on an offivally approved and a new charter.

<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Wed, 25 Jul 2018 06:25:46 GMT):<br/>
@Bobbijn @KellyCooper @tkuhrt  I agree with you to leave the first sentence of the charter out. For the remainder it is the same as the charter, except the following: The charter says: It is focussed on, you say: It focusses on. If there is a very good reason, leave it as is (I would say),  else make it as close as possible to the charter.
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Wed, 25 Jul 2018 06:29:05 GMT):<br/>
Is there a reason why (licensed as specified by the Hyperledger Charter) is left out?

Statues update from Thaddeus - I am going to share a gist of revisions with @igor-egorov tomorrow. The changes are grammar and sentence restructuring only. The goal is a more better readability of the concepts. Then, tomorrow, I will focus on the tasks I have assignment myself in the EdX to Github (markdown) initiative
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/training-and-education-wg?msg=DhaW4CJLGHGdYH82e) @SjirNijssen As for learning concepts,  one helpful concept that is lacking in Hyperledger training material is protocol stacks. 
Hi @SjirNijssen, In the edX course, Introduction to Hyperledger,  Only the Iroha project had an architecture stack diagram.  
Others like Fabric and Sawtooth do not present the architectural protocol layers as they were presented in the Iroha section.   
The Iroha stack diagram helped me to quickly get an initial understanding on Iroha architecture.   
Just so you understand what I am talking about, I attached an MS Word document, ProtocolStacks.doc on 3 examples of protocol stacks.   
The first one is the edX course Iroha stack.   
The second one is an example of a Blockchain stack.   
The third one is an old classic computer network protocol stack from the 1990's that helped people understand computer networks and the internet.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/training-and-education-wg?msg=8JnzEDyZZ3fCoLKMR) @rdmross Thank you for bringing to my attention the concept of protocol stack. As I like the principle: do not use a concept, unless you can describe it with examples, I must thank you another time that you attached three examples. You would help me to adopt this principle if I could do the following: suppose that you need to communicate the concept of stack example 2 to a person that has been a software engineer during the last 40 years, but he got an accident last month and now he can temporarily not use his eyes, but his ears are perfect and the background is known. Which facts would you orally  communicate to this person to let him know the contents of the second stack? Thanks for your efforts. Regards

you use PoW because you don't know who are the members of the network, and thus you can't use a classical consensus algorithm from the literature like Paxos, or PBFT

<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Wed, 08 Aug 2018 19:08:34 GMT):<br/>
@paulransfield Paul, I am convinced that the best investement in the knowledge description of Hyperledger platforms is to provide an optimal ratio of declarative and procedural knowledge. Currently I consider the ratio far from optimal. This can best be accomplished, in my experience, by producing separate lists of concepts for the various audiences like end users, decision makers, application and blockchain architects, client application developers, admins, smart contract developers and platform developers.  In the T & E WG we have started with the concept list for end users and decision makers. If we move to the next audience, I believe we have to go first to the different platforms. For practical reasons I have started that work for Fabric. For the Fabric architect my estimate is currently between 75 and 150 concepts. I would welcome your cooperation in speeding up that development. I want to express my bias that I am very focussed on quality of understandable declarative and procedural knowledge. The list for the Fabric platform developers will be according to my current estimate, between 600 and 1000 concepts, and that is a very large number of tightly related concepts.

@paulransfield Thank you for the suggestions. Let us discuss these one by one. First a little addition to the minutes of the last telecon. My estimate was 75 to 150 concepts **for Fabric architects**. I believe that the concept list for end users and decision makers will stabilize  between 30 and 40 concepts; we currently have about 30, and thus we could finish the list of the concepts for the first audience soon.  I propose that we will contantly encourage persons to improve that list. The next list to stabilize is for the Fabric Architect. As said above the numbers are different for the different professional groups.  I believe the most effective way of developing a concept list for an audience is to observe the communication in that audience community. Hence all facts used by that community are facts about certain things or certain names and thus we need a concept description for that thing or name, unless they can be assumed to be known, and for certain verbs in the facts we need to provide the meaning in a concept definition to avoid misunderstandings. That is the protocol we have followed so far. If there is a better one, I would gladly look at it.

By the way, we are working on a second version of the MOOC, most likely launching at the end of October, and it would be really good if we could add a chapter on Burrow. If there is anybody interested in assisting with that, I would be happy to connect with then and discuss about it.

Wrt BFT, my opinion is that end users and decision makers do not discuss the internals of the black box called ordering. That was the reason BFT is not in that list. Wrt Cryptography, I would suggest we may introduce high level definition; what would record mean in this case? Consensus same answer as cryptography. Merkle tree in my opnion definitely not for end users and decison makers. PoW, PoS and PoL same answer as Merkle tree. Block time is a parameter of the ordering service, which is a black boc for end users and decision makers, imho. Node, let us include. Public key and private key, high level, yes. Trust yes and governance yes. Please let me know your opnion.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/training-and-education-wg?msg=qmpHJFADjTmLNcMnC) @paulransfield Paul, I very much welcome your mock-up. May I suggest that you take a look at the section Ledger (it is section 3.9, in chapter 3, Key Concepts of Fabric.) If you look at the third diagram, I believe that is a good start. I have a few suggestions for improvements. I would prefer to have three fields in the header, and not use the directional pointer as this is in my opinion not correct. I further would suggest to use the true id of a block in the chain and that is an integer starting with zero, whether we like that or not is not relevant, it is the truth. I furthermore think that the symbol of transaction should be a rectangle with the right lower corner folded such that there is a clear disctinction between a block represented as a rectangle and a transaction.

<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Thu, 09 Aug 2018 07:01:27 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Thu, 09 Aug 2018 08:04:25 GMT):<br/>
@paulransfield Hi Paul, Once we agree on the contents of a block, I would very much like to make an animation that shows, starting with an empty chain and empty state, how the transactions are processed and appear in a block. I believe that once people understand that clearly, the basis of the data structure aspect of permissioned blockchain is clear and that is a good basis to build up.

Hi Paul, Hyperledger is about blockchain for Enterprise, hence for business, schools, universities, government services. For most if not all of these applications there are regulations about the identities and subject to the laws of the land. According to my judgement  the Anders demo is not in that realm.

I further would suggest to use the true id of a block in the chain and that is an integer starting with zero, whether we like that or not is not relevant, it is the truth. I furthermore think that the symbol of transaction should be a rectangle with the right lower corner folded such that there is a clear disctinction between a block represented as a rectangle and a transaction.*"

Hi @SjirNijssen ... when it comes to marking up an image with a red pen, do you have any preferences to tools ... ideally, we're using a collaborative cloud platform, so others can add there own markups and comments ... i'm happy to use google docs - if it has a dedicated image markup tool ... i recommend a dedicated image markup tool over say a word processor, simply because, its more effective going forward to learn a new tool, than it is to mismatch an existing tool (say a word processor) with an unintended use (eg collaborative image markup, comment, review and sign-off) ...
</p>
<p><strong>paulransfield</strong> (Thu, 09 Aug 2018 21:17:47 GMT):<br/>
with this in mind, i have just signed up to the 'free' cloud platform 'draw.io' ... this integrates schematic diagrams with google drive (and other locations) ... and allows collaborative changes and markups ... https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ToQBfFJbiWlG5dnTBykW84z--3bYsYFO/view?usp=sharing

1.  Google Docs has a 'Draw' package (that sits alongside, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Forms and Google Presentation.
     Google Draw has some, but not all of the drawing tools of 'Draw.io' - which I linked to yesterday.
     Both Google Draw and Draw.io can save working files to Google Drive - which is convenient for collaborative input.
     Draw.io is more like MS Visio, so has all of the shapes you'd need visualising information and workflow processes etc
     For basic schematic drawing, Google Draw is sufficient

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/training-and-education-wg?msg=AtLdkc5RiG5v9erNu)  @SjirNijssen in no particular order, i'll share the following observations re getting the image to its currents discussion draft state:

1.  *Google Docs has a 'Draw' package (that sits alongside, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Forms and Google Presentation).*
     Google Draw has some, but not all of the drawing tools of 'Draw.io' - which I linked to yesterday.
     Both Google Draw and Draw.io can save working files to Google Drive - which is convenient for collaborative input.
     Draw.io is more like MS Visio, so has all of the shapes you'd need for visualising flowcharts, information and workflow processes etc
     For basic schematic drawing, Google Draw is sufficient, but limited - so anticipate augmenting it with standalone graphics applications (Photoshop, Illustrator, Gimp etc)
     Neither Google Draw nor Draw.io had sufficient capabilities to be able to edit and add the folded corners to the bottom right of each of the block's in the image - for these I used the desktop application Adobe Fireworks (now obsolete) 
     This link is to the initial schematic in Google Draw, that you pointed me at - but with no changes https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/11PUPfd1XmpqxynCTEU6rvyXxWd9uWfcl6fl5IzQ14EE/edit?usp=sharing

2. *Google Presentation has basic 'Draw' capabilities for adding images and shapes to a presentation*.
    Google Presentation is similar but not as powerful as common presentation desktop applications like MS PowerPoint, Keynote and OpenOffice Presentation
    Hyperledger has added their default brand graphics and imagery into a Google Presentation file (as is shown in the image below - with the Hyperledger footer)
    I have copy and pasted the sequence of visual changes to the schematic, as I applied them - one per presentation slide
    This link is to the Google Presentation with 4 slides, showing the stages of change for the schematic - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p0eBrkUVmAYaQTlrxxLcxCBLJ6_KZqrPcjZuQcoKWB8/edit?usp=sharing

3.  *Production metrics for collaborative content are emerging*.
    For topic selection for edit and review allow:  15 - 60 min
    For image edit basic allow:  15 - 60 min
    For image edit peer review and sign-off allow:  15 - 60 min

    For list of 30 blockchain core concepts for decision makers and end users allow:  20 - 30 hours of effort minimum (circa 90 hours maximum)

4. *Hyperledger Branding - who determines when it can be applied*.
    I like the Hyperledger Branding elements - but who determines when a change meets the Hyperledger requirements for quality and fit.
    Its easy to imagine changes being released into the wild, with branding, that aren't actually finished

5. *Core Concepts - An essential founding curriculum space*.
    I think 30 blockchain core concepts for decision makers and end users is an essential curriculum topic space.

<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 11 Aug 2018 07:18:50 GMT):<br/>
@paulransfield @KellyCooper Hi Paul and Kelly, Let us carefully consider the options. I would like that we treat this like any other product. Namely start with the requirements of the (end) users. I define end users as people that want to learn the essential knowledge of Enterprise grade blockchain technology, while keeping the ratio between declarative (and usually easier to unsterstand) knowledge (structure) and procedural complexity (process) at a healthy optimum. Hence first focus on the quality of the knowledge. The persons that have to produce the declarative knowledge (structure) and the procedural knowledge (process, animation) should be given the freedom to use tools that best satisfy the requirements of the end users of the educational product. My observation of the various documents was that the optimum ratio as mentioned above is so far not achieved. What is critical? That we recognize that there are several different users classes of people wrt Enterprise grade blockchain. We have at least the following: end users, decision makers, application and blockchain architects, admins, client application developers, smart contract developers and platform developers. I have been working on concept lists for these groups for several months now and the numbers are extremely different. Current estimates: End users 30-40, architects 75-150, platform developers 600-1000. Hence a fundamental decision is that we serve the 7 different classes of users in an optimal way. As you may conclude I focus on quality of knowledge and delivering that knowledge in the best possible way. A do myself not consider an expert in educational technology, but I am amazed at what quality of animation some presenters achieve with pptx and some extensions. I hope this is not forbidden territory. Kelly and Paul, please let me have your thoughts on this. Kind regards   PS Paul, I am happy to come back to your 5 points above, once I have a clearer idea what you and Kelly think about this. 
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 11 Aug 2018 07:28:56 GMT):<br/>
@paulransfield Wrt point 3 above the animation for the 30 (to 40) concepts for end users and decision makers, you say: I expect 20 to 30 hours, and 90 maximum. If 90 would be the guaranteed maximum, I am prepared to assemble of group of people to start on that task. Let us carefully select the tools to do this, with priority on the quality of the end product.

<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 11 Aug 2018 07:57:46 GMT):<br/>
@paulransfield I am a believer in learning by example. I know that in many academic institutions this is not the rule, but our primary mission as T & E WG is to deliver the most effective traning and educational material (of course without any fake knowledge) to the different audiences. Another few rules I have used in my teachings is to give proper attention to the WHY and WHAT it means, and less to syntax. Hence start in the world of the instances, preferably in visual notation that can transformed in textual facts and provide thereafter the needed concept definitions, place the new fact in the context and answer the WHY.
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 11 Aug 2018 07:59:15 GMT):<br/>
@paul I would like that we use the two concepts of block and transaction as an illustration of what we are discussing. Is that ok with you?

Hi @SjirNijssen ... i've updated the block graphic to better reflect your instructions ie transactions have bottom right hand corner folded up; header has room for 3 fields; 

not sure what you want visualised re connecting blocks - is it just the arrow head you want removed from the dotted connecting line

I'd also recommend using Tx1, Tx2 etc instead of T1, T2 as Tx is commonly used for transation

<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 11 Aug 2018 21:27:42 GMT):<br/>
@paulransfield Paul, the fact that tow different fields in two consecutive blocks are equal, means that we should not use an arrow as that suggests a direction or pointer. I welcome your suggestion of Tx1. Thanks for your effort

 Hi @SjirNijssen ... I have added the updated image to the Google Presentation file linked to here:  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p0eBrkUVmAYaQTlrxxLcxCBLJ6_KZqrPcjZuQcoKWB8/edit?usp=sharing

Google Presentation is similar to MS PowerPoint.  Are you able to demonstrate adding text to the last slide - specifically, I'm curious what are the names for the 3 fields in the Header block.  I appreciate you can add the 3 text fields directly into chat - but going forward, we need to be working on both platforms (chat and google presentation) ... let me know if this is not an easy step for you, and we'll discuss other pathways forward

@paulransfield In .../fabric/master/protos/common/ledger.proto the three fields used in the message BlockchainInfo are: height, currentBlockHash and previousBlockHash. In .../protos/common/common.proto#L150 the three fields in the message BlockHeader are number, previous_hash and data_hash. I propose for educational purposes to use the following three field names: blockNumber, previousBlockHash, currentBlockHash. I deliberately exchanged 2 and 3 as this does not result in crossing lines in the diagrams. I am happy to learn to do it myself after I receive the answer to the previous message. If you prefer in the interest of speed to do it, please go ahead.

I've added text to *Public Key*, *Private Key*, and a second paragraph to *Private Data Collections* sections.  Additionally, I've added *Digital Certificate* immediately after Private Key.  I did my best to keep the texts "short and sweet".  Since I'm new to the process, feedback is greatly appreciated.

once audio is added to the animation - you have a video ... TedX recommends 140 words per minute for optimal listenability ... for 5 min x 5 frame video - anticipate a 600 word script ...

</p>
<p><strong>atcvince</strong> (Sun, 12 Aug 2018 20:05:00 GMT):<br/>
Most of the changes are appends
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sun, 12 Aug 2018 20:06:14 GMT):<br/>
@atcvince Vince, I have to go through the proposed changes and I will do that tomorrow morning CET time. I will contact you directly thereafter.
</p>
<p><strong>atcvince</strong> (Sun, 12 Aug 2018 20:09:59 GMT):<br/>
Ok. I tried to keep things short. In my experience working with both management and end user types, the level of attention is inversely proportional to the length of text. It’s a delicate balance...
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sun, 12 Aug 2018 20:13:21 GMT):<br/>
@atcvince I agree that we have to take into account the span of attention. Nevertheless I prefer to provide quality as this is badly needed in the blockchain field, is my opninion. I am happy to look at proposals to shorten the lenght of the concept definitions as long as we do not end up in fake knowledge. My experience is that when one provides crystal clear illustrations, the span of attention is fluid.
</p>
<p><strong>atcvince</strong> (Sun, 12 Aug 2018 20:17:29 GMT):<br/>
I totally understand and agree with your statement @SjirNijssen 
</p>
<p><strong>atcvince</strong> (Sun, 12 Aug 2018 20:23:43 GMT):<br/>

@SjirNijssen ... i've updated the schematic to include Tx for transactions ... i look forward to your thoughts on next steps ...
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Mon, 13 Aug 2018 07:39:46 GMT):<br/>
@paulransfield Thanks for the update. I propose to remove B0, B1, B2 and B3. I propose to remove HO three times from block 0, and put it in one time in accordance with D0 and M0. I propose to replace genenis with "configuration". Genesis is a synynym for the entire first block with blocknumber 0. The three fields of block 0 in the header are: 0 ; - (as there is no previous block), 7a2 (an abbreviation for the 64 charachter, or 7...a2, is that fits). The block with number 0 can be read as follows: The block, identified within the application channel with the name org1org2org3, by the integer 0, has in the field hashPreviousBlock the value null, and has as contents of the third field, hashCurrentBlock the value 7...a2. In the first diagram only this block should be there.  I like the arrangement and renaming of the transactions. The first 10 transactions correspond with the 10 fabcar transaction in BYFN; I have added 2 transactions Tx10 and Tx11 to make the example more realistic. Can we build up the diagramseries in this way step and step and I am prepared to propose a text that can be corrected by you as English native and can be read by you as voice over. Is that acceptable to you Paul?     
</p>
<p><strong>paulransfield</strong> (Mon, 13 Aug 2018 07:50:57 GMT):<br/>
@SjirNijssen ... fantastic ... i'll make the changes tomorrow morning (NZ time) ... yes, as per the animated gif image above, we can build the diagram up as a series, with each subsequent diagram being different from the previous - in accordance with the narrative ... if you can start describing the sequence of images, then I can start mocking it up ... I'm enjoying the process, thanks for being a willing Subject Matter Expert (SME) :)

the Google Presentation tool is one way of the speaker notes being added to the each of the frames in the animated sequence ... I'll look for a 10min YouTube video on how to use Google Presentation - as this is all the training you'll need in the first instance (otherwise I can talk you through it) ...

<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Mon, 13 Aug 2018 08:16:54 GMT):<br/>
To all: please have a look at the latest version of the concept list for end users and decision makers that contains 37 definitions. Thanks to @Thaddeus, @paulransfield  and @atcvince the list has been extended. A point of discussion is whether we have to include in this list the concept of MSP (Membership Service Provider) and then I propose to declare this version 1.0.  I hope also that @tkuhrt and @KellyCooper have the time to take a quick look. After we agree on the contents of 1.0, we earlier have agreed to make a planned step by step move to Github.
</p>
<p><strong>atcvince</strong> (Mon, 13 Aug 2018 11:52:12 GMT):<br/>
Hi @SjirNijssen Thanks for the review & edits. With regards to MSP, perhaps we should go a level higher and talk about Membership instead? Then within the text of Membership we can mention that Fabric handles it via the MSP? Unfortunately, other than ACLs in Composer, I don’t know the other Projects enough to know how they handle Membership within a Network.

<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Mon, 13 Aug 2018 17:48:08 GMT):<br/>
@paulransfield Hi Paul, I propose that we start the animation with a diagram containing an empty blockchain. We do remark that Fabric is so far the only platform that provides several private blockchains (1-1 associated with the concept channel) in one and the same Fabric network. We start the animation for one specific channel, and the contents of the blockchain is empty. Fabric stores in the first block, identified by the number 0 (see the first field in the header), configuration information. The second field in the header is the hash of the previous block; as there is no previous block for block 0, this field is null. The third field contains the hash of the contents of the data section of block 0. As we do not have the space to represent the 64 characters in the diagram, we abbreciate the value of the third field to 7...a2. Hence as we store the first block (block 0), there is no link. In block 1 we see that the data section of the block contains 5 transactions. These 5 transactions are copied from the fabcar example in the Build Your First Network section of the Fabric 1.2 documentation. The first field in the header of block 2 contains the number 1; the second field, hashPreviousBlock contains the value 7...a2. Hence the value of the second field of the header of block 1 is equal to the value of the third field of the header of block 0. The hash of the data section of the block with number 1 (the second block) is b...87. Is this helpful? Paul please feel totally free to correct my Dutch English. I look forward to the work that you planned.

@SjirNijssen ... i've updated the schematic ... please review as not sure about the 7...a2 in B1 ... and have added 7...a2 to legend and not sure if calling it a 64 character hash is correct ... 

i've retained the B0 - B3, but put them above the block ... i've also give a little more room between each block - to support readability ...

for future reference each iteration has taken about 45 minutes to complete ... so its taken us about 2 hours to get to here ... essential time, as this graphic is the basis to your narrative ... now is the time to make any changes - because once we get to video (audio + graphic + sequenced image) ... the time to update is exponentially longer ...

also could you give the entire 64 character string ... we can include it in the image sequence, and its useful to demystify hash strings if we show 0 = 7xosdjla3nllalfjsldfw435g26

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/training-and-education-wg?msg=REAAfZoevYnj93iDE) @paulransfield Hi Paul, This is progress. Please that the green away on the right side of B3. I believe a link symbool (the elements of a traditional chain) would give a better impression than the green dotted line connection. In the animation we should start with block 0 and give all the facts represented in the diagram and where useful some rules that apply.  regards

i've made the animated gif in Adobe Fireworks - which Adobe no longer support or supply ... Adobe Photoshop will create animated gifs, and I expect that Gimp, the open source image editing software, would also do so - but I haven't had to use Gimp for this task ...

For co-design purposes, Google Presentation will allow you to see a frame (or image), and then add the speakers notes to the bottom of the screen ... 

To add audio, we have to use another software product eg Adobe After Effects or Adobe Premier (or open source equivalent) ... and going forward, we can choose to build the video in a cloud platform I like called animatron eg https://www.animatron.com/studio/project/a002405bb722039b5dbedf65

@KellyCooper @Thaddeus I tried to look around for a Docker cheat sheet but the ones I've seen (so far) are a bit dated.  They still show the command *docker run* instead of *docker container run*.  Both commands work, but the latter is more consistent with other Docker commands (e.g. *docker image ...*, *docker network ...*, *docker volume ...*, etc.).  I've reached out to some folks to see if they've come across anything more recent.

Hi @SjirNijssen. If we're unsure about the inclusion of MSP for decision makers / end users, should we go with *Membership Services* instead?  Fabric's Read the Docs page has a good description https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.2/glossary.html#membership-services

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/training-and-education-wg?msg=vXkcYL6Lq4GZhsqX4) @atcvince Hi Vince, Thank you very much for the list. I recollect that we agreed that we make the Architect first platform specific and the first one for Fabric. Is that what you had in mind?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/training-and-education-wg?msg=TqMn9Q6ffY5YcQyjb) @atcvince Hi Vince, I believe it would be clearer if we made a list for the three kinds of administrators in Fabric, namely Network, Channel and Organization. It may happem that some are combined in a practical situation, but it are different resposibilities. What do you think?
</p>
<p><strong>atcvince</strong> (Wed, 15 Aug 2018 13:10:45 GMT):<br/>
Hi @SjirNijssen agree on making architect/consultant section platform specific. Specifically for Fabric, I also agree on creating subsections. Additionally, should Ordering Service be a separate section or will it be part of Network or Channel?
</p>
<p><strong>atcvince</strong> (Wed, 15 Aug 2018 13:27:56 GMT):<br/>
With regards to the list I sent, I started with Fabric’s Glossary, and then later mixed in other items (e.g. consensus mechanisms of other projects). Can separate the non-Fabric items later today (when I’m off work)

Thanks. I see Tracy's notes and they make sense. My use case was based on the path of least resistance and informed by the way new users can commit to the W3C COGA repository, however, in that repo there are only a very limited number of extremely vetted contributors. I will update the doc.

Hi @SjirNijssen I was wondering if the administration of the Ordering Service falls under the scope of Network administrator or if it should have its own...

My proposal would be to use many more intermediate diagrams as I believe people much easier remember diagrams than tekst. What do you think? If it helps, I could make the tekst associated with the first say 10 diagrams.

@SjirNijssen ... thanks for your prompt and considered response ... I appreciate we are moving at pace with the mockup's and have in this one iteration moved from sequenced image to video ...

i agree with you ... keep chunking the graphic down into usefully small chunks of knowledge/information ... and standardise the chunk size, so that the audience gets used to being able to consume the chunk ... thats why I mentioned the 2 minute twitter video chunk of 300 words ... so, maybe that's a guide to the number of images we require - ie rather than saying we need another 10, could we say we need another 10 x 300 word narratives to support the 10 diagrams?

no rush to reply ... but I'm enjoying the process :)

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/training-and-education-wg?msg=TvZ94aGeXGcA6GKFp) @paulransfield Please keep devices in mind. Many will view, especially internationally, on their mobile. Can the 'guy' fade out and the graphic cover most of the screen for most of the video? Screen real estate on bottom third and right quarter can be the blockchain image. Whether with a fade or zoom. Or, see how this plays on your mobile and determine if the graphic readability is prominent. Great work all. Thanks, Kelly

@KellyCooper  ... thanks for your feedback ... i agree that the space to the right hand side of the video window, where the claymation technician is standing, could be used for the whiteboard to expand into ... generally, the first 5 to 10 seconds, allows for the presenter to introduce themselves, and then they can fade away, and the whiteboard can scale to full screen ...

i've testing this layout in my workplace where mobile user base is front and foremost, but i've retested by downloading the video from chat, and uploading into twitter ... the audio works, and the graphics are too small - but without the narrative or spoken word audio, its difficult to generalise about the size of the graphics ... but going forward, optimising readability for mobile is a peer review consideration ...

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/training-and-education-wg?msg=eEyxN9fm7sHvFYRsD) @paulransfield Looks great. The details in the graphic are so good I want to see them more closely. I wonder if it makes sense to end with something like a 'link' that encircles the first section and allows viewers to opt to a second video that is a closeup in of that section, and through the next sections one at a time. The first, then, would have him offering the graphic, the next ones are the details of each section. The same voice could continue. Okay Paul, everyone is a 'movie critic' so feel free to ignore this post. It could be a different approach works well for closeups :)

Hi all. In classes/meetups I’ve attended, there’s some confusion regarding Fabric’s *execute-order-validate* architecture. Not sure if it’s already planned for, but a video showing the flow of a sample transaction could be very helpful.

In my opinion it is clearly described in v1.2 docs chapter three , section from 3.7.7 onwards till the end of 3.7.  It has been there, I guess, since end of March 2018. Regards

Hi @SjirNijssen @KellyCooper, @atcvince ... thanks for the prompt feedback ... and I'm pleased to report back, that everything suggested can be implemented ...

just to reaffirm, *concurrent* to the work on the prioritised list of terms required to understand hyperledgers blockchain stack ... a group of us, will mockup templates for animating the static visual content required ... with the initial focus being 'agnostic permissioned blockchain' and 'transaction' ...

thanks to @SjirNijssen's willingness to share - and the range of visualisation technologies available , we are *rapidly* unfolding a process ... which highlights several of the known content production bottlenecks ...

if as we'd like to see, more video's produced at pace ... then, I'd suggest drafting and tabling your 300 word scripts earlier rather later ... as these, inform the graphics to be used - which take time to mould and fold ...

Hi @SjirNijssen @KellyCooper, @atcvince ... thanks for the prompt feedback ... and I'm pleased to report back, that everything suggested can be implemented ...

just to reaffirm, *concurrent* to the work on the prioritised list of terms required to understand hyperledgers blockchain stack ... a group of us, will mockup templates for animating the static visual content required ... with the initial focus being 'agnostic permissioned blockchain' and 'transaction' ...

thanks to @SjirNijssen's willingness to share - and the range of visualisation technologies available , we are *rapidly* unfolding a process ... which highlights several of the known content production bottlenecks ...

if as we'd like to see, more video's produced at pace ... then, I'd suggest drafting and tabling your 300 word scripts earlier rather later ... as these, inform the graphics to be used - which take time to mould and fold ...

so, in a nutshell, don't wait for the ideal list of prioritised terms to be generated, before writing and peer reviewing the associated scripts ...

To all members of the T & E WG: I propose not to include MSP in the concept list for end users and decision makers and declare the current list v1.0. Reason: it is obvious that membership somehow must be managed in a block box for end users and decision makers. Please let me know your reactions to this proposal. 
</p>
<p><strong>atcvince</strong> (Sun, 19 Aug 2018 00:46:36 GMT):<br/>
Hi @SjirNijssen I’m okay with the proposal.
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sun, 19 Aug 2018 08:19:23 GMT):<br/>
@atcvince Hi Vince, Wrt to your proposed list of concepts for Fabric architects. I believe it is essential that we know which tasks a Fabric Architect has to perform. That makes a clear list of white and black boxes and then we have a rule to guide us in the selection process. In my view the Fabric architect is the direct contact between the business decision makers and other professionals, later in the development process such as admins, application developers and smart contract developers. Do we agree on that point of view? If yes, then your proposal for the concept "Use case" for Fabric architect is agreed. I believe another aspect of that job is to be able to design the network, the channels, the private data collections and the endorsement policies. Let me pause here and invite every member of the WG to give his considerations on this message. 
</p>
<p><strong>atcvince</strong> (Sun, 19 Aug 2018 20:52:09 GMT):<br/>
Hi @SjirNijssen Yes, we agree with the point of view. It would be helpful if the Architect role is clearly defined in terms of responsibilities as well as expected deliverables (with other roles to follow). I look forward to hearing the feedback from the other Members of the WG. 
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Mon, 20 Aug 2018 13:32:16 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/training-and-education-wg?msg=iMylUQNxTKYBt9l6t0) @atcvince The Fabric architect is the intermediary between the mgt of an org and the admins, the client devs and smart contract devs. He/she needs to have a good understanding of the Fabric elements and their interaction. Hence he needs to be able to speak the language of the mgt of the org as well as the language used by the adminsm client app devs and smart contract devs. What do you think of this view? Of course all members of the T & E WG are invited to bring in their view.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/training-and-education-wg?msg=vQCcMZPTR30It4OiYX) @atcvince That is good to read. Let us apply progressive disclosure. In my view the Fabric architect must be able to design the network, with the consortia, the orgs, the channels, the peers, the orderers. He/she also must be able to specify the policies.

So far I have used the term Signed Agreement on Fabric Cooperation (signed by all the orgs involved)  to include the output of the decision makers of the various orgs involved. Maybe you have a proposal for a better term for that concept, which has so far got very little attention in the Fabric community. The term Signed Agreement on fabric Cooperation is not holy at all, the concept behind it is. Your thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>atcvince</strong> (Tue, 21 Aug 2018 17:55:05 GMT):<br/>
Hi @SjirNijssen Throughout my SAP career, we’ve used terms like “Project Blueprint” and “Design Document” to describe the same document. Not sure if these are better terms but what’s essential is that once the document is approved, any deviation should be subject to an established change control procedure.

<p><strong>atcvince</strong> (Wed, 22 Aug 2018 13:04:38 GMT):<br/>
Hi @SjirNijssen in my experience the blueprint/design are signed agreements and establish the baseline scope of the project. Any deviation is recorded as a change request

Thanks, @KellyCooper. I just made it through my backlog of messages on this channel. @atcvince @nathalie-ckc @Thaddeus : I want to thank you all for the work that you have been putting into converting the EdX course content into Markdown files. We did lock down a bit on the "write" access to the education repo. We want to be sure that people are using forks of the repositories and pull requests for changes made. This way, we can review it and catch any formatting issues before the changes get put in place. The other thing that normally throws people off if they use the Github UI directly to edit files is that they fail to include the appropriate DCO sign-off lines. Since Hyperledger's charter requires that all contributions have DCO signoffs, it is important step. This step is normally not simple with the Github UI, but from the command line, the -s option of git commit will add those details for you. I hope the Gist that Kelly refers to will provide some good information to help others contribute. If you have questions or suggestions to improve the Gist, please let me know.

<p><strong>atcvince</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 02:58:40 GMT):<br/>
Hi @tkuhrt with regards to the Gist itself, my feedback (as a new GitHub User) is as follows:
1. Before being able to use the *git config* commands, I had to go into the *education* directory.  So should Steps #4 & #5 be swapped?
2. Probably need to mention that values for the *git config* commands should be included in quotes (e.g. git config user.name "atc-vince")
3. Before I could push my changes, I had to execute a *git remote add* command (i.e. git remote add atc-vince <cloned repo>).  Should a step be added to the Gist?
4. In Step 11, we could add text saying that the User needs to click on the "Pull Requests" tab in order to see the "New Pull Request" button
5. Should the Gist include a step showing the User how to *squash* commits?  I did it using *git rebase -i HEAD~<# of commits>*
 
</p>
<p><strong>atcvince</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 03:14:57 GMT):<br/>
@SjirNijssen perhaps it could be a combination of both?  Inter-Org because agreements involve various legal entities and system integrator(s).  Intra-Org because there are processes agreed upon between units within the same entity.  Thoughts?

<p><strong>atcvince</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 14:54:09 GMT):<br/>
@SjirNijssen Hi Sjir, I agree. Inter-Org agreements should be legally binding. As for Intra-Org, it doesn’t have to be because disputes are typically handled “in house”. @SjirNijssen [ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/training-and-education-wg?msg=Gnez9qaGECE2Chvsw)

<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:37:26 GMT):<br/>
@atcvince  Now that we agree on the true nature of the inter-org agreement, my statement is that this inter-org agreement is the basis for further design of the network, the specification of the policies and development of the client application and the smart contract, and each design, specification and development artefact nees to be justified in terms of the inter-org agreement. Can we agree on that?  
</p>
<p><strong>atcvince</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 20:11:50 GMT):<br/>
@SjirNijssen If the specification of policies includes how parties join/leave the network, endorsements, etc., then I am in agreement.

List of concepts for the audience Fabric Architect. Here is a first increment for a list of concepts for a Fabric Architect, having reached agreement on the interpretation of certain concepts during this week. This list includes all the concepts of the concept list for end users and decision makers. Instead of listing the concepts in isolation, we start with the major associations between the concepts are listed hereaftermakers. Instead of listing the Network, contains at least one consortium and at least one organization. A network contains at least one application channel and exactly one ordering (system) channel. Each organization as member of a channel has either at least one client application, or  Awone or more peers, or one or more ordering nodes, and at least one admin. Each organization in a channel with peers has at least one peer on the channel as a leading peer. Each organization with peers on a channel has to assign a peer as static or dynamic. At least one of the organizations on a channel has a anchor peer for that channel.  A Fabric network can assign an ordering system to a channel.

@SjirNijssen Hi Sjir, I agree with all points. I also agree with the approach of painting the big picture before getting into individual concepts. 
I did something similar at a recent Meetup... started by talking about network components (e.g. network, nodes, channels, etc.), followed by a sample transaction flow, and then a deeper dive into components (e.g. MSP). Thankfully, Fabric’s Read the Docs page provides some excellent graphics.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/training-and-education-wg?msg=AgIiOWM4ij4v0y7lJs) @atcvince Hi Vince, This is a good step forward. We agree that the Architect has to be able to specify the configuration of the Network. Let us also agree that the architect has to justify every decision of the design with reference to the elements in the Inter-org Agreement for Fabric Cooperation. This brings me to another major area of concepts that the Fabric architect needs to master, namely all the policies. Many of the policies will already have been formulated in the Inter-org Agreement, but they need to be translated in Fabric-Latin. Can we agree on that extension of the task of the Fabric Architect?

@yacovm   Gossip
In section 2.4.9 of the chapter Concepts in the latest version of the Fabric docs (approved for inclusion 2018-08-03) (https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/hyperledger-fabric/latest/hyperledger-fabric.pdf) I read:  
“• Leader peer. When an organization has multiple peers in a channel, a leader peer is a node which takes responsibility for distributing transactions from the orderer to the other committing peers in the organization. A peer can choose to participate in static or dynamic leadership selection.

It is helpful, therefore to think of two sets of peers from leadership perspective – those that have static leader selection, and those with dynamic leader selection. For the static set, zero or more peers can be configured as leaders. For the dynamic set, one peer will be elected leader by the set. Moreover, in the dynamic set, if a leader peer fails, then the remaining peers will re-elect a leader.

It means that an organization’s peers can have one or more leaders connected to the ordering service. This can help to improve resilience and scalability in large networks which process high volumes of transactions.”

It is helpful, therefore to think of two sets of peers from leadership perspective – those that have static leader selection, and those with dynamic leader selection. For the static set, zero or more peers can be configured as leaders. For the dynamic set, one peer will be elected leader by the set. Moreover, in the dynamic set, if a leader peer fails, then the remaining peers will re-elect a leader.

Suppose an org has 5 peers, all joined to channel1, with 2 peers dynamic and 3 peers static. One of the static peers is assigned by the admin to be leader. However the dynamic subset also selects a leader. What happens when the statically selected leader disagrees with the dynamically elected leader? 

If any of the assumptions are wrong, please point out. 

</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 10:15:12 GMT):<br/>
there is no disagreement or anything
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 10:15:18 GMT):<br/>
you may use leader election or not
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 10:15:39 GMT):<br/>
if you don't use it - (meaning - "static") then the peer ignores the entire leader election messages
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/training-and-education-wg?msg=PKZCP8EJt4ogpcNCn) @yacovm Could you please answer the question: What happens when the statically selected leader disagrees with the dynamically elected leader?

@yacovm  I believe we two have a different interpretation of the following text in the docs section 2.4.9: " It is helpful, therefore to think of two sets of peers from leadership perspective – those that have static leader selection, and those with dynamic leader selection. " Does this imply that for a set of peers of an org joined to a channel, they all must either have static or dynamic operation mode?

@yacovm Thank you for the reference. My conclusion based on your answer above is that a set of peers of a given org1 joined to channel2 can have two subsets, one having only static and the other one having only dynamic operation mode selection.

@yacovm  Above you say: Does this imply that for a set of peers of an org joined to a specific channel, they all must either have static or dynamic operation mode? Your answer was clear:
no... you can have mixed groups   Hence we have now clarity of the fact that the set of peers joined to a given channel can have some peers with operation mode Static and the others in that set with operation mode Dynamic. Now my question differently expressed: How to avoid that a non leader receives twice the same block, one from the static leader and one from the dynamic leader? And what to do if these blocks are different?

<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 12:02:37 GMT):<br/>

the blocks should be identical under the assumption the orderer is honest
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 12:04:05 GMT):<br/>
Fabric block gossip works in a 2 independent process - 
- Push: You (a peer) select a random set of peers and send them the block you receive for the first time
- Pull: You (a peer) select a random set of peers and exchange data digests and if the peers have blocks that you don't have, they send them to you
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 12:04:25 GMT):<br/>
the first process (push) means there is always a chance you will receive a block more than once
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 12:04:35 GMT):<br/>
even if there is a single leader
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 12:05:39 GMT):<br/>
it's not as efficient as can be, but it reduces latency
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 12:10:37 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm Thanks very much for your help. I will propose in the Fabric Doc WG that we will include a separate topic of Gossip in the Concepts chapter of the Fabric docs as I believe it is worth it to be described in a way that people easily understand and have it consistent throughout the entire documenation . I will start thinking about that topic. My first idea is to build it on top a few typical scenario's and then draw general conclusions. Other suggestions? Once again many thanks   
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 12:12:11 GMT):<br/>
suggestions - tell people to always use anchor peers if they want multi-organizational endorsements to work starting from v1.2 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 12:12:43 GMT):<br/>
because in v1.2 , SDKs use service discovery and if you have an endorsement policy in which you need to reach out to peers in other organizations than your own....
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 12:12:49 GMT):<br/>
without anchor peers you're going to have problems
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 12:13:01 GMT):<br/>
because the peers won't be able to compute the discovery responses
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 12:13:02 GMT):<br/>
You mean anchor peer for each org-channel combination
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 12:13:27 GMT):<br/>
I always talk in the scope of some channel, unless I  explicitly state it :) 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 12:13:39 GMT):<br/>
you need at least 1 reachable anchor peer in a channel
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 12:13:47 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm great!
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 12:13:57 GMT):<br/>
for high availability, obviously it makes sense to have APs for each org
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 12:15:59 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm  You say: I always talk in the scope of some channel, unless I explicitly state it. I think we have to make this much clearer in the docs.
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 12:19:01 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm You say above: for high availability, obviously it makes sense to have APs for each org. My question: why did Fabric not make this a requiment instead of an advice? I like to understand the WHY. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 12:31:56 GMT):<br/>
why would you make something that isn't a requirement, a requirement? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 12:32:14 GMT):<br/>
also you can't enforce it technically
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 12:32:18 GMT):<br/>
but that's another story
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 18:05:43 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm Are there papers that describe why it can't be technically enforced?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 18:16:47 GMT):<br/>
it can't be enforced simply because each organization needs to update the anchor peer on its own. 
There is no way to enforce this because at first you don't have any anchor peers at all. 
Then, each organization - adds its own anchor peers.
To enforce something you need to prevent some action from happening, right? How can you enforce such a thing?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/training-and-education-wg?msg=vGxXyXjDDtje7c4YY) @yacovm My understanding of the latest version of the Network topic wrt anchor peer is that for each channel there needs to be at least one anchor peer in one of the orgs of that channel. Is that a wrong conclusion? How could it be enforced? Before the configuration of the channel is approved by Fabric, is it not possible to issue a message that there needs to be at least one anchor, in any of the orgs of the channel?

@yacovm I need more time to reflect on this before I can answer your last question. We are goning into true fundamental territoty. I am somewhat surprised to learn today that the admin of one org can do such damage to all the orgs in a channel. I believe one of the real interesting aspects of Fabric is its focus on cooperation of various orgs. I believe that the majority of people involved in a cooperation accept that once the cooperation has started, it needs to be made not too easy for one pilot to let the plane go down.

I said it can change the anchor peers of its own organization
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 20:10:44 GMT):<br/>
not for other organizations....
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 20:13:04 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm Yes, that is what I understood. However once 4 orgs agree in writing to start a Fabric cooperation, there are rights and duties. An org could have the right to leave the network, but not the unrestricted right to cause damage such as making the channel non operational, would ne my proposal.
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 20:13:22 GMT):<br/>
who said the channel is non operational?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 20:13:43 GMT):<br/>
you realize that if you leave the network - it means your anchor peers are also gone, right?
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 20:14:45 GMT):<br/>
You criticize that an organization can delete its own anchor peer(s) but you're fine with it leaving the channel? :thinking: 
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 20:18:10 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm yes, I do realize that. I believe it would be a good step forward to consider in a future release that there is a balance of rights and duties. And it is quite possible to write into the Original agreement on cooperation that leaving is associated with a certain penalty. Happens quite often today in other areas.  New question: If an org has no anchor peer, is it not the case that the peers of that org are not any longer addressable? 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 20:20:12 GMT):<br/>
Regarding the new question - no. Because its peers can be discovered via other anchor peers.
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 20:23:41 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm Excuse me for not remembering a few minutes ago that you have said that before. My real concern is this: why should the last org that has a anchor on the channel be permitted to withdraw that? The org should have an obligation to make it not a single point of failure, I would prefer. 
</p>
<p><strong>yacovm</strong> (Sun, 26 Aug 2018 20:28:20 GMT):<br/>
Recall that anchor peers are only used for peers that are brought up after a restart or new ones, to discover the already running peers in the channel. 
We want several anchor peers, preferable from different organizations, in case something bad happens to the anchor peers, or to the network reachability to the organizations that the anchor peers hail from.
> why should the last org that has a anchor on the channel be permitted to withdraw that?
1) If that's the last organization that has anchor peers, then it means the other organizations didn't want to contribute to the availability of the peer membership of the channel, and therefore they deserve to be punished for their incompetence.
2) "The smallest minority on earth is the individual. Those who deny individual rights cannot claim to be defenders of minorities" ;)

@yacovm This is a very fruitful exchange of ideas. Let me give you my provisional and not well thought through conclusion: Fabric has a fairly powerful endorsement policy that with a small extension, could be used to set up very powerful cooperations, in which it is possible to specify points on the whole spectrum from unanimity to a lot of power to the individual, as long as every point on that spectrum can be formulated in Fabric. I regret that I have to go to bed as I need quite some sleep every day. Thank you very much for the time today. I will tomorrow go over the entire discussion again before contacting you. I have to integrate that knowledge before I can make a sensible step forward.

<p><strong>atcvince</strong> (Mon, 27 Aug 2018 17:59:39 GMT):<br/>
@KellyCooper @tkuhrt if we were to ask the various meetups to start sending us copies of their slide decks, where would we store them? Also spoke with David and he would appreciate some assistance from our WG to update some of the presentations. For example, the original one for fabric still references v1.0
</p>

<p><strong>atcvince</strong> (Mon, 27 Aug 2018 18:46:50 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt to confirm, we’ll use the wiki as a “library” of slide decks used by various meetups?
</p>
<p><strong>atcvince</strong> (Mon, 27 Aug 2018 18:51:06 GMT):<br/>
I’m thinking about structure... do we attach files according to some sort of metadata (e.g. framework, topic, etc.), or by the Meetup’s location, or something else...

@tkuhrt Hi Tracy, during this morning’s meeting it was mentioned that 4/9 sections of LFS171x still requires work. Since I’ll be working on it (to incorporate Chapter 3 comments), perhaps I can help work on those as well...

@KellyCooper :  I understand that you are working on animation elements.  Could you give me more detail about that project?   Also, The other projects I have listed, Visual Dictionary and Chain Go and Java came from the April/May sprint Google spreadsheet that may be out of date.   Are you still working on those projects?  If you are, I would like some update details on them.   Are there any other project you are currently working on?
</p>
<p><strong>rdmross</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 01:17:22 GMT):<br/>
@SjirNijssen:   Except for the Core Concepts that you are currently working on, I have listed 2 other projects you were involved in.  One iv the Visual vocabulary in Ledger topic I got from the April/May sprint Google spreadsheet.  Are you still working on that?   Also during the meeting on June 4, you and Collin showed a presentation about fabric.  Are there any other projects you are working on.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/training-and-education-wg?msg=Qq7En8szEkjTwCArT) @rdmross I have started work on the concept list for Fabric architects. This is a much larger list than the list for end users and decision makers. De visual vocabulary is part of a longer term project to produce an effective "traffic sign" language for parts of Fabric.  The animation of the lifecycle of a transaction will get an update by end of september as there will be available in 1.3 a new interesting functionality.

I set up a link to GoogleDocs to begin the Fabric Concepts Project, rather than use the wiki at this point. It is simpler to work where it's easy to see typos, misspelled words and offer comments. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wyof9LPokZymvTj6Cbc_3tz39pKi7ZHHUW_6KQlVDIk/edit?usp=sharing

<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 01:41:50 GMT):<br/>
@atcvince : sorry for my delay in responding. My thought was that we could attach the presentations to a Wiki page, and then provide a structure that people would be able to locate the presentations that they want. Maybe something that was Blockchain Introductory material and then a separate section for each of the projects. As needed, we could add more categorization. Obviously searching might become an issue, but if the titles of the presentations are descriptive enough, people should be able to find it. See existing https://wiki.hyperledger.org/community/presentations page for possible structure. Maybe we just add to that page.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 01:43:30 GMT):<br/>
@atcvince : Any of the sections that do not have an assignee are open to be chosen. https://github.com/hyperledger/education/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aedx-migration -- it looks like maybe two do not have assignees. @Thaddeus @nathalie-ckc : Can you confirm that you are still working on the issues that are assigned to you?

I'm  glad the subject of increasing member engagement came up.
As I listened to what to do to increase engagemen, I saw what I can do to 
the current projects list to do this.
Modifications include:
	-For each project status, a link to a help wanted list including skills required and how to apply.
	-Expand contribution opportunities to non-project items sush as helping students on exd.
	-Include a priority sorted backlog to do list.
As I said in the last meeting, I want to slowly morph this current project list into a simple, easy to use project management tool.
For now, I want feedback on what I said here and also for each project leader to send me their help wanted list with skills required (such as able to use github).  
Send any feedback or help wanted information to r@uar.biz or reply here.

In the meeting we discussed how to get multiple people to be able to view for currency of material, not for markdown. @tkuhrt will you allow Thaddeus to the issue. Thaddeus, Tracy and I are unaware of the other person and she is reaching out. We decided, too that in Google Docs we can have a subgroup who want to review each chapter.  I'm working on meeting minutes now, we discussed this at length. Please give us today to get it sorted out. Thanks, Kelly

He mentioned that he did not have time, so I assumed it was open for anyone. Thus, I mentioned @nathalie-ckc as someone who had expressed an interest. If you have already started the issue, please feel free to complete it. I will assign it to you.

Hey, @Thaddeus : It looks like your PRs are still missing the sign-off. You will need to do step 10 in https://gist.github.com/tkuhrt/10211ae0a26a91a8c030d00344f7d11b to correct this. It will be important to do the interactive rebase and squash the commits into one. When it asks you for the log message, it will be important to include a signed off line. Something like
> Signed-off-by: Thaddeus Cambron your-email@example.com

Replacing the `your-email@example.com` with whatever email you use for Github.

<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Mon, 24 Sep 2018 19:44:09 GMT):<br/>
@OlgaLarsen @Bobbijn Thank you for helping as a tech writer with the concept list for the audience end users and decision makers. On the basis of observation of many chat messages my conclusion is that a concept list for an unspecified audience results in an imprecise and an insuffiently consistent set of  concecpt definitions. As there are several different audiences involved, end user and decision makers, blockchain architects, blockchain admins, client app developers, smart contract developers and platform developers, we have so far asked ourselves the question: what does the end user and decision maker audience need to know to be able to do their job in a blockchain based system specification, development, deployment and maintenance. Originally the idea was to have one Hyperledger concept list for each audience, independent of the platform and provide special notes for each platform that has a deviation from the general definition. Looking at the questions in the chat channels, I wonder whether that is the most productive approach. My analytics processor comes to the conclusion that the vast majority of questions have to do with a specific platform. It is also objective observation that Fabric has the largest amount of questions. What do you think of the idea to specialize the list we now have for each of the 5 platforms, with Fabric as the first one to be delivered? @KellyCooper 
</p>
<p><strong>atcvince</strong> (Mon, 24 Sep 2018 20:15:16 GMT):<br/>
@SjirNijssen I can “shadow” the work being done in Fabric, and work on drafts for Sawtooth. CC: @KellyCooper 
</p>
<p><strong>OlgaLarsen</strong> (Mon, 24 Sep 2018 20:21:29 GMT):<br/>
@SjirNijssen My pleasure. :)  I've just added the governance piece. Have a look. As for the Users: There is a big difference between the very-end-users, corporate decision-makers and the technical teams (admins, etc.). I would probably give an overview of the technology and describe the benefits and some glossary, BUT split the "usability" part into 2 pieces: 1. For non-technical end-users - explain how exactly they are going to be using the system (steps, which applications, etc.) 2. For Technical Users (admins, system engineers, etc.) - what apps are available, what are the technical best practices, systems diagrams, etc.  Just a thought...
</p>
<p><strong>OlgaLarsen</strong> (Mon, 24 Sep 2018 20:37:17 GMT):<br/>
@SjirNijssen And for the technical crowd we can provide notes per platform and application. Maybe even setup a standard table and ask SMEs from each area for an input.

@OlgaLarsen Do I understand correctly that you are in favour of having end users as a specific audience as well as decision makers? There is in my opinion a substantial overlap in concepts relevant to end users and decision makers, or more precise, the set of concepts for end users is a proper subset of the set of concepts for decision makers. What do you think?

<p><strong>OlgaLarsen</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 14:32:52 GMT):<br/>
You are right - there is a lot of overlap, so I was thinking not separating them, but maybe adding extra info for decision-makers. Because in addition to the end-user info (how to use the system, what is the difference from the processes that they are used to, etc.) the decision-makers should be concerned about the important questions such as: what will be the cost to deploy it and maintain it. They think mostly in hardware / licenses / resources costs. So I think maybe it's a good idea to show a diagram for a simple network (infrastructure) so they can get an idea. Let me know your thoughts.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/training-and-education-wg?msg=phtS8Tv5vtY7GtPXX) Anything that we do for platform specific concepts should be considered information that should be added to the documentation for those particular projects. This would require going through the normal contribution process for those projects.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 16:22:33 GMT):<br/>
If necessary, we should enter "feature requests" for expanding the documentation in areas where we feel the current documentation is lacking, and then feel free to address that feature request.

I just saw it when I wanted to go to bed, so I studied the film twice and try to make notes. I hope we take the time to increase the quality of the contents and the clarity of the communication. In general I would like to reduce the speed and add a few more words wrt the state, key and validity of a tx. Nice step forward. Let us not rush, but spent sufficient time to have a high quality product. The bridgehead is there, now pause and figure out to have top quality of contents. I glad to help with that.

Fabric 1.4 is in the wings too, with significant change. In the working group meeting we try to discuss priorities. Separately, we encourage participants to draft content or outlines to build from. I encourage an outline or list of areas to address so that we focus on particulars rather than discuss the challenges. Simply because there are so many challenges we can get distracted to the point of lower productivity.

In the T & E WG we started with an audience specific concept list. There after we add an audience specific data field list. Thereafter three more constructs are needed and you have a knowledge structure from which the sequence of presentation can be derived. This is what is currently missing in the popular tools. @KellyCooper

I changed the link in the main wiki under Current Contribution Needs
to the google sheet version.  I will be deleting the old page later.
The google sheet version is much easier to modify.
No markup skills are needed. It's just a matter of just typing what you need.
Because of that, I will no longer be updating the content.
I am still looking for ideas of improvement and will do what it takes to make it better.
Don't limit ideas to just google sheets.
With the increased activity and complexity of project needs, google sheets may not be the best tool.
We may be ready for some simple to use project management tool.
I will be more than eager to contribute to this area in any way.

The article contains many true assertions, but another fact is that it contains also a few seriously  untrue assertions. If you are interested we could discuss this here. I continue to stress that we need to move the balance between quatity and quality somewhat and give more attention to the quality of the knowledge that we as a WG will make available.

However, the translation of this article was published in what you could call the Dutch Wall Street Journal or the Dutch Financial Times. Their readership does not consist of top blockchain experts. But many of them have the power to decide to try out or block a new technology. I consider this irresponsible of the editorial staff just as I consider it irresposible that a professor has written this. Do you think my assessment is too harsh or can you agree with my assessment?  Would I have been a member of the editorial staff, I would have voted for the title: The Big Crypto Blockchain Lie.

@SjirNijssen To me, Decision Makers, for the most part, will not make the choice of exploring blockchain technology solely based on a single person’s opinion (for or against). In the meantime, we do what we can with what we’ve got.
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 20 Oct 2018 16:37:49 GMT):<br/>
@yacovm @atcvince @KellyCooper I propose that the T & E WG will work on an article, based on the concept list for end users produced in the past months and makes it clear in laylanguage that there is a vast difference (in terms of effects for society) between trustless and trustful blockchain technology, and a smaller common technical aspect. 
</p>

<p><strong>atcvince</strong> (Sat, 20 Oct 2018 16:46:56 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Sat, 20 Oct 2018 16:59:40 GMT):<br/>
@yacov @atcvince @KellyCooper  I propose that the article is based on the characteristics of immutability of recorded data (not limited to assets) and its consequences for a democratic society, on the new possibilites of faster and regulated (agreed by the parties directly involved) cooperation between organizations and individuals as a next step in the development of a more democratic society. Please feel invited to be critical on these two aspects and if you believe we need to include more aspects, I welcome to read them here. How immutability and new forms of cooperation is realized is a technical implementation aspect that may change over time, is my belief.

@SjirNijssen The article is clearly quite biased. I agree that your title "The Big Crypto Blockchain Lie" would've made better sense, but the author did include a small paragraph about enterprise DLTs and he couldn't have been more wrong there as well. Agree with @atcvince that focus should be on portraying Blockchain as more than just cryptocurrencies, with a major emphasis going to the Enterprise DLT aspect. Exactly how the enterprise application of blockchain (especially hyperledger) is advantageous should be explored

@KellyCooper @atcvince @yacovm @ikocsis @tkuhrt @DavidBoswell @tahaf10 @OlgaLarsen @Thaddeus @paulransfield @Bobbijn and all other members of the T & E WG. Thank you for all the suggestions. As a result I propose to focus on the following 5 related topics 1. blockchain for law abiding applications  2. immutable facts, rules and concept definitions (hence move away from the narrow asset concept)  3. direct inter-enterprise cooperation as an extension of intra-Enterprise cooperation (which has been developed during the last three centuries) 4. digital identities 5. no single point of failure, and the associated conceptual view of the current implementation technology. Please let me know whether you agree or want to include further topics. I still believe that the set of basic and supporting concepts is already for the most part available in the existing concept list for end users and decision makers. The proposal is to add a readable text such that intelligent laypeople can easily understand the contents and extend this with an interactive component. Please let the channel members know what you think about this proposal.

<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Sun, 21 Oct 2018 20:03:04 GMT):<br/>
This article is really surprising and disheartening, especially so that Roubini is so high-profile (even I, a layman in economics, recognize his name)... The paper bends quite a few facts to serve its underlying agenda and is flat-out factually wrong on most points for consortial blockchains/DLTs. I support Sjir's suggestion of putting together an "educational paper" for "intelligent laypeople". Regarding the 5 focus topics, a few subjective comments: 1.) Abiding the law is maybe not the aspect I would stress... Rather, the characteristic that this whole thing is actually not magic: just distributed systems maintaining the contents of a "worksheet" (there, Roubini is onto something true, although his evaluation is wrong) by group consensus. What is important is that such systems can come in many sizes and forms - from very small closed networks (with meticulously vetted membership) to internet scale open ones (with the proverbial "unwashed messes" - although I don't really like the term - as membership.) And at the "lower" end of the scale, you don't even have to introduce "cryptocurrencies" and "cryptoassets". I don't know, maybe the point I try to get at is that we have to stress that the "boring blockchains" are rather different beasts. 2.) Sjir, I understand that you want to move away from a focus on the asset concept and I do agree with it - the problem is, that this is not exactly easy to do given the (publicly known) applications of Hyperledger Fabric... So this is something that may especially need justification with actual examples. 5.) I would rather say highly fault tolerant by nature - "no SPOF" is a very specific claim, depends on deployment design, you need to specify what you mean by (independent) faults and failures, etc.

And I respectfully propose one more focus point: "opportunities of blockchainification" (any native English speaker is heartfully thanked for translating this to actual English). Shedding a light on the "why", either in contrast to public blockchains or to centralized systems or both, seems to me to be important.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/training-and-education-wg?msg=myc4eCguggrbZudPZ) @SjirNijssen I don't have a taxonomy for this (should do a google scholar sweep again, some time elapsed since I lasted looked for it), but by example: for supply chains, "reducing friction" is one (I think IBM quotes a 70% reduction in cases where disagreement of parties needed some "documentation forensics"?); for markets where there's already a "trusted third party", trust disintermediation is there, sure, but not paying the costs and profits of that party can be a major thing; for existing, but fragmented markets without a trusted third party (to my knowledge, many-many-many correspondence banking scenarios) reduced costs without introducing a new third party (in that case, cost is not only operational - there's the aspect of FX conversion and other risks); for reinsurance and trade finance scenarios we should maybe ask some IBM people (-> we.trade); there are projects for academic degree verification and such -> in addition to the cost angle, there's trust and transparency. A lot of this is present in industry-specific publications in a bit fragmented way. And this is by far not only the central bank issued analyses; e.g. I read a nice analysis from PwC on the energy sector. Apparently, subscriber roaming is a thing there, too (or at least something the energy sectors wants, too; and something that telcos do through third parties on the financial side, as I was informed)...

@SjirNijssen And this is only moving existing business models to the blockchain; at the moment you have a consortium - a "marketplace", if you like - you can come up with nice and interesting ideas. I can't confirm this, but the cynic in me said early on (and there's this book to prove this: https://www.amazon.com/Supply-Chain-Finance-Blockchain-Technology-ebook/dp/B074KWQKYC, although can't find the time to read it) that the real importance of the supply chain scenarios is that once you have this platform, you can come up with financing, insurance and lending models that would have been practically impossible without the trusted network that the blockchain can provide.

As I said above: 3. direct inter-enterprise cooperation as an extension of intra-Enterprise cooperation (which has been developed during the last three centuries resulting in making available much more food and many more goods to many many people; think of the enormous increase of food, housing and other basics that became available in Europe since WWII for many more people tahn before). Let us find out the overlap between what you call "marketplace" and the "inter-enterprise cooperation". A lot of time has been invested in the last three centuries how to perform work within an organization more efficiently. With the inter-enterprise cooperation we can extend that work into this inter-enterprise territory. This inter-enterprise cooperation will be based on legally enforcible contracts. Let us clearly distinguish between these contracts and smart contracts, although the latter have to be based on the former. Legally enforcible contracts also means that the legal entities are known, including the relevant jurisdiction. Does that make sense? @ KellyCooper @yacovm @tkuhrt @DavidBoswell @tahaf10 @OlgaLarsen @Bobbijn @paulransfield and all other members of the T & E WG are invited to comment.

@SjirNijssen I agree with what you say. There should be a framework, or a reference point, or something like that to differentiate between a simple smart contract & a legal smart contract. And some guidelines which suggest some generic use-cases which are suitable for a legal smart contract implementation. There isn't much to go on in this direction right now

I met with a very experienced (European) notary a few weeks ago and discussed with him the new functionalities as discussed above. He was very interested to learn more. The planned discussion of 45 minutes became actually almost 2 hours. Please note that there is a big difference between the functions of a  European and US Notary.  
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 15:05:09 GMT):<br/>
@ikocsis My understanding of the functionalities of interest in the European Notary field is in the first place the immutability of documents and the second the inter-enterprise cooperation.

@KellyCooper @atcvince @ikocsis @tahaf10 @yacovm @paulransfield @tkuhrt @DavidBoswell @OlgaLarsen @Bobbijn and all other members of this channel. Let us continue the fruitful discussion of last weekend. My conclusion is that there is sufficient interest to write an article for a broad audience of end users and decision makers based on a large subset of the concept list developed so far. A subset of the concept list could be attached in an appendix. The article should focus on the effects of enterprise blockchain technology, with emphasis on Fabric. Imre says: "the characteristic that this whole thing is actually not magic: just distribited systems maintaining the contents of a "worksheet" by group consensus." Could we agree that the worksheet has two different but strongly related components, the transaction (transitions) and the current state. The transactions are immutable by simple magic, the state is not protected by that magic. The transaction consists of asserted facts, the state of derived facts. I propose to work point by point and then we base the article on the points receive sufficient endorsements. I look forward to your reactions.

Hence let us produce separate concept lists, is my proposal. Of course there is overlap in these lists. I have read so far very few messages in the chat channels by people that want to combine two or more platforms. As Fabric is ahead in the development race I believe it is reasonable to start with Fabric. We theareafter take the next according to availability of documentation. What do you think?

@tahaf10 Which concept definitions for fabric are missing in your opinion in the current concept list for end users and decision makers?
</p>
<p><strong>tahaf10</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 10:59:50 GMT):<br/>
Couple of things. At the end of the concept list there are 2 different headings for smart contracts and chaincode. In Fabric terms, they're the same thing. So I think the Smart Contract heading should be removed and the chaincode heading should simply define that in Hyperledger Fabric, Smart Contracts are referred to as chaincode. 
Secondly, I think there should be a little more detail on endorsement policy. This is key to the addition of new blocks into the blockchain in a trustless environment, and it should be explicitly explained to decision makers what endorsement policies are and that they can define endorsing policies according to their requirements. 
</p>
<p><strong>tahaf10</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 11:00:35 GMT):<br/>
Rest, I think is fine for a high-level perspective. If something else comes to my mind I'll let you know here
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 11:22:34 GMT):<br/>
@tahaf10 Thanks for your suggestions. Ad Smart contract and chaincode. It turns out that users of Fabric have asked to have Fabric terms more in line with the meaning known in industry. Provisionally it looks like the following: the term Smart Contract refers to the domain speficic code while chaincode will be used for domain independent code like the chaincode for life cycle management. Ad endorsement: I agree that endorsement is such an important topic in Fabric that it needs to be made very clear that it is the intent that management can indeed speficy all their endorsement functionality in a declarative endorsement policy.

Having given a good read of the concepts document, I think the concept list is really good (modulo editing and proofreading). What is missing for my (personal!) taste is (literally) a big picture figure with a conceptually very low resolution (so everybody can understand it right away; I know that took me an inconveniently long amount of pondering to come up with my low-res mental image of blockchains). This could serve as a "lead up"/"warmup" to the concept list. I put together one and will share it here shortly (I don't want to mess up the doc, first it will need the group's vetting.)
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 14:20:58 GMT):<br/>
@ikocsis Thanks for you suggestion. The big picture has been recently modified in the right direction, namely a much simpler API for the client application developer, while maintaining the same functionality. As this is currently in tests, I propose we move to the more understandable architecture. What do you think?

@KellyCooper I am one of the contributors of the metrics whitepaper (if we are talking about the PSWG-created document); I think the decision maker/end user concept list should be mostly complementary to that (some reconciliation should be certainly done, but only after the concept paper is finished).

Having visualized the current concept paper, I would maybe suggest a) working out governance and trust as a knowledge acquisition ordered concept list (these seem to be really important and the material is good, just not in-style); b) for decision makers and end users, I'm not sure any cryptography is needed; c) are the Fabric-specific things needed for such a document?

@atcvince @nathalie-ckc : Sorry for disappearing for a couple of weeks. I was traveling to Australia. I would really like to catch up on what I missed with the work that you were both doing with the EdX stuff. I believe I got the majority of your suggested changes into V2 of the course, but I am probably behind with my PR work. Thanks for all the hard work you both put into getting this done.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 22:39:16 GMT):<br/>
@atirekg : I noticed that you had a PR for some changes to the EdX course too, but I have not had a chance to review them. Was it a problem with versions that was causing errors?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/learning-materials-development-wg?msg=vpoCAKSWuvkxwTDLz) @tkuhrt May I invite you to be a bit more specific about the part "the concepts document may be a bit too complex". Do you mean: the fact that there are concepts lists for specific audiences, is a bit too complex and/or do you mean that the concept list for end users and decision makers is too complex? On the former a simple yes or no, would be appreciated, on the latter I would like to read which concept definitions of the 36 are, in your opinion, a bit too complex. In case the answer can be formulated in the channel before the next telecon, it gives us all an opportunity to be better prepared for the next telecon, or even better, have a fruitful exchange of thoughts before the telecon. Thanks for your attention.

Hello everyone! This is Andreas Vlachos, the Academic Coordinator Officer of the Blockchain Initiative at the University of Nicosia - the first university in the world to offer an MSc in Digital Currency and publish academic certificates on the Blockchain
I would really love to get your help on how our university can actively contribute to the Hyperledger Community. As a first step we are planning to create a Hyperledger-specific course on our MSc program
We are also planning to organize a Certified Hyperledger Specialist Workshop and would appreciate any contribution to this cause! https://dts.decentralized.com/certified-hyperledger-specialist/

Hello, I am Sofia Terzi from CERTH/ITI. Yesterday during the meeting I said that in my opinion in order to recruit new active members for the WG is to provide an easy way for them to understand how to start contributing. I volunteered to start a guide for people not so experienced in open source and communities. So I uploaded today the first version of the slides here `https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1r3kpCEhz84Yrh02330eT7EcvQM5F3gkd`  please comment. If the file needs to be moved elsewhere please inform me. Thank you

On the last meeting, I said I would prepare material to help understand how to use git/GitHub. 
I did not do that yet.  
I did extract from a meeting recording where Morgan Benton spent 12 minutes demonstrating 
how GitHub works enough to contribute to this group.   
go to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aPRBScMlFoixNYVgRLe3Uv_y66gcXFd9
click on GithubByMorganBenton.mp4 to play it. 

For those who are still uncomfortable about how to use it, please let me know about any 
confusion you may have on how to use it.  Either reply here or send me an email at r@uar.biz.
With that feedback, I can better design effective git/GitHub training material.

Smart Contracts feels more like a work group that a sig.  Are you talking about doing a workgroup proposal to do a smart contracts white paper?
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 17 Jan 2019 20:01:49 GMT):<br/>
we have official work groups right now on things like architecture that are doing an interop white paper, also a performance and scale wg, and Identity Wg that are all working on white papers for the community and sometimes working with the Projects themselves.

Hi, I wanted to remind everyone that we are in need of volunteers to monitor the LFS171x forum on edX, and assist students that have problems. While there are not a lot of them, your help is much appreciated.

Hi, I'm wondering why Hyperledger can't provide free online training e.g. Sawtooth and Fabric for potential developers and ambassadors, while organising free bootcamp in Hong Kong to enlist more helpers onboard?  Both the Blockchain: Understanding Its Uses and Implications and Introduction on Hyperledger Technologies courses (free enrolment), as the name implied, are just introduction. They are not detail enough for a developer to start setting up and understand the extensive framework for development purposes.

<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Mon, 22 Apr 2019 17:24:07 GMT):<br/>
i think it is a good first example of how we might increase outreach for WGs
</p>
<p><strong>aanburajan</strong> (Mon, 22 Apr 2019 17:26:00 GMT):<br/>
Hi everyone -- would love to help you with this membership drive ... A great first point of outreach is the monthly newsletter which is being written as we speak and will go out on Friday or Monday.  Can anyone share a write up or google form that you would like to use to get more eyeballs / potential leads for the WG? Are there other ways you have thought of marketing and doing outreach? We can build collateral and distribute on different channels based on what your needs and goals are
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Mon, 22 Apr 2019 17:26:53 GMT):<br/>
This group also works on the EdX Mooc - so that might also be another interesting Tie in
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Mon, 22 Apr 2019 17:27:16 GMT):<br/>
maybe even little prizes for spoting inaccuracies and fixing them or ??
</p>
<p><strong>aanburajan</strong> (Mon, 22 Apr 2019 17:27:33 GMT):<br/>
Well what I think would be great is this:
</p>
<p><strong>aanburajan</strong> (Mon, 22 Apr 2019 17:27:45 GMT):<br/>
a) Can we do a quick call or can you send me a quick summary of goals of the drive?
</p>
<p><strong>aanburajan</strong> (Mon, 22 Apr 2019 17:27:52 GMT):<br/>
b) Can we get something into this month's HL newsltter
</p>
<p><strong>aanburajan</strong> (Mon, 22 Apr 2019 17:28:17 GMT):<br/>
c) We'll come up with 5 to 6 different distribution ideas / channels and asks that we execute on over the next 3 to 4 weeks (or longer depending on your needs)
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Mon, 22 Apr 2019 17:29:12 GMT):<br/>
An internal ask - is to get each project to have a representative.  but externally - we are looking at translations too and how to best support thing
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Mon, 22 Apr 2019 17:29:20 GMT):<br/>
them
</p>
<p><strong>aanburajan</strong> (Mon, 22 Apr 2019 17:31:49 GMT):<br/>
Ok cool... so the main goal is to recruit people who can translate training materials?
</p>
<p><strong>fcioanca</strong> (Mon, 22 Apr 2019 17:38:19 GMT):<br/>
Hi @aanburajan one of the main goals for this group is to review and update existing training materials (especially when it comes to the edX MOOC), and write new training material (both for elearning, such as MOOC, or instructor-led purposes), and also to provide support in the MOOC forum, translate training materials, etc

</p>
<p><strong>aanburajan</strong> (Mon, 22 Apr 2019 17:39:30 GMT):<br/>
To have new members come in translate and update materials on HL? 
</p>

Here are the details of the group: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/LMDWG
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Mon, 22 Apr 2019 17:48:40 GMT):<br/>
The main goal is stated on the wiki page and it is a big larger than translating or updating materials
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Mon, 22 Apr 2019 17:51:50 GMT):<br/>
"It is focused on developing open source training material (licensed as specified by the Hyperledger Charter) to educate people interested in expanding their knowledge of Hyperledger and its projects. The working group will consult with other Hyperledger working groups, Hyperledger team members, and the project maintainers to identify training needs and develop strategies, as well as, material to address those needs. The output of this working group will be targeted towards both technical and non-technical audiences"

Hi all. In our 17 December and 31 December working group meetings, we will set group and personal goals for 2019 with Hyperledger. 

We can benefit from a focused, agreed upon set of work for 2019. 

We have members who are in learning mode. Personal learning goals that lead to creating documentation also serves our Learning Materials Development charter. In other words, if you know nothing about Burrow and want to, in 2019 creating a lesson, tutorial or presentation enhances your learning path and contributes to the group. 

We may have some members interested in collaborating on a project or building a PoC. Before our meeting, please consider what you are interested in for your own professional development path and/or what you are interested in working with on with a team.

In 2018 our viable content contribution is minimal. In part, because we contribute away from work hours whereas in some groups IBM, Intel, etc. employees may contribute while at work. That said, we need to amp up our game in 2019. Please bring ideas to the 17 December meeting or email ideas in if you are unable to attend.

Call 17 December 2018  @ 10:00 PST


Introductions from people new to the call

Flavia or Magda edX update

2019 Team Draft Plan (to be vetted and approved before 31 December)

Identify 2-3 Objectives

Check alignment of each objective to Group Charter and Hyperledger goals

Identify Key Results for each Objective

Align names and date ranges

2019 Individual Professional Development Draft Plan (to be set by 31 December)

Identify 2-3 individual or small group Objectives

Check alignment of each objective to personal goals and as a contribution to our working group

Identify Key Results for each Objective

Set up date ranges

@Bobbijn hi, maybe i can help with the key term documentation stuff? if help is needed any more
</p>
<p><strong>Bobbijn</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:00:37 GMT):<br/>
@rbole , Hello, that would be awesome. We have started collecting the key terms  from different resources and stored then on this wiki page: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2394127. The page needs to be organized . For additional resources, each project has developed documentation which can be accessed here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=6425586. Finally , please  add your name to this task on Resources page here https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2394031. Let me know if you have questions, @Bobbijn
</p>
<p><strong>rbole</strong> (Sat, 17 Aug 2019 08:05:27 GMT):<br/>
hi @Bobbijn I have some questions regarding the task. 

1.) What is the general purpose of collecting all key terms? 
2.) Should all keywords be collected only from Fabric or from all Hyperledger projects grouped by project?
3.) From the Fabric project you have all ready collected key terms from three resources: 

- https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/key_concepts.html
- LinuxFoundationX: LFS171x Blockchain for Business - An Introduction to Hyperledger Technologie
- Glossary Fabric

Are these all resources available?

4.) In what form should the key terms be collected?
5.) Is the specification of the source of a term necessary?
</p>
<p><strong>KellyCooper</strong> (Sun, 18 Aug 2019 17:07:03 GMT):<br/>
The Sovrin Glossary offers a lot of terms and is a great resource. https://sovrin.org/library/glossary/
</p>
<p><strong>rbole</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 07:40:17 GMT):<br/>
@KellyCooper ok, it looks great and has also links to further documentation.
</p>
<p><strong>Bobbijn</strong> (Mon, 19 Aug 2019 16:48:14 GMT):<br/>
@rbole The general purpose of the key terms is to have one spot "Key Terms" or glossary  for the community to access when creating Learning Materials. The key words should come from all the projects , not just fabric. To begin I thought we could start with the terms that will not be project specific.  For the first attempt, we can choose what terms best fit a general purpose guide. Just use your judgement. Can I  put you on the agenda next Monday to show the group where you are?  Bobbi

I did a course that I can point you to.  I'm also co-authoring two courses right now on SSI, Indy, Ursa and Aries that will be launching on edX soon.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 06 Sep 2019 17:22:01 GMT):<br/>
I did a chapter of the previous HL edX Bloackchain for business. That course has been updated without any of the project chapters so it's no longer online.  I'm also co-authoring two courses right now on SSI, Indy, Ursa and Aries that will be launching on edX soon.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 06 Sep 2019 17:23:36 GMT):<br/>
Soon = next month or so for the first (basics for business and technical audience), and then a developer course focused on building Aries agents.

Hi @swcurran , I worked with @VipinB on the Identity WG. Would love to help review any training material. Again, the goal is so that people who join the Identity WG, and HL at large, have a starting point on Identity. We want to provide new comers with a must read list of Identity 101.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 16:13:18 GMT):<br/>
We've done most of the materials for the new course.  If you are interested, we could give you access to review it. We'd sure appreciate it!

</p>
<p><strong>szewong</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 16:16:11 GMT):<br/>
google doc in general? or google doc within HL? I have a google account (szewong@gmail.com).

Any ideas? Please see screenshots.

<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Thu, 28 Nov 2019 10:52:24 GMT):<br/>
Hi everyone! Do you know who's in charge of EDX courses for Hyperledger? There's a course on Identity on Ursa, Aries and Indy, and we in Iroha also have some good examples of working with identity – we could add that as an additional chapter or smth. Who can talk about it to?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 28 Nov 2019 14:44:35 GMT):<br/>
Hi @SaraG - I'm a coauthor of that course, and we worked with Magda and Flavia at the Linux Foundation on the course.
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Sun, 08 Dec 2019 16:41:47 GMT):<br/>
Hi, nice to meet you! Do you think it is possible to add materials to the course with other projects involved? 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 08 Dec 2019 16:45:04 GMT):<br/>
My thought is that it probably doesn't fit, since in the course we are focused on the general identity use case (e.g. where OAuth, OIDC and the like apply, getting rid of "Login with Facebook"), and not on identity for blockchain.
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Sun, 08 Dec 2019 16:59:05 GMT):<br/>
Well, we did an identity project for one of the banks in Asia - it is built on Iroha blockchain (obviously), though it is not for blockchain, but for several companies (like insurance, banking etc) acting as a private blockchain network 
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Sun, 08 Dec 2019 17:00:35 GMT):<br/>
SSI's are also supported by Iroha 
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 08 Dec 2019 22:15:14 GMT):<br/>
Interesting stuff.  Can you point me to some material on the use case and I can see about a fit?
</p>
<p><strong>SaraG</strong> (Mon, 09 Dec 2019 10:28:22 GMT):<br/>
Sure, here's a press release https://www.newswire.com/news/applications-of-soramitsus-sora-platform-and-hyperledger-iroha-for-20902012 and the paper that our researchers published https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8377927
</p>

Please let me know if there are any questions! I can contact the developers about that

The LMDWG meeting starts in less than 20 minutes.  https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/LMDWG/Learning+Materials+Development+Working+GroupCatch up on community happenings and hear a great presentation: Presentation:  Otavio Oliveira, Binarystar Japan, to present their Translation Management System:  
Building a unified terminology database and translation memory for all things related to Hyperledger using our translation management system. 

To enhance all global localization efforts,  A machine learning-based TB(Term Base) and TM(Translation Memory) can dramatically speed up all languages' efforts. 

For the way, Hyperledger handles the translation process of different e-courses and other contents having this global translation memory and terminology base for all things Hyperledger, we see it as crucial. 

Work on  leading localization efforts.

Hi, do you know where I can find guidelines on how to deploy the open source distribution of Hyperledger Fabric 2.2 on OpenShift 4? OpenShift 4 uses podman/cri-o as a container engine instead of Docker so the deployment is a bit tricky to me. Is there any more relevant channel to ask this question ? Thanks ahead!
