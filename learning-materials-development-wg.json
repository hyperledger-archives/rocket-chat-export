It also covers business application strategies and an engagement model for deploying selecting and deploying blockchain applications https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-blockchain-essentials-for-developers\n\nHere are the IBM course related \"build your first...\" \"Writing Your First Application\" links https://goo.gl/bc6D7k   https://goo.gl/xFg9cG\n\nThere are many other online blockchain courses but these are good starting points.\n\nLastly, I will be a Subject Matter Expert/Learning Facilitator on Oxford Blockchain Strategy Programme the first programme cohort will start on 28 Februrary 2018, and will run for 6 weeks https://goo.gl/Q3iBC8.  It's executive education level program so no web-application development but blockchain implementation business strategy.","username":"Everymans.ai","ts":"2018-02-02T15:53:54.351Z"}

{"msg":"@Everymans.ai   I see in the E&T doc that you want a reaction to your proposal: \"AI & Blockchain integration to build DAO with Intelligence, ie, IDAO.  Instead of just having deterministic Smart Contract coded instructions build in machine learning algorithm trained decision models.  The AI/ML technology stack is mature and API driven.  Combining an intelligent layer with a distributed, decentralized ledger layer is compelling and inevitable.  So high level management needs to have a strategic outlook and roadmap for how these 2 new computing layers will work together.  So, use AI (more mature than blockchain stack) to introduce blockchain technology and kill 2 birds with one stone.  Any thoughts please email george@everymans.ai or tag me in chat.hyperledger.org @everymans.ai\"     I believe that it would be a good idea to first circulate a working paper to the members of the T & E WG outlining in a few pages that such an approach makes a reasonable chance with high level magagement. In my experiece (79 years old) AI is in the eyes of senior management far from mature; too many promises made in the past that have not come true. Yes, I believe AI is now more mature than 25 years ago, but let us be careful not to oversell it another time.

I teach code and IoT in the community college system and I teach organizational development in a US graduate school (part time).

From 2017 I started working as a freelance dedicating a lot of time studying & playing on blockchains (mainly Bitcoin and EVM). Now I am providing services like training, PoC, architectures and consultancy. A couple of months ago I have been involved on an Hyperledger project (fabric + composer) and so I started looking into the Hyperledger offers. In my opinion, Hyperledger could be one of the most important drivers for the worldwide blockchain's adoption. That's why I would be more than happy to join the Hyperldeger community and share some efforts. I thought to start with this group as training and education are one of my favourite fields.

Day\nVerzonden: zaterdag 24 maart 2018 11:25\nAan: Hyperledger Fabric discussion list <hyperledger-fabric@lists.hyperledger.org>\nOnderwerp: [Hyperledger-fabric] can you reconfigure/limit channel data after the fact?\n\n\n  (not sure if this is something explained in the docs i haven't got to yet but here goes.)\n\n  i audited LF's hyperledger course and, in the middle of that, i started to wonder about one of the examples. we had fisherman sarah, who caught tuna and sold them to a number of clients. now imagine that sarah and her clients have established their own channel, where they can all see sarah's catch, how much she sells to each client, and the common price she charges all of them. so, initially, her price to each of her clients is exactly the same so she has no problem with that data being part of that channel that everyone is allowed to see.\n\n  after a while, sarah decides to give one of her clients (miriam) a discount, and would rather not have everyone else know about that. how would that be done, if it's even possible? until then, the price that sarah was charging was visible to everyone on the channel. if sarah suddenly wants to change that price for a single client, what has to happen?\n\n  would the existing channel have to be reconfigured? partitioned?\nrebuilt from scratch? and it's not clear that would even solve the problem since, all of a sudden, all of sarah's *other* clients would notice that they can't see her sale price to miriam anymore (or perhaps not see her sale price at all), so they might suspect\n*something* was up.\n\n  in general, then, once you establish a channel and it runs for a while, how hard is it to reconfigure what members of that channel are allowed to see?\n\nrday\n\n\n_______________________________________________\nHyperledger-fabric mailing list\nHyperledger-fabric@lists.hyperledger.org\nhttps://lists.hyperledger.org/mailman/listinfo/hyperledger-fabric\n","username":"SjirNijssen","ts":"2018-03-24T11:05:41.019Z"}

It's a bit dicey to defend or refute products this early, especially when they have global hype.

{"msg":"@phanikumar - My thoughts, if I may. A database, irrespective of access control can be changed after data is commited by for instance a database administrator. Once again you trusting a central authority. In addition, replication of data can become a nightmare with all the integrity constraints across many relational databases(nodes). If I read and understand the documentation correctly, a blockchain only uses a database such as couchdb to record the current state.Still learning. The blockchain in itself stays immutable. Consensus on a blockchain in a trustless way prevents for instance duplication based on rules defined. Imagine the same record being updated on two different databases at the same time, without consensus, which one is correct? Databases and Blockchains both are great, each with their own strenghts and suited for different use cases. The edX Intro to HyperLegder course has a nice section on where blockchains are perhaps not ideal.   ","username":"roleybrown","ts":"2018-05-23T12:29:32.678Z"}

{"msg":"The Hyperledger T & E WG approved today the following: \"•Proposed transaction: Let us select the 15 most essential concepts (is not terms) in Fabric, Sawtooth, Burrow and Iroha, and describe clearly, using illustrating relevant examples, understandable to end users and management, how they relate, overlap and where they are different; look forward to endorsements.\"\n\nOn behalf of the WG I submit to you the first two concepts descriptions:   A blockchain is an append-only data structure; a blockchain (instance) consists at any moment in time of a number of blocks. A block contains a number of transactions. The contents of a block is encrypted and each block contains a hash of major parts. It contains also a copy of the hash of the previous block and this is the reason for the term chain. A transaction proposal is a proposal by a client application or administrator to the blockchain network community. The network community can decide to make the transaction proposal a valid transaction, or is classified as an invalid transaction. Please let us know which improvements you want to make to these two concept definitions. Thanks ","username":"SjirNijssen","ts":"2018-06-04T20:10:18.457Z"}

{"msg":"@Chris0708 and all other members of the Hyperledger T & E WG. I propose we discuss the various aspects step by step such that every member of the WG can contribute.                       I prefer to refer positively to the intended audience as end users and decision makers.                       Please let us know if you support or do not support this.     I believe we are in agreement that the first concept to describe is blockchain. As a result of the proposal of Chris I propose the following new state of the Blockchain definition:   A blockchain is a chain of blocks each containing transaction data. Each block, except the first block, is linked to the previous block and each block except the last one is linked to the next block. Hence the link is not directional; block N contains, besides its own hash, a copy of the hash of the previous block.      Once a block has entered the blockchain, it is like chiselled in granite. This characterictic delivers the immutability of the data in the blockchain, also referred to as temper-free data or virually incorruptable data. This aspect is one of the main reasons for the broad interest in blockchain technology.            In computer science language a blockchain is an append-only data structure; a blockchain (instance) consists at any moment in time of a number of blocks. If the chain has N blocks, then it has N-1 links, for N>=1. Hence when there is only one block, there in no link.         Wrt Merkle-root, I do not believe that an enduser, nor decision maker is willing to invest energy in that concept.            If there are dimensions that I have overlooked, please let me know.             As block headers are different in the different Hyperledger platforms, we have to be very careful, either we only describe the common fields of the header or per platform all  fields.  In Fabric the blockheader contains three fields, the block-ID, an integer number staring with 0, a copy of the hash of the previous block (except for block 0) and the hash of the payload of the current block.                     Please add the header fields of Sawtooth, Iroha or Burrows, if you know them. Thanks. Feedback is very welcome. ","username":"SjirNijssen","ts":"2018-07-18T16:04:07.622Z"}

You would help me to adopt this principle if I could do the following: suppose that you need to communicate the concept of stack example 2 to a person that has been a software engineer during the last 40 years, but he got an accident last month and now he can temporarily not use his eyes, but his ears are perfect and the background is known.

{"msg":"@paulransfield Paul, I am convinced that the best investement in the knowledge description of Hyperledger platforms is to provide an optimal ratio of declarative and procedural knowledge. Currently I consider the ratio far from optimal. This can best be accomplished, in my experience, by producing separate lists of concepts for the various audiences like end users, decision makers, application and blockchain architects, client application developers, admins, smart contract developers and platform developers.  In the T & E WG we have started with the concept list for end users and decision makers. If we move to the next audience, I believe we have to go first to the different platforms. For practical reasons I have started that work for Fabric. For the Fabric architect my estimate is currently between 75 and 150 concepts. I would welcome your cooperation in speeding up that development. I want to express my bias that I am very focussed on quality of understandable declarative and procedural knowledge. The list for the Fabric platform developers will be according to my current estimate, between 600 and 1000 concepts, and that is a very large number of tightly related concepts.

{"msg":"@paulransfield Thank you for the suggestions. Let us discuss these one by one. First a little addition to the minutes of the last telecon. My estimate was 75 to 150 concepts **for Fabric architects**. I believe that the concept list for end users and decision makers will stabilize  between 30 and 40 concepts; we currently have about 30, and thus we could finish the list of the concepts for the first audience soon.  I propose that we will contantly encourage persons to improve that list. The next list to stabilize is for the Fabric Architect. As said above the numbers are different for the different professional groups.  I believe the most effective way of developing a concept list for an audience is to observe the communication in that audience community. Hence all facts used by that community are facts about certain things or certain names and thus we need a concept description for that thing or name, unless they can be assumed to be known, and for certain verbs in the facts we need to provide the meaning in a concept definition to avoid misunderstandings. That is the protocol we have followed so far. If there is a better one, I would gladly look at it. ","username":"SjirNijssen","ts":"2018-08-08T20:35:18.394Z"}

{"msg":"@paulransfield @KellyCooper Hi Paul and Kelly, Let us carefully consider the options. I would like that we treat this like any other product. Namely start with the requirements of the (end) users. I define end users as people that want to learn the essential knowledge of Enterprise grade blockchain technology, while keeping the ratio between declarative (and usually easier to unsterstand) knowledge (structure) and procedural complexity (process) at a healthy optimum. Hence first focus on the quality of the knowledge. The persons that have to produce the declarative knowledge (structure) and the procedural knowledge (process, animation) should be given the freedom to use tools that best satisfy the requirements of the end users of the educational product. My observation of the various documents was that the optimum ratio as mentioned above is so far not achieved. What is critical? That we recognize that there are several different users classes of people wrt Enterprise grade blockchain. We have at least the following: end users, decision makers, application and blockchain architects, admins, client application developers, smart contract developers and platform developers. I have been working on concept lists for these groups for several months now and the numbers are extremely different. Current estimates: End users 30-40, architects 75-150, platform developers 600-1000. Hence a fundamental decision is that we serve the 7 different classes of users in an optimal way. As you may conclude I focus on quality of knowledge and delivering that knowledge in the best possible way. A do myself not consider an expert in educational technology, but I am amazed at what quality of animation some presenters achieve with pptx and some extensions. I hope this is not forbidden territory. Kelly and Paul, please let me have your thoughts on this. Kind regards   PS Paul, I am happy to come back to your 5 points above, once I have a clearer idea what you and Kelly think about this. ","username":"SjirNijssen","ts":"2018-08-11T07:18:50.645Z"}

{"msg":"@paulransfield Thanks for the update. I propose to remove B0, B1, B2 and B3. I propose to remove HO three times from block 0, and put it in one time in accordance with D0 and M0. I propose to replace genenis with \"configuration\". Genesis is a synynym for the entire first block with blocknumber 0. The three fields of block 0 in the header are: 0 ; - (as there is no previous block), 7a2 (an abbreviation for the 64 charachter, or 7...a2, is that fits). The block with number 0 can be read as follows: The block, identified within the application channel with the name org1org2org3, by the integer 0, has in the field hashPreviousBlock the value null, and has as contents of the third field, hashCurrentBlock the value 7...a2. In the first diagram only this block should be there.  I like the arrangement and renaming of the transactions. The first 10 transactions correspond with the 10 fabcar transaction in BYFN; I have added 2 transactions Tx10 and Tx11 to make the example more realistic. Can we build up the diagramseries in this way step and step and I am prepared to propose a text that can be corrected by you as English native and can be read by you as voice over.

{"msg":"@paulransfield Hi Paul, I propose that we start the animation with a diagram containing an empty blockchain. We do remark that Fabric is so far the only platform that provides several private blockchains (1-1 associated with the concept channel) in one and the same Fabric network. We start the animation for one specific channel, and the contents of the blockchain is empty. Fabric stores in the first block, identified by the number 0 (see the first field in the header), configuration information. The second field in the header is the hash of the previous block; as there is no previous block for block 0, this field is null. The third field contains the hash of the contents of the data section of block 0. As we do not have the space to represent the 64 characters in the diagram, we abbreciate the value of the third field to 7...a2. Hence as we store the first block (block 0), there is no link. In block 1 we see that the data section of the block contains 5 transactions. These 5 transactions are copied from the fabcar example in the Build Your First Network section of the Fabric 1.2 documentation. The first field in the header of block 2 contains the number 1; the second field, hashPreviousBlock contains the value 7...a2. Hence the value of the second field of the header of block 1 is equal to the value of the third field of the header of block 0. The hash of the data section of the block with number 1 (the second block) is b...87. Is this helpful? Paul please feel totally free to correct my Dutch English. I look forward to the work that you planned.  ","username":"SjirNijssen","ts":"2018-08-13T17:48:08.475Z"}

{"msg":"Thanks, @KellyCooper. I just made it through my backlog of messages on this channel. @atcvince @nathalie-ckc @Thaddeus : I want to thank you all for the work that you have been putting into converting the EdX course content into Markdown files. We did lock down a bit on the \"write\" access to the education repo. We want to be sure that people are using forks of the repositories and pull requests for changes made. This way, we can review it and catch any formatting issues before the changes get put in place. The other thing that normally throws people off if they use the Github UI directly to edit files is that they fail to include the appropriate DCO sign-off lines. Since Hyperledger's charter requires that all contributions have DCO signoffs, it is important step. This step is normally not simple with the Github UI, but from the command line, the -s option of git commit will add those details for you. I hope the Gist that Kelly refers to will provide some good information to help others contribute.

For the static set, zero or more peers can be configured as leaders. For the dynamic set, one peer will be elected leader by the set. Moreover, in the dynamic set, if a leader peer fails, then the remaining peers will re-elect a leader.\n\nIt means that an organization’s peers can have one or more leaders connected to the ordering service.

{"msg":"@OlgaLarsen @Bobbijn Thank you for helping as a tech writer with the concept list for the audience end users and decision makers. On the basis of observation of many chat messages my conclusion is that a concept list for an unspecified audience results in an imprecise and an insuffiently consistent set of  concecpt definitions. As there are several different audiences involved, end user and decision makers, blockchain architects, blockchain admins, client app developers, smart contract developers and platform developers, we have so far asked ourselves the question: what does the end user and decision maker audience need to know to be able to do their job in a blockchain based system specification, development, deployment and maintenance. Originally the idea was to have one Hyperledger concept list for each audience, independent of the platform and provide special notes for each platform that has a deviation from the general definition. Looking at the questions in the chat channels, I wonder whether that is the most productive approach. My analytics processor comes to the conclusion that the vast majority of questions have to do with a specific platform. It is also objective observation that Fabric has the largest amount of questions. What do you think of the idea to specialize the list we now have for each of the 5 platforms, with Fabric as the first one to be delivered? @KellyCooper ","username":"SjirNijssen","ts":"2018-09-24T19:44:09.538Z"}

{"msg":"@SjirNijssen My pleasure. :)  I've just added the governance piece. Have a look. As for the Users: There is a big difference between the very-end-users, corporate decision-makers and the technical teams (admins, etc.). I would probably give an overview of the technology and describe the benefits and some glossary, BUT split the \"usability\" part into 2 pieces: 1. For non-technical end-users - explain how exactly they are going to be using the system (steps, which applications, etc.) 2. For Technical Users (admins, system engineers, etc.) - what apps are available, what are the technical best practices, systems diagrams, etc.  Just a thought...","username":"OlgaLarsen","ts":"2018-09-24T20:21:29.479Z"}

{"msg":"@KellyCooper @atcvince @yacovm @ikocsis @tkuhrt @DavidBoswell @tahaf10 @OlgaLarsen @Thaddeus @paulransfield @Bobbijn and all other members of the T & E WG. Thank you for all the suggestions. As a result I propose to focus on the following 5 related topics 1. blockchain for law abiding applications  2. immutable facts, rules and concept definitions (hence move away from the narrow asset concept)  3. direct inter-enterprise cooperation as an extension of intra-Enterprise cooperation (which has been developed during the last three centuries) 4. digital identities 5. no single point of failure, and the associated conceptual view of the current implementation technology. Please let me know whether you agree or want to include further topics. I still believe that the set of basic and supporting concepts is already for the most part available in the existing concept list for end users and decision makers. The proposal is to add a readable text such that intelligent laypeople can easily understand the contents and extend this with an interactive component. Please let the channel members know what you think about this proposal.","username":"SjirNijssen","ts":"2018-10-21T16:20:10.055Z"}
{"msg":"This article is really surprising and disheartening, especially so that Roubini is so high-profile (even I, a layman in economics, recognize his name)... The paper bends quite a few facts to serve its underlying agenda and is flat-out factually wrong on most points for consortial blockchains/DLTs. I support Sjir's suggestion of putting together an \"educational paper\" for \"intelligent laypeople\". Regarding the 5 focus topics, a few subjective comments: 1.) Abiding the law is maybe not the aspect I would stress... Rather, the characteristic that this whole thing is actually not magic: just distributed systems maintaining the contents of a \"worksheet\" (there, Roubini is onto something true, although his evaluation is wrong) by group consensus. What is important is that such systems can come in many sizes and forms - from very small closed networks (with meticulously vetted membership) to internet scale open ones (with the proverbial \"unwashed messes\" - although I don't really like the term - as membership.) And at the \"lower\" end of the scale, you don't even have to introduce \"cryptocurrencies\" and \"cryptoassets\". I don't know, maybe the point I try to get at is that we have to stress that the \"boring blockchains\" are rather different beasts. 2.) Sjir, I understand that you want to move away from a focus on the asset concept and I do agree with it - the problem is, that this is not exactly easy to do given the (publicly known) applications of Hyperledger Fabric... So this is something that may especially need justification with actual examples. 5.) I would rather say highly fault tolerant by nature - \"no SPOF\" is a very specific claim, depends on deployment design, you need to specify what you mean by (independent) faults and failures, etc.","username":"ikocsis","ts":"2018-10-21T20:03:04.409Z"}

In our 17 December and 31 December working group meetings, we will set group and personal goals for 2019 with Hyperledger. \n\nWe can benefit from a focused, agreed upon set of work for 2019. \n\nWe have members who are in learning mode. Personal learning goals that lead to creating documentation also serves our Learning Materials Development charter. In other words, if you know nothing about Burrow and want to, in 2019 creating a lesson, tutorial or presentation enhances your learning path and contributes to the group. \n\nWe may have some members interested in collaborating on a project or building a PoC.
