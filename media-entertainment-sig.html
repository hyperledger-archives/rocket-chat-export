I was checking the group's wiki page to get to know you all a bit more through the members' directory: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/MESIG/Media+and+Entertainment+SIG
</p>
<p><strong>alexchainstack</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 03:13:40 GMT):<br/>
It looks like the link to the members list leads to the Climate Action SIG, though. Happy to fix it if you can share the location of the directory.

Morning all @davidwboswell attempting to add myself to the Member Directory returns Not Permitted Im logged in to LF as brettr@accurati.us -  any assistance would be great - no rush for this Thank you https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/MESIG/Member+Directory

<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 15:39:32 GMT):<br/>
@alexchainstack -- thanks for pointing out that there is a link that points to the Climate Action SIG.  i used some of their wiki pages as a template so i may have missed updating a link somewhere.  feel free to edit the wiki to fix or let me know where you're seeing that link and i can update it.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 15:42:20 GMT):<br/>
@Brettsy -- sorry to hear that you're running into an issue editing the wiki.  i double checked the permissions on the wiki and it seems like everyone should have access, but maybe there is something going on with your account.  could you try logging in again and trying to edit the member directory page?  and could you try editing a different page on the wiki too -- we could see if there is something specific about that one page or if this is a general issue.
</p>
<p><strong>Brettsy</strong> (Mon, 08 Feb 2021 17:18:44 GMT):<br/>
Thank you...will do and will advise

Morning David @davidwboswell I have no problem logging in/out of my LF account (brettr@accurati.us) Did that. When I attempt to log in to my account from the wiki page (https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/MESIG/Meetings) I get the NOT PERMITTED page - to be clear, I can access the MESIG wiki if Im NOT logged in. Once I log in, the page only shows the NOT PERMITTED. I can see the toolbar but I can no longer see thePAGE TREE or content.  Thanks for your help. No rush here. I should make you aware that I have two LF accounts but I use different emails for each. brettr@bigbtc.ca  and brettr@accurati.us - On my brettr@accurati.us LF account I added an alterante email brettr@bigbtc.ca. FYI I maintain the  the bigbtc profile because Im registered for CHFA + CHSA exams and do the HL Southern Georgian Bay MEETUP under that address.  Sorry if the duplicate accounts is messing you up.

Thanks for the good meeting, today on Tuesday. One comment regarding the communication channel:
Slack has this great advantage that it is a tool which is broadly used by many people, who are used to dealing with multiple Slack accounts, to browsing through the messages and replying fast and in a timely manner. 
I personally have Slack open all the time and experience that people I work with are pretty responsive.
Furthermore, you can connect e.g. Google Docs or presentation to share some notes.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 22:12:55 GMT):<br/>
@sposth -- you're right that slack is a great tool and more people prefer it to the rocket.chat option.  the one bonus for using this channel though is that you are able to be in touch with other community members.  for instance, if you have a question about fabric, for instance, the fabric developers are here and you can ask them questions or invite them to this channel.  if the group moved somewhere else you would then be isolated from the wider community.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 22:13:20 GMT):<br/>
that having been said, the group can change if you want.  just sharing my thoughts on the trade-off :)
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 22:33:02 GMT):<br/>
ok, sounds frustrating.  we filed a ticket with IT.  something seems busted on confluence.

If people would rather be on Slack, let’ me know. It’s what I use to teach with. Sorry about the dog barking today. She is usually 100% silent. :dog: :x: (Slack is arguably already a old man’s tool - a lot of my students have jumped ship in favor of Discord :))
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Wed, 10 Feb 2021 00:30:37 GMT):<br/>
@Brettsy and @gskerry -- can you try again?  i think the issue may be fixed.  IT found an LDAP bug that may have been the problem.  let me know if it does or doesn't work for you.
</p>
<p><strong>alexchainstack</strong> (Wed, 10 Feb 2021 05:32:44 GMT):<br/>
Thank you, David. I have now fixed it - I couldn't find the link to this document https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/MESIG/Member+Directory

<p><strong>alexchainstack</strong> (Wed, 10 Feb 2021 05:33:33 GMT):<br/>
Now that it's been shared here, I used it to edit the link to it on the MESIG. and add my details to the directory.

I mention in my project proposal that my data set was donated to a museum in LA. They just launched a very cool walkthrough. It should help to make the project less abstract — and also help us imagine how music could be used in this test environment as we build two platforms: heritage / museum and contemporary/ commercial https://wendemuseum.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e5dde27cccb6b86e8fc849d5d&id=ac1141cced&e=9fb8316a40

Very well done! It is high resolution version of https://decentraland.org/ or cryptovoxels.com/. Both platforms have attracted virtual galleries like https://superrare.co/ or https://opensea.io/. In these VR galleries the artworks are NFTs that are either for sale or just hanging on the walls for exhibition purposes. Just in a real VR :)

I have questions regarding the chain governance and set-up of the distributed curation platform (DCP) on Hyperledger Fabric. 

1) I assume that a blockchain using Hyperledger Fabric is permissioned in the sense that only known actors or entities can send transactions or write on the chain. Is this correct? 
And if so, does this apply to both networks, the MN (Museum Network) as well as the CN (Commercial Network). 

2) Will the blockchain be public pnermissioned in the sense that the blockchain is open for anyone to read specific input data from the chain? Would / could there be a difference depending on the network, the MN (Museum Network) or the CN (Commercial Network).

My thinking is: If you want to support trade or commercial activities, you need to provide metadata, identifiers, links to further terms and conditions which would imo require the blockchain to be open for reading purposes.

I have questions regarding the model, chain 'governance' or set-up of the distributed curation platform (DCP), which will be based on Hyperledger Fabric. 
https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Media+and+Entertainment+SIG+Proposal

1) I assume that a blockchain network using Hyperledger Fabric is permissioned in the sense that only known, identifiable actors or entities can send transactions or write on the chain. Is this correct? 
And if so, does this apply to both networks of the project: the MN (Museum Network) as well as the CN (Commercial Network)?

2) Will the blockchain be public in the sense that the blockchain is open for anyone to read specific input data from the chain? There could be a difference depending on the network, the MN (Museum Network) or the CN (Commercial Network).

My thinking is: If you want to support trade or commercial activities by using blockchain technology, rightsholders need to be able to either provide metadata, identifiers, links to further terms & conditions or connect them to identifiers, identities or transactions, which would require the blockchain to be open for reading purposes. Discoverability is the most crucial advantage of trade in web 3.0 media environments to the current situation. Also think of the NFT model, where the terms are public, so that any gallery can offer, sell or resell the NFTs without the need to ask the rightsholder.  
If you deal with value transfer, tokenisation, ownership, transfer, decentralised identities and the like, these assets, statui, access ot keys or tokens needs to be verifiable, which would also require an open and public network, which very well can (some might say) must be permissioned.

I am not sure whether Hyperledger Fabric (and/or your idea of the project) supports this.

<p><strong>DavidMacFadyen</strong> (Fri, 12 Feb 2021 19:37:57 GMT):<br/>
Thanks very much, Vipin and Sebastian:

Let’s consider two our proposed scenarios—a Museum Network (MN) and a Commercial Network (CN). 

MN
Our test-case participant is singular—the Wende Museum of the Cold War in Los Angeles 

1. Here’s an overview https://laacollective.org/work/cold-war-spaces-at-the-wende-museum 
2. and a 3D walkthrough of the building https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=6H92bxJF48K. 

I have donated my collection to them, but am taking archival responsibility for it. The museum’s goal is to display the collection while minimizing the likelihood of theft. Perhaps even loan out items (as suggested below).

Indeed, if we draw a parallel with the application of blockchain to hi-resolution images in fine art museums and galleries, then it’s possible to imagine a scenario in which an entirely “audible” institution like the Grammy Museum in LA (https://grammymuseum.org/) could lend out metadata-rich files to lesser organizations, while monitoring their usage. The monitoring/resulting data would both help the museum plan more appealing exhibitions in the future and, in the case of living authors, get funds to those same authors in realtime. 

Hence my desire to include an audio player that tracks streams, as a form of file access or “usage.” 

The network in this case would be governed by the museum itself. The museum might want to host the collection on their own servers, or I could arrange a server setup with AWS or some similar cloud-based enterprise. 

In the MN instance, the logical limits of a public-facing write would be crowdsourcing of historical data, with rare tracks enriched by members of the public who know the attribution of old songs. I’ve seen this work attempted by companies such as Melodiya, which used to be the primary state recording company in the Soviet Union. Their Moscow archives are a treasure trove of badly documented tapes, wax discs, acetates, cylinders, etc—often with penciled box-notes that faded in the sunlight decades ago. Melodiya started posting snippets online to see if people knew what on earth was in all those demos... https://melody.su/en/

————
CN
Here we could split the network again into two. Let’s imagine two versions of CN:

     CN1. A network run by major labels 
     CN2. A network run by minor labels—or by some regional (perhaps stylistic) team of kindred musicians. One town, one county, or one genre.

In the case of CN1 we see the type of situation that makes HLF so popular with corporations. CN1 would be for a small number of participating companies with already established artists. They collectively oversee the network, storing the files in a jointly operated cloud repo. From here files would be streamed (monitoring plays simultaneously and paying out to artists directly in real time). 

So, while this would mean a reduction in percentage payments/cuts for the big labels, those companies would actually gain greater (and new) income from monitoring people/radio stations/shopping malls accessing the same files, 24/7. Artists are therefore paid more fairly by their labels—and labels are paid more fairly by the public.

No real need for a public-facing write API here, unless one wishes to let the artists update existing information.

*

In the case of CN2, a more decentralized scenario transpires. No major labels—if any at all—and the artists together host their data. Here the public-facing read/write functionality is essential, since the artists record and catalog everything themselves. 

If, therefore, we imagine a CN2 in which non-members are invited to join a regional or stylistically specific network, then everything would be added to that network by potential strangers. (Or by recently accepted members.) 

The advantage here for CN2 is that rotation figures on Spotify are, for most artists, risible. I am not sure what happened to the project Forgotify (https://routenote.com/blog/forgotify-brings-the-unheard-music-of-spotify-to-your-ears/) but it’s currently down; it usually hosts countless tracks that have (almost) never been played on Spotify and then randomizes playlists from them. 

Most tracks are either never played or immediately forgotten. A local scene (“music from Pittsburgh”) or one style (“Estonian folk music”) could gather more attention and income if it broke away from the bottomless ocean of Spotify, Apple Music, etc and promoted itself to less numerous but more committed fans, claiming all income in the process.

# Re/ MN

For the MN I see two use cases: 

1) Digital lending
2) Decentralised curation and records management

Re/ 1) Digital lending
The rightsholder (Wende Museum) could generate and register ISCC, and then associate metadata and licensing terms to the ISCC on the blockchain. The assets can be tokenized as fungible or non-fungible tokens.

A third party curator and possible licensee could select an individual choice of content from the rightsholder collection that he wants to use for his purpose. If this purpose has been granted by the licensor as part of the licensing terms associate to the ISCC, a licensing transaction can be triggered in various ways:

a) The licensee could acquire a defined number of streams. In this case the number of streams / loans could be tracked by a media player or otherwise defined.
b) The licensee could acquire a right to stream for a defined period of time. Access to the content could be granted by an application that checks verifiable credentials (VC) which have been issued by the rightsholder and licensor to the licensee after the licensing transaction. 
c) Content could be provided for research purposes according to the general academic standards.

If those models would work, this could be a valuable proof-of-concept for the entire industry and would benefit media organisations in all parts of the world. Tracking of digital lending is an issue for publishers in all parts of the world.

Re/ 2) Decentralised curation and records management
The rightsholder (Wende Museum) could generate, register ISCC and associate metadata with the ISCC. 

a) Third party archives and museums could do the same and identify same or similar digital assets.
b) In case of matches, metadata could be exchanged, suggested, enriched, added, verified or corrected for quality ensurance (crowdsorcing of historic data) by verified parties.

# Re/ CN
A comment on the CN distinction. 
A closed, proprietary service with a joint fulfillment and distribution service might be hard to establish. From my conversations with the music industry and long-time collaboration with a major audio distributor, this represents the current status quo. There is not a lot of revenue to add or convenience to gain by switching an existing business to a different service that matches with the current situation.

However, I see use cases that are of interest:

- Easier access to and exchange of better metadata – this is the golden standard of problems.
- Compensation of composers of audio works – obviously a big problem in the music industry.
- Supporting microsales for sync licenses for social sharing – how can users legitimately license and share a lady gaga on their social media? Supporting tokenization (NFTs) for audio.
- Supporting competition in the subscription market – How could I open up a subscription service for my customers and audience and easily get access to the licenses? (compare it to college radio stations), or think of legal, licensed music streaming in the Metaverse (Decentraland, Cryptovoxels), on Discord, on Clubhouse, Zoom, etc.

In my opinion, these use cases could – in principle – be set-up with the same technology and processes as the MN, so that structurally, eventually MN and CN might not be all too different in the basic requirements, but the use cases might be different. Especially in the expression of rights (rights expression languages REL) and the fulfillment (DRM, access control) post-transaction.

Happy Valentine’s Day to one and all!  :rose: :cupid: 

I have rearranged, re-edited, and simplified the project statement, increasing readability and proposing that we do everything possible to hide diverging transactions (for-profit, non-profit) behind one UI. That makes life simpler for everybody. 

https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=41591166

We’re getting close to a small number of project sections, each associated with a specific technology. Now’ s the time to have your say!

I have incorporated Sebastian’s thoughts and notes, but wonder if he’d like to suggest how much of the section “DECENTRALIZED CONTENT IDENTIFICATION. ASSOCIATION OF METADATA AND RIGHTS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION” he’d like to replace with this section from his last email?

The rightsholder (Wende Museum) could generate and register ISCC, and then associate metadata and licensing terms to the ISCC on the blockchain. The assets can be tokenized as fungible or non-fungible tokens.

A third party curator and possible licensee could select an individual choice of content from the rightsholder collection that he wants to use for his purpose. If this purpose has been granted by the licensor as part of the licensing terms associate to the ISCC, a licensing transaction can be triggered in various ways:

a) The licensee could acquire a defined number of streams. In this case the number of streams / loans could be tracked by a media player or otherwise defined.
b) The licensee could acquire a right to stream for a defined period of time. Access to the content could be granted by an application that checks verifiable credentials (VC) which have been issued by the rightsholder and licensor to the licensee after the licensing transaction. 
c) Content could be provided for research purposes according to the general academic standards.


I see that people are slowly moving to the Rocket Chat at HL (https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/media-entertainment-sig)

Thus far, I am not sensing any real enthusiasm for moving to Slack. Let me know if that’s not the case. The benefit of some chat-space is that the emails will lessen :)

@sposth I had similar questions. It would be great to explore this more.

I am involved in a couple of NFT projects that fall under the mandate of this group. Would it be all right to present them to the group once they are solidified?  It would probably take a few months before they are ready for public eyes. However, I want to be respectful of conflict of interest and self promotion issues. My primary intention here is to collaboratively solve pressing asset management problems through blockchain technology.

<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 12 Mar 2021 15:23:14 GMT):<br/>
@malikhan -- yes, you'd be welcome to present when you're ready to.  the group already has a couple of presentations lined up and we welcome others to present as well.  just email the list with details about what you'd like to present and we can schedule a time then.  for reference, presentations are at https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/MESIG/Presentations

Hey, haven't seen much activity here. I guess it's because more members are signed up for the mailing list. But just wanted to check if there is another communication channel I am unaware of :)
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 09 Apr 2021 23:49:30 GMT):<br/>
@malikhan -- yes, more people are on the group's mailing list than here.  feel free to post there with any thoughts, comments or suggestions.
