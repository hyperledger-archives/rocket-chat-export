{"msg":"Thanks very much, Vipin and Sebastian:\n\nLet’s consider two our proposed scenarios—a Museum Network (MN) and a Commercial Network (CN). \n\nMN\nOur test-case participant is singular—the Wende Museum of the Cold War in Los Angeles \n\n1. Here’s an overview https://laacollective.org/work/cold-war-spaces-at-the-wende-museum \n2. and a 3D walkthrough of the building https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=6H92bxJF48K. \n\nI have donated my collection to them, but am taking archival responsibility for it. The museum’s goal is to display the collection while minimizing the likelihood of theft. Perhaps even loan out items (as suggested below).\n\nIndeed, if we draw a parallel with the application of blockchain to hi-resolution images in fine art museums and galleries, then it’s possible to imagine a scenario in which an entirely “audible” institution like the Grammy Museum in LA (https://grammymuseum.org/) could lend out metadata-rich files to lesser organizations, while monitoring their usage. The monitoring/resulting data would both help the museum plan more appealing exhibitions in the future and, in the case of living authors, get funds to those same authors in realtime. \n\nHence my desire to include an audio player that tracks streams, as a form of file access or “usage.” \n\nThe network in this case would be governed by the museum itself. The museum might want to host the collection on their own servers, or I could arrange a server setup with AWS or some similar cloud-based enterprise. \n\nIn the MN instance, the logical limits of a public-facing write would be crowdsourcing of historical data, with rare tracks enriched by members of the public who know the attribution of old songs. I’ve seen this work attempted by companies such as Melodiya, which used to be the primary state recording company in the Soviet Union. Their Moscow archives are a treasure trove of badly documented tapes, wax discs, acetates, cylinders, etc—often with penciled box-notes that faded in the sunlight decades ago. Melodiya started posting snippets online to see if people knew what on earth was in all those demos... https://melody.su/en/\n\n————\nCN\nHere we could split the network again into two. Let’s imagine two versions of CN:\n\n     CN1. A network run by major labels \n     CN2. A network run by minor labels—or by some regional (perhaps stylistic) team of kindred musicians. One town, one county, or one genre.\n\nIn the case of CN1 we see the type of situation that makes HLF so popular with corporations. CN1 would be for a small number of participating companies with already established artists. They collectively oversee the network, storing the files in a jointly operated cloud repo. From here files would be streamed (monitoring plays simultaneously and paying out to artists directly in real time). \n\nSo, while this would mean a reduction in percentage payments/cuts for the big labels, those companies would actually gain greater (and new) income from monitoring people/radio stations/shopping malls accessing the same files, 24/7. Artists are therefore paid more fairly by their labels—and labels are paid more fairly by the public.\n\nNo real need for a public-facing write API here, unless one wishes to let the artists update existing information.\n\n*\n\nIn the case of CN2, a more decentralized scenario transpires. No major labels—if any at all—and the artists together host their data. Here the public-facing read/write functionality is essential, since the artists record and catalog everything themselves. \n\nIf, therefore, we imagine a CN2 in which non-members are invited to join a regional or stylistically specific network, then everything would be added to that network by potential strangers. (Or by recently accepted members.) \n\nThe advantage here for CN2 is that rotation figures on Spotify are, for most artists, risible. I am not sure what happened to the project Forgotify (https://routenote.com/blog/forgotify-brings-the-unheard-music-of-spotify-to-your-ears/) but it’s currently down; it usually hosts countless tracks that have (almost) never been played on Spotify and then randomizes playlists from them. \n\nMost tracks are either never played or immediately forgotten. A local scene (“music from Pittsburgh”) or one style (“Estonian folk music”) could gather more attention and income if it broke away from the bottomless ocean of Spotify, Apple Music, etc and promoted itself to less numerous but more committed fans, claiming all income in the process. \n\nD","username":"DavidMacFadyen","ts":"2021-02-12T19:37:57.337Z"}
{"msg":"# Re/ MN\n\nFor the MN I see two use cases: \n\n1) Digital lending\n2) Decentralised curation and records management\n\nRe/ 1) Digital lending\nThe rightsholder (Wende Museum) could generate and register ISCC, and then associate metadata and licensing terms to the ISCC on the blockchain. The assets can be tokenized as fungible or non-fungible tokens.\n\nA third party curator and possible licensee could select an individual choice of content from the rightsholder collection that he wants to use for his purpose. If this purpose has been granted by the licensor as part of the licensing terms associate to the ISCC, a licensing transaction can be triggered in various ways:\n\na) The licensee could acquire a defined number of streams. In this case the number of streams / loans could be tracked by a media player or otherwise defined.\nb) The licensee could acquire a right to stream for a defined period of time. Access to the content could be granted by an application that checks verifiable credentials (VC) which have been issued by the rightsholder and licensor to the licensee after the licensing transaction. \nc) Content could be provided for research purposes according to the general academic standards.\n\nIf those models would work, this could be a valuable proof-of-concept for the entire industry and would benefit media organisations in all parts of the world. Tracking of digital lending is an issue for publishers in all parts of the world.\n\nRe/ 2) Decentralised curation and records management\nThe rightsholder (Wende Museum) could generate, register ISCC and associate metadata with the ISCC. \n\na) Third party archives and museums could do the same and identify same or similar digital assets.\nb) In case of matches, metadata could be exchanged, suggested, enriched, added, verified or corrected for quality ensurance (crowdsorcing of historic data) by verified parties.\n\n# Re/ CN\nA comment on the CN distinction. \nA closed, proprietary service with a joint fulfillment and distribution service might be hard to establish. From my conversations with the music industry and long-time collaboration with a major audio distributor, this represents the current status quo. There is not a lot of revenue to add or convenience to gain by switching an existing business to a different service that matches with the current situation.\n\nHowever, I see use cases that are of interest:\n\n- Easier access to and exchange of better metadata – this is the golden standard of problems.\n- Compensation of composers of audio works – obviously a big problem in the music industry.\n- Supporting microsales for sync licenses for social sharing – how can users legitimately license and share a lady gaga on their social media? Supporting tokenization (NFTs) for audio.\n- Supporting competition in the subscription market – How could I open up a subscription service for my customers and audience and easily get access to the licenses? (compare it to college radio stations), or think of legal, licensed music streaming in the Metaverse (Decentraland, Cryptovoxels), on Discord, on Clubhouse, Zoom, etc.\n\nIn my opinion, these use cases could – in principle – be set-up with the same technology and processes as the MN, so that structurally, eventually MN and CN might not be all too different in the basic requirements, but the use cases might be different. Especially in the expression of rights (rights expression languages REL) and the fulfillment (DRM, access control) post-transaction. \n\nBest, Sebastian","username":"sposth","ts":"2021-02-13T12:44:43.217Z"}
{"msg":"Happy Valentine’s Day to one and all!  :rose: :cupid: \n\nI have rearranged, re-edited, and simplified the project statement, increasing readability and proposing that we do everything possible to hide diverging transactions (for-profit, non-profit) behind one UI. That makes life simpler for everybody. \n\nhttps://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=41591166\n\nWe’re getting close to a small number of project sections, each associated with a specific technology. Now’ s the time to have your say!\n\nI have incorporated Sebastian’s thoughts and notes, but wonder if he’d like to suggest how much of the section “DECENTRALIZED CONTENT IDENTIFICATION. ASSOCIATION OF METADATA AND RIGHTS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION” he’d like to replace with this section from his last email?\n\nThe rightsholder (Wende Museum) could generate and register ISCC, and then associate metadata and licensing terms to the ISCC on the blockchain. The assets can be tokenized as fungible or non-fungible tokens.\n\nA third party curator and possible licensee could select an individual choice of content from the rightsholder collection that he wants to use for his purpose. If this purpose has been granted by the licensor as part of the licensing terms associate to the ISCC, a licensing transaction can be triggered in various ways:\n\na) The licensee could acquire a defined number of streams. In this case the number of streams / loans could be tracked by a media player or otherwise defined.\nb) The licensee could acquire a right to stream for a defined period of time. Access to the content could be granted by an application that checks verifiable credentials (VC) which have been issued by the rightsholder and licensor to the licensee after the licensing transaction. \nc) Content could be provided for research purposes according to the general academic standards.\n\n\nI see that people are slowly moving to the Rocket Chat at HL (https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/media-entertainment-sig)\n\nThus far, I am not sensing any real enthusiasm for moving to Slack. Let me know if that’s not the case. The benefit of some chat-space is that the emails will lessen :)","username":"DavidMacFadyen","ts":"2021-02-14T22:47:35.444Z"}

{"msg":"I am involved in a couple of NFT projects that fall under the mandate of this group. Would it be all right to present them to the group once they are solidified?  It would probably take a few months before they are ready for public eyes. However, I want to be respectful of conflict of interest and self promotion issues. My primary intention here is to collaboratively solve pressing asset management problems through blockchain technology.","username":"malikhan","ts":"2021-03-12T02:02:48.355Z"}
