You know I don't see a delete group option on telegram
</p>
<p><strong>jwhelan</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 19:37:52 GMT):<br/>
ok, I set the group to private, changed the name and left a message to come here for those who had joined
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 20:32:16 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, James!

I kinda a like brainstorming with people.  One thing I mess about Telegam was other human to chat with.

<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 22:24:17 GMT):<br/>
If we can get the other 11 people over here, that will help
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 22:24:29 GMT):<br/>
Plus the other meetup organizers around the world

Hi! I made a simple spreadsheet with the major Hyperledger topics and the different regions roughly divided by time zone. I was thinking that if you know that you or someone in your group can and is willing to speak about a topic then you can put the name of your group in the space so that people of other meetup groups know that they can contact your group for that. What do you guys think?

it's also good if we had a list of  companies who deployed Hyplerleger and had rows for Company name, contact, location, Framework, module, release date. with  links to any use case presentations and known speakers.

@tkuhrt something pinned in the file list?

@haowangbe -- this spreadsheet looks great.  thanks for putting that together and driving this.  it will be a really useful resource for organizers, i think.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 15:17:50 GMT):<br/>
in terms of pinning, i don't seem to have the access for that so we can see what @tkuhrt says about being able to do that here or not.

just pinned the message from @haowangbe 
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 15:47:07 GMT):<br/>
Also, do we want to create a folder for meetups in the Hyperledger Community folder where we can put this spreadsheet?

<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 15:47:33 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 15:56:54 GMT):<br/>
@haowangbe -- let us know if moving that file there and using that copy works for you.  if it does, i can send a note to all meetup organizers to let them know about that folder so they can start using it for hosting other files.
</p>
<p><strong>haowangbe</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 15:58:29 GMT):<br/>

About the wiki page I was wondering if it could maybe look like the other working group pages with a link to the mail archive and also a meeting / web conference now and then with the other organizers.

@tkuhrt  should the document be on a shared drive owned / controlled by Hyperleder and should their be a why we can all make edits and updates?  if so I also think a user case reference sheet would be good as well.   I can make one later this week. I think this is something meetup and ambassadors can work together on.

<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 21:01:13 GMT):<br/>
@jwhelan : This drive is owned/controlled by Hyperledger. I am the Community Architect for Hyperledger. I can definitely open this up for anyone to add files.
</p>
<p><strong>jwhelan</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 21:03:07 GMT):<br/>
yeah, I know you are. it just looked like the document pinned was haowangbe's, and the drive link was just in chat
</p>
<p><strong>jwhelan</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 21:03:07 GMT):<br/>
@DevB  can you share your SETH deep dive?
</p>
<p><strong>jwhelan</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 21:05:16 GMT):<br/>
I think if we refer people to update the pinned it might go there, and not your drive link

</p>
<p><strong>jwhelan</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 21:16:10 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt  thanks, and sorry if I'm a pain, can it be titled "Hyperledger Speaaker by topics and regions"  so when some goes to the pin its identifiable. 
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 21:17:53 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 19:18:39 GMT):<br/>
@NikolaSologub We use regular conferencing - zoom or uberconference. Live streaming is always a privacy concern. Two of our past meetups had both business and technology folks. We covered a lot of grounds on Fabric. Our next session on 29th March would actually be a deep-dive in Sawtooth-SETH. I can share the materials if you need.

Good Evening All,

My name is Rich Bloch, and I'm the organizer for the Hyperledger Seattle Meetup (HSM). David just mentioned this channel, and since I greatly prefer a chat channel to listserv any day of the week ;), I wanted to jump in and say hello to everyone.

As we just went through a reboot of HSM, I wanted to share with everyone our poll results, as they helped greatly in redefining the tenor and future direction of the meetup.

Poll results are located here (PDF): https://goo.gl/P4W6i6

Looking forward to some great discussions on this channel.

@NikolaSologub -- apologies for the delay in getting back to you.  We had a team meeting last week and I fell behind on email and chat.  Great to see you have a new meetup scheduled.  And for your question about live streaming, I think that's a great question for all the other organizers.  I suggest posting a question on the meetup mailing list -- https://lists.hyperledger.org/mailman/listinfo/hyperledger-meetups
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Wed, 28 Mar 2018 15:21:59 GMT):<br/>
@richbl -- thanks for sharing your poll results.  I think this is full of great information.  Great idea to reach out to people in your group and learn more about what they want so you can make sure they get value out of your events.  Something for all organizers to consider doing.

@davidwboswell Can we use google docs to upload the 'deep dive' presentations? 
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 15:58:27 GMT):<br/>
@michele.forbicioni Sure. Will do. I need a place to upload them to.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 15:58:50 GMT):<br/>
@DevB -- sure, would be great if you have presentations to upload.  let me get you a link.  just a second.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 16:00:04 GMT):<br/>
there's a Hyperledger Slides folder on Google Drive that you're welcome to add slides to.  that's at: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sC-YoUSzRxuKBC0uWixBKLy4H8eaqL0f
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 16:00:35 GMT):<br/>
once the slides are there, you're welcome to update the presentations page on the wiki to link to it so people can find the slides or you can send me the information and i can update the presentations wiki page.
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 17:07:23 GMT):<br/>
@davidwboswell Looks like I dont have permissions to upload. But I can upload in the speakers google drive - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WSTWQEL1U8sI5cAURb7v1tqSvg-7Dpak. 
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 17:08:11 GMT):<br/>
@DevB -- ok.  if adding to that other folder works, that's great.  or i can update permissions on the other.
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 17:12:37 GMT):<br/>
@davidwboswell They have been uploaded. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rILZl8Ur2SzqChFG9oAR2pke3al5rgRn Hopefully everything works. I will send you a summary shortly. They are very much a deep dive and may be a little challenging at times :relaxed: I can surely work with you to get it to a good shape.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 18:02:10 GMT):<br/>
@DevB -- great, thanks for posting.  you may want to share the link out with other organizers to show what you've put together and to ask for feedback and comments.

Hi fellow meetup organizers, it's Andrew here meetup host from Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. We had a wonderful kickstart last month, and we're thinking about our next meetup (May).

Good Morning David... is this morning's webinar ("Get Involved! How to get started with Hyperledger projects") open to anyone, or must the register first? It occurs to me (at a very late hour) that it'd be a great opportunity to push this to my meetup membership (albeit last minute).

Thanks

@richbl -- yes, a free registration is required for this although we'll also be sharing the recording widely afterwards.  and much of this content is now on the hyperledger website.  we just updated the community section a couple days ago.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 17 Apr 2018 15:38:34 GMT):<br/>

Hi everyone,
My name is Peter Froystad and I’m from Oslo, Norway. 
I’ve wanted for a long time to start a Hyperledger Meetup group here in Oslo, and I feel like now is the time to get started doing it. I applied today via email to meetup@hyperledger. 
I’ve witnessed the steady growth of the blockchain/DLT community here in the city, and I feel like it has come to the point that there will be enough interest for a dedicated Hyperledger community. I envision that the Hyperledger group would be tailored towards developers and other technical professionals, where we can hold presentations and workshops that help the members to work within the Hyperledger frameworks.

I think it's great that this community have started making some presentation material available, as well as tips and tricks on how to run a successful meetup-group. I think that will be very valuable :)

Cheers,
Peter
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 04 May 2018 16:35:14 GMT):<br/>
@FroystadP -- thanks for reaching out.  it will be great to get your help to bring hyperledger meetings to norway :)

@rameshjhajharia -- i've spoken with the organizers in Pune recently and they are thinking through plans but i don't think they've posted about the next meetup yet.  i would encourage you to reach them and others in Pune by posting on the discussion forum at: https://www.meetup.com/Hyperledger-Pune/discussions/  And i'll be happy to introduce you to the organizers if you'd be interested in helping them organize events there.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshjhajharia</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 06:46:58 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @davidwboswell. Sure, I would post on the forum. It would be great if you can introduce me and I would love to help them in organizing events here.

You are welcome David. Happy to help :) Let me know if I can help you with something else as well. I am getting myself familiar with Hyperledger and fabric. Should be able to help with other stuff as well soon.

ok -- i just sent an email.  if sanjay and ajay don't get back to you soon, let me know.  and that's great that you're open to contributing other ways as well.  have you looked at the contribution opportunities on the Community section of the Hyperledger site?  https://hyperledger.org/community  let me know if you have questions about anything mentioned there.
</p>
<p><strong>rameshjhajharia</strong> (Fri, 08 Jun 2018 17:28:15 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I had checked the link and have joined some workgroups and started joining meetings. Just started getting to know things and the way you guys are working. I should get clarity in next 1-2 week on what all ways I can contribute. Will ping you if I have questions.

Hi all,  I’m helping organize Hyperledger meetup in Amsterdam on June 28th and inviting everyone to join if you are nearby! 

Come spend a nice evening with fellow blockchain enthusiasts and hear our guest star, Brian Behlendorf, talk about the latest Hyperledger updates. The agenda also includes an intro to Hyperledger Fabric 1.1 with Arnaud Le Hors from IBM, and multi-host deployment of Fabric with Vitaliy Chernov from Altoros. Join us on June 28th, 6 pm, at Circl (ABN AMRO)! 
RSVP: https://www.meetup.com/Hyperledger-Amsterdam/events/251232254/

Also, I’ll appreciate if Hyperledger organizers nearby (Belgium, Germany) could kindly post a note to your groups, just in case some of your members could join us in Amsterdam. Thanks!

Hi everyone, I'm preparing the slides for the Barcelona Hyperledger meetup. Would like to mix mine with some of those I found out on Gdrive. I like this slide since I think easily helps contextualize what Hyperlegder does and status. I wonder, is there an up to date version of the same slide? @davidwboswell   Thanks!

</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Wed, 25 Jul 2018 15:14:44 GMT):<br/>
@Bobbijn -- we've collected a set of slides for meetup organizers to use that might be helpful for what you're looking for.  take a look at those at: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/community/presentations

We have now launched the new Hyperledger store and we are providing coupons to active meetup groups that can be used to order free swag to give out at your events.

* Active meetup groups (defined as a group that has held at least one meetup in the last 3 months) are eligible to receive the coupons

* Organizers can make a new request for swag each quarter

* The amount of the coupons will be based on the size of the groups ($50 for groups under 100 members, $75 for groups between 101 and 1000, and $100 for groups over 1000)

If you are interested in receiving a coupon, feel free to write me back directly.  If you have any questions about this, please respond to the list since other people may have the same question.

Thanks,
David

This is kind of reboot event so we'll meet each other, discuss topics of interest, network and have some snacks :) Speakers from MetaX will also give some insights on how blockchain and Hyperledger frameworks can be used in digital advertising.

</p>
<p><strong>benoit.razet</strong> (Wed, 01 Aug 2018 01:21:05 GMT):<br/>
the official one on the website don't fit well
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Wed, 01 Aug 2018 16:02:56 GMT):<br/>
@benoit.razet -- what sort of image are you looking for?  the sawtooth logo maybe?
</p>
<p><strong>benoit.razet</strong> (Wed, 01 Aug 2018 17:19:53 GMT):<br/>
@davidwboswell maybe some type of logo, something that would go well with he title of the meetup "Getting to Know Hyperledger Sawtooth"
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Wed, 01 Aug 2018 20:51:31 GMT):<br/>
@benoit.razet -- here's one image of the sawtooth logo.  https://www.hyperledger.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Hyperledger_Sawtooth_Logo_White.png  hope that helps.  if you need additional design help, let me know and we can talk through our options.  one idea is to post about this on the meetup organizer mailing list -- there are some people there with some good design skills.
</p>
<p><strong>benoit.razet</strong> (Wed, 01 Aug 2018 21:23:01 GMT):<br/>
@davidwboswell the meetup interface don't seem to deal well with this type of ratio height/width, but it's not too bad, I can edit it to make it more common format and it should be good. Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Wed, 01 Aug 2018 21:47:05 GMT):<br/>
@benoit.razet -- sounds good.  yeah, some editing might be necessary to fit on the meetup page.  let me know if i can help with that.  i'm not a designer but i'm OK with photoshop.

Hello, I just posted the next meetup in Barcelona. It will be on Indy / Identity management. I didn't find yet a 2nd speaker that could bring a use case to the public and that can be physically in Barcelona (but I do have someone that can join remotely). @davidwboswell  let me know if you have anyone to suggest (I already asked to the Sovrin folks). This is the link of the meetup: https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/Hyperledger-Barcelona/events/254813233/

HI David - I have a Melbourne Australia Hyperledger scheduled for 28-November 7-8pm.   Date is locked in but not up on meetup just yet.  How do I go about getting that up on hyperledger meetup?

Hi David - sorry, also meant to say that the objective of the meetup is to gain support for a regular hyperledger meetup.  Are there regular foundation updates that I can share at the meetups?

<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 09 Nov 2018 16:40:18 GMT):<br/>
@ChrisCullin -- great, glad to hear you're planning for your next event there.  To add an event, you can use this tool from the admin pages: https://www.meetup.com/Hyperledger-Melbourne/schedule/
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Fri, 09 Nov 2018 16:42:59 GMT):<br/>
Let me know if you have any questions about that.  And for regular updates, that's a good idea that we should be sending out regular news to organizers to share with their meetups.  I'd say the most recent news to share would be that the biggest Hyperledger event of the year is coming up in December and meetup attendees are eligible for a registration discount and there was recently a partnership announced between Hyperledger and EEA.  links for both are below:

Hello everyone, 

My name is Adrian and I am the founder of GST. The reason for my post is to ask for your feedback or comments on a potential collaborative project with Hyperledger and GST.

GST and Hyperledger have been collaborating on finding chapter leaders in countries where Hyperledger Meetup’s don’t exist yet.

We know a big problem for most meetup organizers is finding suitable or relevant speakers for organizing meetups in a consistent basis.

Now, we are planning on using Hyperledger Indy/SOVRIN and an ERC20 token to help solve this problem by:

Creating a list of potential blockchain speakers or ambassadors who’s skills, knowledge or expertise could be certified using Hyperledger Indy/ SOVRIN.
Each speaker will have a potential availability date and country
Use ERC20 token to crowdsource funds for travel/accommodation budget for quality speakers

I would really love to hear your thoughts on this.

Best,

I wanted to remind everyone that our first quarterly meetup best practice call with meetup.com is happening this Wednesday, March 27 at 10:00 AM Pacific.  The dial-in for that is at:

https://wework.zoom.us/j/516896901

This will be an opportunity to hear tips and suggestions about running meetups and using the meetup.com site directly from a meetup.com representative.  I'll be on the call too, so you will also have a chance to ask questions about Hyperledger or meetup.com.

If this time doesn't work for you, we'll record the call and share it out with everyone after.
</p>

If you can't make it, feel free to respond to this note with questions you have and I can ask them on the call.  The call will be recorded so you'll be able to hear answers to your questions after.

@javapriyan -- apologies for the delay in getting back to you but i was traveling last week.  we can help promote any meetups you are running on the hyperledger social media channels.  feel free to send me a link to an upcoming event and we can promote it.  and there may be other channels you can use too -- feel free to email me at dboswell@linuxfoundation.org and we can talk more about it.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 15 Apr 2019 16:33:17 GMT):<br/>
@arjanvaneersel -- glad to hear you'll be speaking about sawtooth in sofia soon.  there isn't a standard sawtooth presentation that is always used, but we do have a sawtooth presentation available if you'd like to use it.  that is at: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/events/Presentations+for+Meetups
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 15 Apr 2019 16:33:50 GMT):<br/>
note that this one may be a little out of date.  if you take a look at it and think it is too out of date, let me know and i can reach out to the sawtooth team about getting an updated version.

@davidwboswell Thanks! Those slides are a very good starting point. I'll update them and add my specific content for the workshop, which will be similar to Dan Anderson's cookiejar, except that all the code and the basic example will be in Go instead of Python, as Go makes more sense for this particular audience.

@brockhager -- thanks for reaching out.  we don't have a hyperledger Des Moines meetup group, but would be happy to work with you if you think it would be worthwhile doing that there.  the closet groups we do have are in omaha and kansas city.  if you haven't seen it already, a map of groups is at the link below.  let me know if you'd like an introduction to the organizers of those groups.  https://www.meetup.com/pro/Hyperledger/

</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Tue, 30 Jul 2019 16:14:40 GMT):<br/>
I recognize that we could organize the meet up on our own, but we are curious if there are ways that Hyperledger will support the effort, such as budget for a venue or swag.

Committed to helping advance the skills of blockchain professionals worldwide, Hyperledger provides hands-on training, professional certifications and fosters the development of free and open-source education resources by the larger Hyperledger community.

https://www.hyperledger.org/resources/training

----------------------------------------------

Hyperledger is an open-source collaborative effort created to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies. It is a global collaboration, hosted by The Linux Foundation, including leaders in finance, banking, Internet of Things, supply chains, manufacturing and Technology.

Why Create Hyperledger?
Not since the Web itself has a technology promised a broader and more fundamental revolution than blockchain technology. A blockchain is a peer-to-peer distributed ledger forged by consensus, combined with a system for “smart contracts” and other assistive technologies. Together these can be used to build a new generation of transactional applications that establishes trust, accountability, and transparency at their core while streamlining business processes and legal constraints.

Think of it as an operating system for marketplaces, data-sharing networks, micro-currencies, and decentralized digital communities. It has the potential to vastly reduce the cost and complexity of getting things done in the real world.

Only an Open Source, collaborative software development approach can ensure the transparency, longevity, interoperability, and support required to bring blockchain technologies forward to mainstream commercial adoption. That is what Hyperledger is about – communities of software developers building blockchain frameworks and platforms.

---------------------------

Thank you, looking forward to collaborative support. 
 
Regards
Prajit Datta

<p><strong>jcarpenter</strong> (Mon, 11 May 2020 15:57:14 GMT):<br/>
David, thanks for posting these.  I sent a notice out to my Meetup group.  One think I was thinking was as we share these with our local meetups, it would be good to have an easy way to translate the times into the local Meetup group time zone. Do you or the other members of the Meetup group have any thoughts around that?
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 17:01:33 GMT):<br/>
@jcarpenter -- yes, conveying the time information is a challenge.  If you have thoughts about how to do that better or know of tools, I'd be happy to try something new.  Right now I use timeanddate.com to convert start times to UTC and then I share that out.  But then that puts the burden on others to convert to their time zone.
</p>
<p><strong>jcarpenter</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 20:53:30 GMT):<br/>
@davidwboswell I was just using the UTC to Mountain Time on Google to translate the times.  I do believe posting everything with UTC really helps, I'm not aware of a solution, but it is maybe something to discuss with the Meetup sub group.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Tue, 12 May 2020 21:13:43 GMT):<br/>
Yes, happy for people to work through a better solution.  I think clearer start times would lead to more attendance.
</p>
<p><strong>jmason900</strong> (Wed, 27 May 2020 20:20:38 GMT):<br/>
@davidwboswell  @jcarpenter 
John Jordan has agreed to do a Virtual Meetup presentation on TOIP.  He and I are going to discuss details.
For me the challenge on a TOIP presentation is that it should occur in context.
The TOIP framework delivers trusted identities and relations on the Internet the same way that TLS secured messages on the Internet.
We might want to do a series of Identity presentations that puts TOIP in context.
We know between Drummond Reed and John Jordan they literally cover all of modern identity management and trust.
Your thoughts ???
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Wed, 27 May 2020 20:59:58 GMT):<br/>
@jmason900 great news about john being open to join a meetup to talk about this.  And yes, context is important.  I'm open to thoughts.  If you think we need to do other discussions first that lead to a ToIP focused meetup we could do that.

Hey Hyperledger Meetup Organizers! My name is Mike McCoy and I am the new chair of the Healthcare-Special Interest Group. I have been professionally involved in the BC space since 2016 with previous stops at ConsenSys AG and Accenture working in BC strategy, product development, competitive analysis and sales processes. Currently I am the Director of Platform Integration & Technical Partnerships at ConsenSys Health, a spin out of the ConsenSys AG venture, and I am also an Adjunct Professor at Thomas Jefferson University at The Institute of Emerging Health Professions. Local to Philadelphia, I run the Blockchain in Healthcare Today (BHTY) Philadelphia chapter, Blockchain for Social Impact and I am a part of many BC working groups. Looking forward to collaborating with you all on events, working groups and building solutions within the Hyperledger community.

For those interested in our @prasagaofficial progress on the tech side we presented to Hyperledger NYC and Denver Meetups.  Please watch the recording of the premier of ClassFungibleAsset and subclass ClassSmartAsset for enablement of Fungible and Non-Fungible Assets in our GlobalOS, XBOM a First Class Object mode on Hyperledger.  

This is a command line demo which clearly shows how blockchain advances without any smart contracts using DataGrid Token ($DGT) and wrapped ETH ($WETH) as examples.  

Again, everything works as advertised, this release is for our XBOM dev environment and enterprise TestNet for PoC.  The use cases for enterprise, the assets would be pharmaceuticals, spark pugs, bolts, coal, etc in a supply chain.

Pay Attention to the enablement of a Globally UniqueID for every account and every object.
