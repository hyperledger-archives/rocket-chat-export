I envision that the Hyperledger group would be tailored towards developers and other technical professionals, where we can hold presentations and workshops that help the members to work within the Hyperledger frameworks.\n\nI think it's great that this community have started making some presentation material available, as well as tips and tricks on how to run a successful meetup-group.

It is a global collaboration, hosted by The Linux Foundation, including leaders in finance, banking, Internet of Things, supply chains, manufacturing and Technology.\n\nWhy Create Hyperledger?\nNot since the Web itself has a technology promised a broader and more fundamental revolution than blockchain technology. A blockchain is a peer-to-peer distributed ledger forged by consensus, combined with a system for “smart contracts” and other assistive technologies. Together these can be used to build a new generation of transactional applications that establishes trust, accountability, and transparency at their core while streamlining business processes and legal constraints.\n\nThink of it as an operating system for marketplaces, data-sharing networks, micro-currencies, and decentralized digital communities. It has the potential to vastly reduce the cost and complexity of getting things done in the real world.\n\nOnly an Open Source, collaborative software development approach can ensure the transparency, longevity, interoperability, and support required to bring blockchain technologies forward to mainstream commercial adoption. That is what Hyperledger is about – communities of software developers building blockchain frameworks and platforms.\n\n---------------------------\n\nThank you, looking forward to collaborative support. \n \nRegards\nPrajit Datta","username":"PrajitDatta","ts":"2020-04-01T20:50:58.606Z"}
