What if someone doesn't have an academic reference. I have never really worked with any of professors to ask them for their recommendation. I do have a professional reference but not an academic one. Is it really necessary?

<p><strong>palash25</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 16:50:38 GMT):<br/>
Its today 23rd march. I'm guessing it will be till 12 midnight (IST)
</p>
<p><strong>myu</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 17:07:10 GMT):<br/>
@palash25 you should at least include the name/email address of a faculty member that you took a class from. We will reach out to them during review if we need additional information about you for evaluation. We will be able to get a more holistic view if we have an academic and professional contact that we could reach out to. 
</p>
<p><strong>palash25</strong> (Fri, 23 Mar 2018 17:07:58 GMT):<br/>
I can think of one professor. Fine I will include his details.

 Hi, I am new to this chat and Hyperledger.
Are there any coders and UI Developers interested to collaborate on an exciting project?
I have entire business logic but need help with coding and making a functional UI, as first step. Any suggestions are most welcome. Thanks.

@rjones @tkuhrt if interns want to participate in the Hyperledger Global Forum
1) Do they follow the standard CFP submission process?
2) Will LF pay for their travel / lodging if their talk is accepted?
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 09 Jul 2018 18:30:08 GMT):<br/>
@sheehan : More details here: https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/hyperledger-global-forum-2018/program/cfp/

</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 09 Jul 2018 18:31:11 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 09 Jul 2018 18:32:04 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 09 Jul 2018 18:48:20 GMT):<br/>
Okay...I checked in with our events folks. @sheehan please have the intern follow the standard process and in addition send me a note so that I can make sure that we flag it as an intern-submitted talk.

<p><strong>myu</strong> (Tue, 10 Jul 2018 13:46:00 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog this is not a Linux Foundation or Hyperledger sponsored blockchain training course...I am not sure if we can support him financially, if that's the question.

Hello. Can I apply for a project if I only possess required 'Skills' or should I also be competent enough to implement the project requirements and achieve the expected outcome? I find most of the skills required already being possessed or can be acquired within the time available before the internship period, but not knowledgeable on how to specifically apply those skills to achieve the expected outcome. Can I still apply? Will I be guided for the same, during the internship?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Sat, 30 Mar 2019 07:03:32 GMT):<br/>
@sebtowin As a general rule I've found it's always best to apply even if I don't have all the skills and to let the interviewers decide if I'm qualified rather than eliminating myself from the selection pool early. With that said, I think you should definitely apply.

@TheAlgo not sure what you mean. CV is normally project independant

<p><strong>TheAlgo</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 05:55:03 GMT):<br/>
No its written that in the cover letter you need to mention why are you interested in the selected projects , and how much your skills are relevant, so that is  the reason I was asking whether I should mention all the 4 projects that I have selected
</p>
<p><strong>TejasKotha</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 08:14:32 GMT):<br/>
I think what @TheAlgo wants to know is that if we need to cover all the four projects in a single cover letter.

Yeah even i was wondering like suppose i am interested in a project and it requires skills such as a programming language, and the project is related to a hyperledger project and i don't have both in resume, so what should i write?
</p>
<p><strong>nanspro</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 19:17:20 GMT):<br/>
I learned the language ,and read, and understood the related hyperledger project during this one month preparation and i have good background, interest in the project
</p>
<p><strong>nanspro</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 19:20:26 GMT):<br/>
But i won't be able to provide work samples directly related to some of the skills necessary for the project
</p>
<p><strong>TheAlgo</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 19:44:55 GMT):<br/>
And The cover letter is specifically asking for the interests so accordingly we should write why we choose all the four projects , is it like that?

@aniketsingh03 No specific requirement on word limit on cover letter. But I would recommend to conform to the regular length of a cover letter, like 1-2 pages.
</p>
<p><strong>TheAlgo</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 20:44:04 GMT):<br/>
And do we need to mention about all the 4 projects ? @myu 
</p>
<p><strong>myu</strong> (Fri, 12 Apr 2019 21:19:45 GMT):<br/>
@TheAlgo I think if you could address how your experience and background would be applicable to the projects you're applying for in cover letter that would be great. I recommend that you really dig into the details of the project, select and focus your cover letter on 2. Of course, you do have the option to apply up to 4, if you wish. Also, in your cover letter, we really want to see that you're an applicant who is passionate about becoming an active contributor  in the Hyperledger open source community through this internship experience.

For my project, my mentors has been contacting through mails. It would be easier if we can use a private channel. I asked on the general channel, there  people are saying that's not possible.
</p>
<p><strong>harsh-98</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 16:59:37 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>burdettadam</strong> (Tue, 02 Jul 2019 22:27:23 GMT):<br/>
@harsh-98 I recognized the same problem, the need for collaboration channel for a small group around a single project. To address this need I created a child wiki page of the project for collaboration https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Collaboration%3A+Raspberry+Pi+Indy+Agent.  The page I created will most likely become documentation. Yours could include questions that anyone in the group can answer where you directly message others as needed.

Hi everyone! I'm working on Sawtooth Explorer. I'm implementing the feature of configurable decoding: I already have protos uploading and configuring the rules to choose which message to apply -- I tested it with Sawtooth Marketplace -- and currently was trying to test other decoding options, but the Sawtooth XO validator doesn't seem to listen on tcp://localhost:4040, it doesn't respond to subscription requests from my explorer's backend. Marketplace's validator does. localhost:8008/state works nice, xo create/take from shell container works too.
```vlad@Xiaomi:~$ sudo netstat -ntlp | grep LISTEN
...
tcp6       0      0 :::4004                 :::*                    LISTEN      13585/docker-proxy

Can anybody suggest something?

Hi there Shivam here.
An active contributor for Chromium and Mozilla. I have experience in C/Cpp/Python development.
I have also read the docs and implemented some blockchains (just a beginner in this though) but I see we have some very good projects of compiler designing which I can use my experience and make some contributions to.
Looking forward towards it.
</p>

<p><strong>viragumathe5</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 19:30:14 GMT):<br/>
I was really want to work under "Build a university course on Hyperledger Fabric using Hyperledger Umbra" and so few days back I started looking for the designing of the courses and all I have done some work on it. 
So basically we can divide the whole project into some important parts to design the course which are as follows
1. Course Designing
2. Writing Syllabus
3. Delivering the content 
And inside these 3 designing parameters we will add some educational elements to easy building the project

Course Designing
1. Principles
2. Who are the Students
3. Constraints in course
4. Objective of studies
5. Assessment and its different types  
6. Instruction strategies
7. Course content and Schedule

 Writing Syllabus
1. Writing Syllabus for the new course
2. Revise the new syllabus
3. Continuously Improving the syllabus
</p>
<p><strong>viragumathe5</strong> (Wed, 25 Mar 2020 19:37:05 GMT):<br/>
Writing Syllabus
4. Objectives
5. Deliverables of the course


Delivering the content 
1. Instructional Strategies (Notes, Videos, Self discussion labs, etc)
2 Problematic student feedback
3. Student support system


I have created this structure from different sources but if Hyperledger have their own template for the course then I am flexible and would work on it 
As there is no current repository provided at idea pages so I would like to create the local repository to start work and start adding patches to it and posting the link here soon 

Thank You
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 15:05:26 GMT):<br/>
@viragumathe5 I encourage you to apply for this internship. I appreciate your enthusiasm. What you've posted here is almost exactly what I was thinking when I wrote the proposal. The term "classroom-in-a-box" means that the output from this project should be a complete course that fits into a single university term and provides lecture notes, lessons, lab experiments, quizzes and tests.
</p>
<p><strong>viragumathe5</strong> (Fri, 27 Mar 2020 06:54:27 GMT):<br/>
Thank You so much @dhuseby  I am really interested in this opportunity and will give my best. So right now I am contributing to the fabric-sdk-py and getting familiar with codebase and documentation 
And simultaneously I have created the local repository for continuous improvement in the content for the university course. I just want to ask you hay is there anny procedural that I must follow. Secondary which approach should I follow to proceed. 

Thank You
</p>
<p><strong>viragumathe5</strong> (Fri, 27 Mar 2020 08:11:04 GMT):<br/>
I have created the Repository and initiated it with the course outline 
https://github.com/viragumathe5/Hyperledger-Fabric-University-Program  
</p>
<p><strong>viragumathe5</strong> (Fri, 27 Mar 2020 12:34:13 GMT):<br/>
@dhuseby I have created the syllabus outline for the course and till now I really have less knowledge about the students and other thing so I have added some important thing to get started by student(As we don't know about the students yet so I had added the element for Blockchain and then started with Hyperledger Fabric)
Please see the link https://github.com/viragumathe5/Hyperledger-Fabric-University-Program/blob/master/Syllabus%20outline.md for syllabus outline 
  
It is written in the How to get head start guide to Reach out to mentor(s) to schedule meetings. for communication purpose and for creating healthy relationship with mentor so please guide me over it.
Can we discuss about the deliverable from the course and the which pattern this course will follow so that I can give my thought over it for the next steps like designing the lab materials and lab tasks for the students 
</p>
<p><strong>viragumathe5</strong> (Fri, 27 Mar 2020 12:41:18 GMT):<br/>
I have also look for the certification essentials while creating the syllabus and out of which some are not get covered in the delivered syllabus I am improving the syllabus. and on it for work

Hello, myself Rajat Kumar Undergrad from MNNIT Allahabad India. I heard about the mentorship program and I am very much interested to participate in it. I am an Android Developer and contributing to the same open source-based project. I don't know much about the blockchain but I have a keen interest to learn and develop. I want to know what are the pre-requisite that I should follow to apply for this program and start able to contribute before the deadline.

Hi Min, I also looked at the problem before, but I found that after I uploaded files it only shows `in progress` and for `submitted` I can manually click the dropdown and select `submitted` but I am not sure whether the file has successfully been uploaded or not.

@dhuseby , @myu  and other admins Can I ask you, what other things besides provided questions in internship page should I add in the cover letter so it will make my cover letter more unique, to the point and make my way towards selection more clear ?????

@dexhunter and @Lucas-Wye  there was a bug with the application tool. And it has been fixed. An email notification should have been sent to you by now. Please re-submit your cover letter/resume/proof of enrollment. Once done, mark it as submitted. Thank you!

<p><strong>sumaids</strong> (Sat, 04 Apr 2020 10:33:47 GMT):<br/>
@viragumathe5  You need to submit resume as well right?
Resume + cover letter should be enough to show your skills.
</p>
<p><strong>viragumathe5</strong> (Sat, 04 Apr 2020 15:23:46 GMT):<br/>
Ok @sumaids thank you so much.

<p><strong>myu</strong> (Fri, 10 Apr 2020 15:10:12 GMT):<br/>
@hauturier Once you select the Hyperledger projects to apply, you should get email notification to complete application prerequisites (resume, cover letter, and etc.). Then upload them and mark those prerequisite tasks as "submitted". Then we will be able to see your application materials. Reach out if you have further questions.

Hi @myu, do you recommend adding anything else in the cover letter apart from the questions asked in the task ?
</p>
<p><strong>myu</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 19:44:35 GMT):<br/>
@HritikGupta I think addressing the questions asked is sufficient but be sure to personalize it to the project(s) you're applying and highlight experiences that make you a qualified candidate.
</p>
<p><strong>myu</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 19:52:15 GMT):<br/>
@all  just a reminder that we will be closing the student intern application for this year's mentorship program next Friday, April 24th. Please remember to apply and complete the application prerequisite tasks (resume/cover letter/proof of enrollment) before the deadline. Please help us spread the word in your network about this great opportunity - remote, paid, hands-on learning, and mentorship from experienced developers in blockchain and DLT technologies to guide you towards contribution to open source projects.

<p><strong>HritikGupta</strong> (Mon, 20 Apr 2020 10:33:18 GMT):<br/>
@DhirajSharma8 you'll have to complete the task you might have received after you start the application for a project. this entails writing a cover letter and submitting resume
</p>
<p><strong>DhirajSharma8</strong> (Mon, 20 Apr 2020 11:56:40 GMT):<br/>

Hello all! after uploading the files my dashboard block changes from "pending" to "submitted" almost like in a SCRUM manner. But it is mentionaing "Application Pending" despite showing "submitted" in the files section. Is it normal? Can anyone also please share the screenshot of their application portal of how it would look like thanks!!

Your application tasks should show "submitted" if the upload of cover letter/resume is successful, but your overall status will still show "pending" because we haven't made any decision on your application.

@viragumathe5 the review process is completed. We're sending acceptance notification this week. If you haven't heard from mentors or gotten the acceptance notification by early next week that means you are not selected. You should then consider applying for other projects hosted on CommunityBridge.

Hi Ayudhridhar! Mentorship 2022 is happening and details should be announced in January. As far as potential projects, you can check out the individual project chat channels here or get up to speed via the wiki (https://wiki.hyperledger.org/)  or github (https://github.com/hyperledger). We don't have Mentor Project Proposals yet, but they will have a direct connection or relevance to an existing Hyperledger project or lab
