Hi all, it is really good that this work is beginning... As a food for thought that is hopefully interesting to people here, here's an overview of research we did on fabric 0.6 (funded by a 2016 IBM Faculty Award, granted to Prof. Pataricza, my research group leader): https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_R1w6XGVPqXYXAzYjJfTVFuLWs/view?usp=drivesdk We found interesting things - obviously the whole exercise should be repeated for fabric 1.0; but a (negative) result was that the whole activity is somewhat academic without broadly-accepted, Blockchain-specific performance concepts/metrics and representative workloads (aka a proper benchmark definition). And this seems to be pretty much in line with Mark's invitation to the telco, so I'm eager to hear about your view on performance and scalability today.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 02:41:05 GMT):<br/>
interesting work @ikocsis , and i would like to suggest add the latency as perf indicator, as many real scenarios care about it. e.g., latency before the tx is broadcasted, latency before final commitment, etc..
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 02:41:05 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 02:42:29 GMT):<br/>
And also, the gRPC part is NOT "surprisingly" slow :)
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 06:47:35 GMT):<br/>
Hmm... could you elaborate? We were (and still are) rather inexperienced in gRPC. That said, my expectation was that RPC should not have such an overhead, especially in scenarios where communication is essentially in-memory. We did play with the idea of properly tracing at least a few gRPC calls, but in the end did not have the time.
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 09:35:43 GMT):<br/>
Sorry, I failed to reply to the first part (I'm at a conference) @baohua , in my view the metrics you mentioned are super-important for performance analysis (and we definitely didn't have/had a full coverage) - but are essentially application-internal. Meaning that the clients (in the Hyperledger fabric sense) don't see them directly and most probably don't care about. What they see directly (for fabric 0.6 and with oversimplification) are a) the qualities of the synchronous operation of submitting a Tx request, b) the qualities of the asynchronous operation of fulfilling that request (or not). So my feeling is that the "service level performance and scalability metrics", if you like, should be treated separately from the "internal metrics". All the more so that the first group is what is potentially comparable across tools, configurations and tool versions.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 24 May 2017 13:01:03 GMT):<br/>
@ikocsis Thanks for ur reply, ikocis, yes, I understand your initial goals. I agree that we may separate those metrics into different folds, like from the end users's perspective, from the developers perspective. I guess you may know the flaming graph in the system perf area. While in the distributed system, what we may more care about is the network performance, rather than the node processing. Hence I would suggest we can also try to classify the metrics into like networking part (latency, throughput, etc.), node processing part (txs, time, etc.), and also the whole system part, to give people some full but quick picture on how well fabric would work :)

<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 14:12:58 GMT):<br/>
sorry, I thought that we were waiting for the results of the doodle poll
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Wed, 07 Jun 2017 23:12:10 GMT):<br/>
As of now, we have 13 responses (of the 49 people who have joined this channel).  Of those, 9 people have agreed that TUE 9:00 AM – 10:00 AM Eastern works for them.  Last call for people who want to participate in this poll:  https://beta.doodle.com/poll/hcthgi9v45mmmsmu#calendar.  @mwagner : should we close the poll at the end of the week, and set up bi-weekly calls starting next week?
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 13:51:28 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt those were my thoughts as well. Can you send a final reminder ?  Also  if there is a "general" hyperledger email list can you cc that email list as well?

</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 14:00:51 GMT):<br/>
I need to update the charter to have a broader scope as discussed in Washington
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 14:01:36 GMT):<br/>
I unfortunately will not be in Beijing so I can't attend the F2F, can you appoint someone to take notes ?
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 14:03:57 GMT):<br/>
Also, looking to move the call to the 27th since folks will be in Beijing and the meeting after that falls on July 4th which is a big US Holiday
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 14:24:05 GMT):<br/>
aha, understand.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 14:24:54 GMT):<br/>
i will try to see if we can collect some comments for the pswg, and will post to the mail-list.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 14:25:09 GMT):<br/>
timezone is definitely big problem for collaborations :)
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 14:25:31 GMT):<br/>
even we have so powerful internet...
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 14:26:20 GMT):<br/>
yes, btw I can join a call to be involved in the Beijing discussions if that is feasible to get setup
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 14:27:55 GMT):<br/>
aha, this is good idea, i will see if we can have some hackfest call during the event, but i guess it's difficult to setup a call. a online chat might be possible. maybe we can use the #twg-china channel for the hackfest online discussions.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 15 Jun 2017 14:28:40 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 11:26:49 GMT):<br/>
really quite lots of questions, mostly focus on the tps evaluation results on fabric and how to make a scale deployment for production scenarios. 
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 11:59:19 GMT):<br/>
" mostly focus on the tps evaluation results on fabric and how to make a scale deployment for production scenarios" --> I would really appreciate some more detail, if possible, that's interesting for us, too (and I assume not all people looking to participate in the PSWG had the chance to attend in Beijing)
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 11:59:58 GMT):<br/>
and sorry for the question about the next meeting, I seem to have stopped receiving mails from the list weeks ago, really strange
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 18:16:55 GMT):<br/>
@ikocsis : The next meeting for PSWG is on January 27th (9-10am EDT) at https://www.uberconference.com/hyperledger-community
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 19:12:10 GMT):<br/>
@ikocsis not sure why you aren't getting emails, while the list is low volume at the moment, there have been multiple emails in the last week
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 19:12:22 GMT):<br/>
perhaps you should sign up again ?
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 19:56:33 GMT):<br/>
@mwagner, thanks, already did that, received yesterday's digest - so it seems to work now, hopefully remains so.
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 20 Jun 2017 20:12:17 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt: thanks! @mwagner: next Tuesday I hold a course, I asked a colleague of mine, László Gönczy to sit in for me this time. He's also involved in our Blockchain performance activities, teaches such stuff and is a Hyperledger Summer Internship mentor (https://wiki.hyperledger.org/internship/project_ideas, project 2).
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 21 Jun 2017 06:27:18 GMT):<br/>
@ikocsis i understand, and i've also help announce the establishment at the hackfest, and encourage people to join the next meeting. I will try to present and share what i was asked and the thoughts.

Hi, can anyone point me to some performance benchmark numbers for Hyperledger Fabric?    I also am looking for any information regarding testing that is done where a large number of peers may be disconnected for an hour or more and then brought back on line.

</p>
<p><strong>tennenjl</strong> (Mon, 26 Jun 2017 14:07:43 GMT):<br/>
@mwagner Thanks, even if this is 0.6 it's better than anything I have now. :-)

@chenxuan What were the number of peers (endorsers and orderers) for these transactions
</p>
<p><strong>chenxuan</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 14:14:18 GMT):<br/>
2 peer 1 orderer base on the kafka
</p>
<p><strong>chenxuan</strong> (Tue, 27 Jun 2017 14:14:27 GMT):<br/>
the kafka is fake cluster

<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:40:49 GMT):<br/>
Hi Mark
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:41:06 GMT):<br/>
sorry to hear about your teeth, best wishes
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:41:39 GMT):<br/>
Marta Piekarska was in the call to check in on the WG
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:42:08 GMT):<br/>
The Caliper guys presented their proposal again (many, including me, were not present last time)
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:43:03 GMT):<br/>
Marta directed them towards the Requirements WG, where representative use cases are supposedly coming along nicely
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:43:35 GMT):<br/>
Kent (?) and Alex (?) were also there
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:44:13 GMT):<br/>
The Caliper guys basically asked for the results of this WG so that they can incorporate them in their tool
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:45:07 GMT):<br/>
I suggested to them to share what they have as a metric-set set now and promised to share my personal very rough draft (see my mail to the list)
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:45:52 GMT):<br/>
It came up whether we should begin to discuss the dictionary, but there was no sense to do that in the remaining 10 minutes
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:46:02 GMT):<br/>
Basically this
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:48:10 GMT):<br/>
My personal opinion: it's very good that Caliper is being developed (we may have a student who will begin to kick its tires in a few weeks), but the lines between the PSWG and Caliper seem to be rather blurry
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:51:02 GMT):<br/>
I had a look at the PSWG dictionary document and will share my (uninvited) view on it (again) in a few minutes. There are some good things in there, but in my opinion this should be definitely discussed next time (maybe even earlier?).
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:52:24 GMT):<br/>
Also: Marta and the Caliper guys talked about a face to face between them and the req guys (and also for PSWG? sorry, I don't remember) in Chicago.
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 14:55:07 GMT):<br/>
thanks!  btw you comments on the dictionary are not only invited but encouraged! 
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 15:02:23 GMT):<br/>
ok, thanks :)
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 15:05:13 GMT):<br/>
Hopefully, the Caliper guys will also share something, although they didn't really commit themselves
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 15:07:35 GMT):<br/>
And I went through the little available material on Blockchain benchmarking - no classic metric/quality aspect analysis anywhere (although from the software point of view, some impressive contributions)
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Wed, 23 Aug 2017 15:07:36 GMT):<br/>
So one question: do you/we have any "representative" use cases by now?

<p><strong>Haojun</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 02:42:43 GMT):<br/>
Hi ikocsis, in fact we have already added some definitions in the dictionary directly, not using comments. Please check version on Aug 23 :grinning: 
</p>
<p><strong>Haojun</strong> (Sat, 26 Aug 2017 02:56:44 GMT):<br/>
As discussed on the TSC meeting, Caliper should only provide tools, no test results should be provided in the project as official testing. And the definition of performance metrics and use cases should be discussed in PSWG,  that helps us to focus our discussion in one place. So Caliper now mainly focuses on the developing of the architecture and functionality, integrating more blockchain systems, etc,  and we will continues to contribute to the PSWG. I hope that would help to clarify the line between the PSWG and Caliper .
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 13:29:01 GMT):<br/>
@Haojun How can I become more involved with Caliper ?
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 16:11:41 GMT):<br/>
Hi Haojun, thanks for the clarification, for whatever reason my impression was slightly different based on my skim of the project proposal document. Regarding version august 23: I think I even commented on that part.
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Mon, 28 Aug 2017 16:18:24 GMT):<br/>
@mwagner : I stumbled upon this today: http://www.chainthat.com/updates/2017/7/5/using-hyperledger-fabric-v1-in-reinsurance I don't know whether they are already involved in the work of the requirements WG. It could be a good idea to reach out to them whether they want to/could support PSWG with their use case. Their solution seems to be at least reasonably mature and publishing that shows openness.

@mwagner Currently, you can create github issues if you have any comments, ideas or bug fixes. If the project is approved, we could start a new rocket channel. Anyway, you can always reach me by email .

it seems you limited the send rate to 100 tps,  you can try to improve the number until the avg throughput reaches the upper limit
</p>
<p><strong>dinesh.rivankar</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 06:07:14 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @Haojun... Should we do this test on different distributed systems or on a single system using docker ? Also when we have different combination of send rate the code breaks with error: Invoke chaincode failed, Error: Failed to send Proposal or receive valid response. Response null or status is not 200. exiting...  at channel.sendTransactionProposal.then (/caliper/src/fabric/e2eUtils.js:614:10)

<p><strong>Haojun</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 06:24:40 GMT):<br/>
That depends on your test purpose. A distributed systems should get better performance result than deploying all peers on the same host. Could you send me your configuration file @dinesh.rivankar ? It seems the proposal is rejected by endorsers. 
</p>
<p><strong>Haojun</strong> (Tue, 05 Sep 2017 06:37:02 GMT):<br/>
Another possibility is that the client did not get the response in time (there is a 60s timeout for request). How many clients are you using? Check the cpu percentage of node process, if it's too high, try to add more clients

@dinesh.rivankar  I can not reproduce the failure...... so 
1. use 'top' to check if the node process is too busy as i suggested before. If your vm is too limited to run all the clients and fabric peers, try to test on a distributed system. I guess that's the main problem.
2. you can try to increase the 'request-timeout' value, which is in the first line of getcontext function in e2eUtils.js line 393
3. there is a bug to handle the error message which caused the query test failed when querying a nonexistent item. Thanks for the test. I will fix it later, you can create a issue on github if you want
</p>

Hi @Haojun , i am trying to run the caliper benchmark test. I have set up 4 different peers on 4 separate VM's in docker containers. I am not able to monitor the stats for remote docker containers. Getting following error: "Failed to read monitoring data".
</p>
<p><strong>Haojun</strong> (Fri, 08 Sep 2017 05:59:37 GMT):<br/>
@niteshsolanki , how do you define the container in the configuration file? Can you fetch the remote container's data using curl? Docker Remote API must be enabled with those docker service, which is usually disabled by default.
</p>
<p><strong>niteshsolanki</strong> (Fri, 08 Sep 2017 06:00:22 GMT):<br/>
@Haojun it worked now :-) i was not specifying the correct container ID. thanks for response

</p>
<p><strong>niteshsolanki</strong> (Mon, 11 Sep 2017 09:18:32 GMT):<br/>
@harsha 4 peers, 1 orderer, 2 CAs

Hi everyone, I am new to hyperledger and had some performance related questions I am hoping you can answer or point me in the right direction. My first question is what is the complexity of reading blocks from the blockchain. My second question is if the structure of chaining blocks or grouping them into channels provide faster access to the underlying data. Any guidance is appreciated!

</p>
<p><strong>niteshsolanki</strong> (Tue, 19 Sep 2017 09:03:47 GMT):<br/>
@thakkarparth007 
request/s= rate at which the transactions were sent by client per sec
tx/s= number of transactions that got committed successfully per sec

Hello, I have been conducting scalability tests on Hyperledger Fabric 1.0.3 where I try to define how TPS and time spent on certain components in the network differ as I increase the number of endorsers. I have came up with some results until now, however there is something strange that I cannot really understand. When a transaction proposal is sent to the peers in parallel, the peers should simulate the transaction and respond back to the client from my understanding. If this is the case all of the endorsing peers should do this in parallel and the total time of client -> peer -> client should not change dramatically when I increase the number of endorsing peers. In my tests I have seen that this time increases linearly inside the peers. Has anyone did such a performance/scalability test or know why this is the case? Sorry for the really long question.

@FiratSertgoz I'm interested in this linear relationship you describe. Are you running the peers across a true decentralised architecture or are they all on the same infrastructure instance? If it is the latter you can imagine how you might get a sort of linear performance curve as the parallelism you are testing is not physical.

Guys, I 've trying to have a blockchain based on composer model. But I 'm seeing a performance dip of 30-40% when using composer to deploy my blockchain vs directly deploying my chaincode and use native sdk to invoke the chaincode. Is that kind of performance penalty expected with composer?

<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 10:23:32 GMT):<br/>
Hi team, I want some generic guidelines in increasing the performance.. of fabric blockchain. 

I 've tried scaling the peers vertically and horizontally and also tried to scaling the orderer service horizontally.. but I 'm not able to cross a 80 TPS even with 10 peers. I 'm able to get about 55-60 TPS from 1 peer (c4.2x large and 2000 IOPS SSD disks), but with 10 peers the performance didn't increase much. 

What are the things I can look for? I 'm using c4 type instances on AWS and ELB for load-balancing the requests from my web application to orderer and fabric peers. 
</p>
<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 10:25:06 GMT):<br/>
Loadbalacing the traffic from applications to all peers should increase the performance or I should only send to few peers and other peers would just replicate the blocks. Same goes for orderer, I 'm using kafka based orderer. 
</p>
<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Fri, 19 Jan 2018 10:29:15 GMT):<br/>
I 'm worried for the fact that my chaincode is very simple at the moment doing a simple asset transfer, when I build on that more complex logic. The performance could get a serious hit. My aim is to at least reach 500 TPS.

@AshishMishra 1 Hi ashish. Even i am fiddling around the performance issues. I am not even getting 10 TPS using just 2 orgs with 2 peers each. Could you pls help me sharing your network configuration. Are you trying on multihost environment using cello or locally? are you using node-sdk to invoke and query? and what are the docker-compose files u r using for orderer, peer and CA
</p>
<p><strong>AshishMishra 1</strong> (Tue, 23 Jan 2018 11:55:52 GMT):<br/>
@javrevasandeep , I 'm using multihost enviroement with the with 1 org, a kafka based orderer service and 2 orderer containers and 3-4 peers. I 've basically split the compose file and execute them separately , which comes with the sample projects. 
</p>
<p><strong>javrevasandeep</strong> (Tue, 23 Jan 2018 13:44:56 GMT):<br/>

Hello All, I was doing a load test on my application with Node SDK as the front end and CouchDB as World state. While doing it, I found that the getState takes about 10~15 times (approx) more than the putState operation. Although it is in milliseconds, I am still curious to know why is there such a big difference. I took the difference in times in the logs in the peer logs to obtain the result. Thank you. :)

Hello to everybody! I'm doing some performances test on hyperledger fabric.
I tried to execute the same sequence of writing operations on a multi organization, single channel blockchain. Operations executed using command line interface.
I modified the endorsement policies with 2 configurations:
1) AND(org1MSP.member,org2MSP.member, ... , orgNMSP.member)
2) OR (org1MSP.member,org2MSP.member, ... , orgNMSP.member)

All the operations conducted with first endorsement policy (*AND*) required *less time* (about 20%) than the operations with OR.
I measured the time requried with _time_ command of bash.
If AND requires the endorsement of at least one member of all organizations, why did it required less time? thanks in advance.

<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 18:10:40 GMT):<br/>
With respect to this whole throughput vs goodput, would it make sense to indicate that both need to be measured?  Generally goodput is what users think of when characterizing throughput.  However some systems may not have a linear relationship between throughput and goodput.  Imagine that as a system gets more heavily loaded, while it's throughput may go up linearly, it's goodput may not.  This is especially true as systems are driven into overload conditions.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 18:13:15 GMT):<br/>
Would it make sense to suggest that throughput must always include the breakdown of transactions with respect to successful or not?  How many were dropped because the messages were malformed.  How many were dropped because of other protocol errors (sequence, whatever),  How many were not processed because of timeouts due to overloading?  How many failed due to failed logic checks such as transferring more money than I have or selling something I don't own?

yes I think that all makes sense to describe in the workload section. 
I think its important that we report TPS as goodput. Otherwise a system that is failing horribly will show very high numbers which would convey entirely the wrong result.

This working group is geared more towards defining what performance means for blockchain. Actual tuning and deployment guidelines are the purview of each of the projects like #sawtooth, #burrow, #fabric, #iroha. 
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Sun, 18 Mar 2018 23:22:18 GMT):<br/>
@sillysachin While @Dan is completely right, I'd just like to point out that 10k Tx/day translates to ~7 Tx/min, if I'm right (and I know that we are not accounting for the intra-day bursts here) - to the best of my knowledge, that's trivial for all Blockchain techs in Hyperledger. Should be completely doable with fabric, or even Composer + fabric on reasonable hardware. Actually - this should be a trivial load for any permissioned Blockchain. (Modulo smart contract complexity, certainly.)
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Sun, 18 Mar 2018 23:45:59 GMT):<br/>

1. for hyperledger fabric kafka-Orderer base consensus, what is scalability concept definition.
2. I got info from this resource http://www.oodlestechnologies.com/blogs/Scaling-Up-The-Hyperledger-Fabric
Is that true that,  adding new Org is the way to scale the system, 
3. What is the problem need to be solved regarding scalability aspect, I mean, when system get scaled which is the benefit 
4. How to evaluate the scalabiity of the system

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/performance-and-scale-wg?msg=kK4oGSTybbXavKLfY) @Ryan2 One way it is defined in the blockbench paper to measure the change in throughput as network size increases. In case of fabric it will be only the peers participating in the ordering service (Kafka + OSN nodes). ZK nodes are mainly for fault tolerance (high availability). 

Ref: http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ooibc/blockbench.pdf (note that they have analyzed v0.6 and not v1.0+ which are very different architectures.

<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 01:02:02 GMT):<br/>
@Dan I'm still trying to figure out what you're trying to capture with the blockchain work metric.  Is this a measure of the work (computing resources?) consumed by the blockchain?  You say "provides meaningful characterization of blockchain performance rather than database performance.", but I'm not sure what that means.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 01:03:14 GMT):<br/>
@Dan What is the relationship between a blockchain of 1 node handling 1,000 tps and a 1,000 node blockchain handling 1 tps?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 01:12:08 GMT):<br/>
Hi @toddinpal we had our first discussion about that last tuesday so it's pretty early thinking. I'm looking for something that relates the size of the network with the throughput. Where size is intended to proxy the availability and integrity guarantees of the system. 
For example a single validator with high throughput does not offer any availability or integrity benefit over a traditional database.
In contrast, ethereum mainnet with thousands (?) of validating nodes participating in consensus has very high integrity and availability but relatively low throughput.
Your example points out this is not real useful expressed as a simple product. A different(?) Todd said he'd put some thought into a way of expressing that relationship. 
I think in an earlier discussion I had suggested a metric like [blockchain work @ network size] with the downside that you are back to showing two numbers which may be confusing.
I think [other] Todd suggested a slope might be useful. But then we would probably need to specify the range for computing the slope. 
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 01:12:46 GMT):<br/>
I am the other Todd... :-)
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 01:12:54 GMT):<br/>
lol :D
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 01:13:17 GMT):<br/>
You are trying to trick me into helping with your homework :P
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 01:13:25 GMT):<br/>
lol
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 01:13:45 GMT):<br/>
So why don't we add metrics for availability and integrity?
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 01:13:57 GMT):<br/>
Then we can relate throughput more directly
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 01:14:49 GMT):<br/>
I'm thinking in a partitioned scheme, increasing nodes (partitions) doesn't increase availability, and probably not integrity
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 01:15:09 GMT):<br/>
OK, I'll do my homework....  :-)

Hi folks. I perform load testing for Hyperledger Fabric and Composer. I faced with degrading of latency near the 70 rps to the blockchain state (CouchDB). You can find more information here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49875309/attempt-to-achieve-high-throughput-in-hyperledger-fabric-network. Please add a comment on StackOverflow if you have any thoughts or ideas. Thanks!

Do we want to have a section in the document that addresses performance in light of infrastructure characteristics?  So packet loss or latency impacts performance in this manner.  Or my nodes are really cheap but not so reliable, how does their failure rate impact performance or availability?

<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 18:06:10 GMT):<br/>
I know I've mentioned this before, but have we looked at what other organizations have done around defining performance and scalability?  I'm thinking of things like TPC which I'm quite familiar with, but I know there are others such as SPEC.  I know we've been shying away from defining benchmarks, but those organizations may have valuable information/background for us.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Tue, 24 Apr 2018 18:07:32 GMT):<br/>
And I guess a related question is:  Do we think we should be defining those sorts of benchmarks?

</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 14:13:48 GMT):<br/>
So I believe the issue we need to deal with is how does finality relate to transaction throughput and latency
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 14:15:17 GMT):<br/>
and this is related to the goodput notion...  Does it make sense to consider transactions that aren't final or transactions that may fail validation as part of the calculations for throughput and latency?
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 14:19:49 GMT):<br/>
Some real world examples:  In Fabric, a poorly designed smart contract may cause most transactions to be endorsed, but fail validation as they all try to modify the same key.  So 100 transactions may be submitted and successfully endorsed in one second, yet 99 of them are invalidated due to MVCC.  Clearly a transaction throughput of 100/sec isn't correct.  Likewise in PoW systems, 100 transactions may be submitted and committed in one second, yet be rolledback 5 minutes later.  What is the throughput then?
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 14:21:21 GMT):<br/>
Do we attempt to graph these relationships?  If so, it is a multidimensional graph with the number of axes greater than 3, ugh.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 14:24:25 GMT):<br/>
Personally I think if we want to strive for a single number, we only consider transactions that are valid, committed, and final, although that is still problematic with systems that don't have absolute finality.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 14:26:05 GMT):<br/>
Any other number, i.e., just using submitted or committed transactions can be gamed, and also don't help understand the real throughput or latency
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 14:58:40 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the free action items @mwagner :P
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 15:07:49 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal I agree that only committed transactions should count for throughput. For finality I think we are circling around the bitcoin-ng paper's definitions of epsilon and delta. see section 6.
https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi16/nsdi16-paper-eyal.pdf
The simple version is, at what point do all the validators respond with the same state. 
You'd want to use tolerances in a public network, but we have an easier problem in measuring permissioned networks because the population and topology are known. 
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 15:52:00 GMT):<br/>
Uhm - why don't we just say that the "transaction finality threshold/predicate/function/..." used is part of the SUT description (maybe with explicit constraints in benchmark definitions and methodological suggestions in our document) and leave it at that? I love fiddling with the measurability of consensus properties as much as the next man (well... maybe even more),  but for me, all this stuff seems to be more technical than necessary. For general-purpose performance comparison of "distributed ledger services" (emphasis on service), I would just say "delay for Txs that are considered final", "goodput for Txs that are considered final", etc. What "being final" means is situational, so maybe belongs into SUT definition. The important thing is that its there, so if a vendor tries to pull some *expletive*, it can be called upon its *expletive*.
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 15:52:35 GMT):<br/>
But this is certainly just my opinion.
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 15:53:12 GMT):<br/>
its -> it's
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 16:19:27 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal - my view is that the throughput, delay and ratio of "valid, committed and final" transactions are the _primary_ and truly "service" level KPIs, so it's not a problem if we focus on those :) The relationships you are referring to - those seem to be internal affairs of the specific technology. We could even call it "effective throughput", but throughput in itself should be enough of a term if we understand it at the application level. For your Fabric example, in my book that's 1 Tx/s and a delay of <1 sec (with default block time). We can debate error rate; one can make an argument that if the clients are conscious of the nature of Fabric MVCC and do a (time-limited) number of retries: the error rate can be zero, throughput a whopping 1 Tx/s and delay a nice biggish number of seconds. For your PoW example: I would say that the "finality" criterium should be (correctly) specified in the SUT description (6 blocks, 1 hour, etc.); benchmark/measurement definition should say that a measurement where there are rollbacks beyond that are deemed invalid; and for your example, throughput (effective throughput, goodput, ... whatever we call it) would be 0. And average delay NaN. Does that make sense?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/performance-and-scale-wg?msg=FYc3a2bY4PG8RBvxe) @toddinpal Correct. We had discussed this several months back. One proposal was to provide both goodput and throughput numbers along with the reasons for transactions failing (check Appendix B). But its hard to align reasons across BC platforms. Plus its beyond our scope. Thats why we settled for considering only "valid" transactions in throughput.

I think we had discussions focused on (some ground that we had trodden before).
In short we had 
a. probabilistic consensus vs. definite consensus 
b. separate sub chains vs global chain 
c. validation then ordering vs. ordering and validation separated. 

This has resulted in debates in the paper around.
a. Finality debate ( epsilon delta etc) 
b. The definition of "global"and "Blockchain work" 
c. "definitions of consensus"

This begs the question of what should be measured and alluded to in the metrics document. I agree with Imre. All others are measuring edge conditions, pathologies, recoverability- resiliency etc. Appropriate for stress tests for particular topologies (huge network diameter etc.)

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:25:57 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal this is related to the probability of each transaction where the attacker will catch up; if you are buying a coffee then merchant can take just one confirmation (maybe a high probability); but if you are selling a Renoir the you might wait for 600 blocks where the probability of being attacked reduces considerably. But the 6 blocks figure will give you something like 0.1% probability. Which is acceptable to most normal transactions which are not of high value.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:27:05 GMT):<br/>
This analysis was done when BTC was meant to be used for transactions #whatwillsatoshithink

<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:28:27 GMT):<br/>
y is probability to catch up, x is the block depth the attacker begins with
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:28:56 GMT):<br/>
colors encode the hash rate portion the attacker controls
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:29:52 GMT):<br/>
Satoshi's analysis was z=5 when q=0.1
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:30:06 GMT):<br/>
meaning that even if you control much less than "51%", there may be a real probability for a successful attack
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:30:36 GMT):<br/>
Satoshi gave the formula and computed for z=5 and q=0.1
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:30:42 GMT):<br/>
and probability of success < 0.1 %
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:31:00 GMT):<br/>
ikocsis graphed the formula for this year's Bitcoin lecture :)
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:31:19 GMT):<br/>
My take is that the figure of waiting for 6 confirmations can be traced back to the original paper
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:31:21 GMT):<br/>
(sorry for the off topic, I couldn't resist)
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:31:25 GMT):<br/>
sure
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:31:26 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:31:40 GMT):<br/>
Which is what I said in the call
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:33:47 GMT):<br/>
We have that 6 sprinkled around in our paper which may not be appropriate
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:35:12 GMT):<br/>
Actually this 6 confirmation business is never properly explained anywhere- it is often thrown around as a random number
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:35:12 GMT):<br/>
Actually this 6 confirmation business is not properly explained when people cite the number- it is often thrown around as a random number- however it relates to the original paper
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:36:08 GMT):<br/>
In fact in the paper we have 
P < 0.001
q=0.10 z=5
q=0.15 z=8
q=0.20 z=11
q=0.25 z=15
q=0.30 z=24
q=0.35 z=41
q=0.40 z=89
q=0.45 z=340
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:39:10 GMT):<br/>
So if your x axis is extended to 340, we should see the q=.45 almost touch the x axis to be close to .1 %; since your x-axis stops at 12.5 we do not see this
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:39:30 GMT):<br/>
Of course at 51% we don't stand a chance
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:40:14 GMT):<br/>
The point of all this is to re-examine the 6 confirmation refernces we have in our metrics paper
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:40:47 GMT):<br/>
But it isn't random at all - see exactly what you cite :)
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:41:08 GMT):<br/>
But it is certainly very misleading - what about Ethereum? 6 sure as heck won't be enough
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:41:19 GMT):<br/>
I agree, I don't say it is random
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:42:22 GMT):<br/>
And that is PoW, too (yet)
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:42:23 GMT):<br/>
I am saying people throw that number 6 around as a random choice without seeing that it is based on the paper and the table that Satoshi created
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:42:32 GMT):<br/>
oh, I see
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:42:36 GMT):<br/>
that's true
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:42:36 GMT):<br/>
that's very true
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:46:45 GMT):<br/>
In this light we should look at the references to the number 6 in OUR metrics paper
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:49:44 GMT):<br/>
It is good to see your graph @ikocsis 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:50:26 GMT):<br/>
Did you use Satoshi's C code
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:50:35 GMT):<br/>
heh
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:50:35 GMT):<br/>
to generate the graph
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:51:53 GMT):<br/>
no, as much of what I did in the last few years is rather data sciency stuff (I wouldn't call it actual science) - just gave it in closed form to R
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:53:29 GMT):<br/>
I didn't really understand why it was given in C code in the Satoshi paper (I mean there's R, Matlab, Octave, ... for such stuff) - but this must be a cultural thing. Security people tend to think in C and bash...
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:55:01 GMT):<br/>
It is also an age thing
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:55:21 GMT):<br/>
We were coding in c back then
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:56:32 GMT):<br/>
Even when we thought we were coding in C++
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 21:57:46 GMT):<br/>
well, there must be something to that, too - my education mostly covered the ASM - C - C++ - Java route and I heavy R specialization came later... meaning that I'm somewhat ok with Python, Go is a bit strange, but nice at places - but I do vehemently dislike JavaScript
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 22:00:01 GMT):<br/>
Anyhow
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 22:00:22 GMT):<br/>
So back to the paper- let me look at refernces to 6 confirmations
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 22:00:31 GMT):<br/>
Ok, sure
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 22:00:47 GMT):<br/>
in the metrics paper
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 22:01:36 GMT):<br/>
And if you have time - I don't have any solid reference on this for Ethereum (stackoverflow isn't exactly that), but an authoritative and argued number would be nice there, too
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 22:02:44 GMT):<br/>
This is actually exactly why I try to say that we should make metric definitions on a "when the Tx can be deemed final" basis, leaving the definition of finality to the SUT definition phase
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 22:02:56 GMT):<br/>
I agree
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 22:03:43 GMT):<br/>
Otherwise we can't meaningfully compare say, Ethereum and Fabric - what is I'm convinced to be actually doable 
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 22:04:57 GMT):<br/>
I will think more about this and see how I can contribute
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 22:13:17 GMT):<br/>
@mwagner - for what it's worth, I will be next week at the ISO TC 307 meeting (Blockchain standardisation) in London; I will try to make known the work we are doing here. (Although Consensus would be nicer...)
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 22:19:02 GMT):<br/>
Also - I don't know whether people looked at my two blurbs related to faultload (zero comments on that part); I'm fully ok with simply deleting those, if the consensus is that they are too tangential or otherwise problematic
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 01:44:07 GMT):<br/>
@ikocsis Not sure I fully understand what a faultload is...  My concern, which I'm not sure is related, is that publishing a number about transaction throughput or latency without an understanding of what a transaction is, makes the number meaningless.  If we define a transaction as something that is valid, committed, and final, then we have a more concrete number.  If we don't consider those attributes, someone can publish performance numbers that are totally meaningless.  My Fabric example above actually pointed out a potential performance problem with Fabric due to poor design, but if we allow someone to benchmark Fabric with only one endorsing peer and a solo orderer and hundreds or thousands of channels, they can probably hit 10,000 or more TPS.  But that configuration has nearly zero trust and relatively low availability.  Well readers understand that?

<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 01:45:42 GMT):<br/>
With the faultload stuff I was actually referring to self-contained, not reviewed parts of the metrics document - so I think that's unrelated
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 01:46:08 GMT):<br/>
Another trivial example is if someone tries to submit transactions with an invalid signature, does anyone even care about those?  They'll get invalidated at some point, and they clearly don't provide any useful work (not to be confused with Dan's work)
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 01:46:35 GMT):<br/>
ok, I'm not following.. sorry
</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 01:46:46 GMT):<br/>
I fully agree that we should absolutely focus on "valid, committed and final" transactions
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Wed, 09 May 2018 01:47:10 GMT):<br/>
yeah

@toddinpal @VipinB @ikocsis : Just caught up with the above discussion. Regarding finality, we have had discussions in the past that are reflected in the current version of Appendix A. Although it is written in context of latency, it very well applies to throughput as well. It will be worth revisiting the text, and see what cases we haven't covered, or polish the text, or fix the references, etc.

@toddinpal : In consensus with our WG, we can stick to Tx as "(committed) transactions per sec." as the ONLY metric a Caliper-like tool is suppose to provide. Just that in case of networks with prob. finality, a Caliper-like tool will present the measurements in a `historic' sense, like tps in (now-3) to (now-1) hour, since the transactions in the past 1 hr might be in a block that gets stale eventually. For immediate consensus, the throughput metrics are more 'live' and can be viewed as the perf. test is coming along. 

@VipinB  @ikocsis : Assuming a geometric distribution for tx to get included in a block, I have a plot in case 3 of Appendix B, using the following R code. This is just for representation, to get the concept clear for the readers. I haven't had a chance to review your analysis from Satoshi's paper.

In case of networks with prob. finality, while a performance test is on-going, a Caliper-like tool will present the measurements in a 'historic' sense, like tps in `(now-3)` to `(now-1)` hour, since some of the transactions in the past 1 hr might be in a block that gets stale eventually. For immediate consensus, the throughput metrics are more 'live' and can be viewed as the perf. test is coming along. 

@VipinB  @ikocsis : Assuming a geometric distribution for tx to get included in a block, I have a plot in case 3 of Appendix B, using the following R code. This is just for representation, to get the concept clear for the readers. I haven't had a chance to review your analysis from Satoshi's paper.
```#Discrete case: 
x = 1 + rgeom(1000, 0.7);
sorted_x = sort(x);
n = length(x); 
ecdf_y = (1:(n))/(n);
plot(sorted_x, ecdf_y, type='s', xlab="Block Number", ylab="Cum. prob (transaction confirmed)")

#Continuous case: 
x_exp <- rexp(1000, 0.1)
plotty <- ecdf(x_exp)
x_exp_cdf <- plotty(unique(x_exp))
plot(x_exp, x_exp_cdf, type='p', xlab="Time (sec.)", ylab="Cum. prob (transaction confirmed)")```

@toddinpal  @VipinB  @ikocsis: Just caught up with the above discussion. Regarding finality, we have had discussions in the past that are reflected in the current version of Appendix A. Although it is written in context of latency, it very well applies to throughput as well. It will be worth revisiting the text, and see what cases we haven't covered, or polish the text, or fix the references, etc.

For immediate consensus, the throughput metrics are more 'live' and can be viewed as the perf. test is coming along.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/performance-and-scale-wg?msg=sJhMPRk42Rzgrnao3) @ikocsis The text nicely summarizes what you described in the meeting earlier. However, I feel it doesn't fit well with this document, where we are focused on metrics and how to measure it. We should keep this text for a future document, where we can have a section on (sensible) load generation.

<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 18:42:37 GMT):<br/>
@krabradosty what percentage of transactions are you submitting which modify the same location?
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 18:44:18 GMT):<br/>
I believe there is an effect where those transactions need to be re-submitted/simulated due to the fabric MVCC design
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Mon, 21 May 2018 18:44:40 GMT):<br/>
if some percentage of your transactions fall into this category, that may be why you aren't getting the results you expect

From: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50334489/performance-test-of-the-hyperledger-fabric


Fabric performance:
Fabric is a queueing system. With a high load, the waiting time increases exponentially (queueing property) and hence the transaction latency. However, for golevelDB, we should get at least 2000 tps with a low latency. 
From the CPU utilization plot, it looks like only 16 vCPUs are utilized fully out of 36 vCPUs. What value is set for validatorPoolSize in core.yaml for each peer? You can set this value equal or lesser than the block size and check whether the throughput increases. 
The performance would differ based on the 
1.	workload (fabcar vs fabcoin), 
2.	disk (hdd vs ssd, local vs network attached), 
3.	load generator (CLI vs SDK), 
4.	load generation method (open system vs closed system (https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/nsdi06/tech/full_papers/schroeder/schroeder.pdf) vs some distribution) and 
5.	network bandwidth (at least 1.6 Gbps for 2700 tps). 
Also, ensure that the load generator is not becoming a bottleneck. It would be better the latency can be divided further into (endorsement latency, ordering latency, commit latency) and collect other resource utilization such as network and disk so that the bottleneck can be identified easily.
You can refer to our technical paper titled Performance Benchmarking and Optimizing Hyperledger Fabric (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OsIoPtlv5X2PWyOAlDn1FCnHCZPyrF57/view) . We have conducted a comprehensive empirical study. With levelDB, we should get at least 2000 tps with a low latency.

Guy, Mark Simpson, and i talked about finality for about 25 minutes. My main takeaway was there are multiple definitions of finality based on the use case. In the simple bank case, a small check may clear immediately, but a large check may have a 3 day hold placed on the funds. So different levels of finality. Now how to capture that in a document and as a measurement

Hi everyone!
</p>
<p><strong>dappcoder</strong> (Tue, 05 Jun 2018 13:06:04 GMT):<br/>
My name is Alex Males. I am part of Hashgraph development community. We are interested in building a PoC to plug-in Hashgraph consensus (aBFT) into Fabric's Orderer.
</p>
<p><strong>dappcoder</strong> (Tue, 05 Jun 2018 13:08:16 GMT):<br/>
Hashgraph is a high throughput (200k+ TPS) consensus algorithm that has been proved viable for permissioned ledger use cases. They are also in plan to launch a public ledger this year. 
</p>
<p><strong>dappcoder</strong> (Tue, 05 Jun 2018 13:11:24 GMT):<br/>
Can you help me figure out if an integration Fabric Orderer + Hashgraph would be helpful? As I see it, hashgraph needs a good dev toolset/framework (like Composer or chaincode) while Fabric might benefit from BFT provided by Hashgraph. I saw that there is a BFT consensus implementation in the works in hyperledger JIRA.
</p>
<p><strong>dappcoder</strong> (Tue, 05 Jun 2018 13:16:38 GMT):<br/>

As @mwagner is away, I have volunteered to facilitate the meeting
We will use the Zoom number -  https://zoom.us/j/4034983298


Topics we should cover:


1) Antitrust notice -- Please make sure you are in compliance with the notice before the meeting .  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_ObsXjgeZdNSFBrejY3MUpRMTFWQ2tDcjBmRzdDNzhoRVFZ/view 

2) Assuming we will meet next week. Will many people be around on 03-July ?

3) Amsterdam Hackfest. Is anyone from this WG going ? 
Should we try to do anything as a WG ?

4) Move forward on the metrics document.  

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DQ6PqoeIH0pCNJSEYiw7JVbExDvWh_ZRVhWkuioG4k0


Please review before the meeting. Any open comments will be discussed and hopefully resolved. Feel encouraged to use the mailing list for discussions as well. Lets wrap this important milestone up!


5)  Other topics ?

</p>
<p><strong>harsha0826</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 05:34:51 GMT):<br/>
what are the key performance indicators should be checked in Block Chain application?
</p>
<p><strong>bartman250</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 09:47:27 GMT):<br/>
@harsha0826 -we're working through these - but the main one is 'finality' i.e. the point at which the data has reach consensus and is very hard to change
</p>
<p><strong>bartman250</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 09:48:25 GMT):<br/>
this is similar to ordinary databases, in terms of the time it takes to commit a transaction
</p>
<p><strong>bartman250</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 09:48:50 GMT):<br/>
the second is throughput - > i.e. how many transactions per second can the whole blockchain network process
</p>
<p><strong>harsha0826</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 09:56:39 GMT):<br/>
so only two KPI's we are looking in Block chain at present? @bartman250 
</p>

Could I ask that when you start and end your calls, you say that in the zoom chat room? Just say something like "started performance and scale call" and "ended call"? It would make my life easier tying recordings to meetings
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Mon, 09 Jul 2018 22:44:51 GMT):<br/>
@rjones sure will try to do that

<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Tue, 10 Jul 2018 14:13:15 GMT):<br/>
@Dan, the Tuxedo reference was with regard to distributed transaction management.  Tuxedo developed the original XA protocol, which is a two phase commit protocol with presumed abort.  XA is used by most middleware offerings to coordinate the updates to multiple resource managers (databases, queuing systems, etc.)  
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Tue, 10 Jul 2018 14:18:23 GMT):<br/>
In first phase of the commit, the transaction coordinator contacts each resource manager and asks them to prepare to commit, meaning that if they acknowledge they are prepared, they must be able to commit when the transaction coordinator tells them to, which usually means holding on to locks, etc.  If any resource manager indicates it can't be prepared, the transaction coordinator tells all the resource managers to rollback their transaction branches.  If they all indicate they can commit, then the transaction coordinator creates a persistent commit log entry and effectively at that point the transaction is committed, i.e., cannot be undone.  The transaction coordinator then tells each of the resource managers to proceed with committing their branches.  The presumed abort bit means that if there is an error, in general things get rolled back.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Tue, 10 Jul 2018 14:19:58 GMT):<br/>
There is a possibility for lack of agreement or integrity if a resource manager indicates it can commit, and then due to some catastrophic failure cannot commit, the transaction may end up being only partially committed, i.e., a heuristic outcome that must be resolved by some manual steps
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Tue, 10 Jul 2018 14:20:31 GMT):<br/>
So in XA, finality is when the commit log entry is made by the transaction coordinator.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Tue, 10 Jul 2018 15:08:42 GMT):<br/>
@Dan was that what you were looking for?
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Tue, 10 Jul 2018 15:11:25 GMT):<br/>
Regarding the discussion this morning, I think it is important to focus on finality instead of commitment, although it would be useful to have a table in an appendix that provides the differences between committed and final for the more common blockchains as a point of illustration.

@toddinpal yes, that's helpful thanks.
Regarding finality, I'll need to revisit the consensus doc by the arch group. I'm hoping we can just find some existing text there then dealing with this rather nasty can of wor[d,m]s.

Interesting discussion on Performance & Scale WG mailing list on papers published on papers
https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11390 and of course  https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10228, I will tke a closer look at them to see whether they offer any lessons for the metrics definition. Obviously neither of them follow the metrics or other definitions that we have been creating.

Hello folks. I just joined today.  We, at Persistent Systems have done some work on performance benchmarking of Fabric and Quorum.
</p>
<p><strong>arati_baliga</strong> (Fri, 27 Jul 2018 10:18:09 GMT):<br/>
Below are the papers. ```1. Performance Characterization of Hyperledger Fabric - presented at the 1st Crypto Valley Conference on Blockchain Technology, 2018, Zug, Switzerland. (https://www.persistent.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/research-paper-performance-characterization-of-hyperledger-fabric.pdf)```2. Performance Evaluation of the Quorum Blockchain Platform (https://www.persistent.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/research-paper-performance-evaluation-of-the-quorum-blockchain-platform.pdf)```Could these be posted to the PSWG library since they are relevant contributions ?

Hey everyone, I have generated ~20 million transactions (I have set number of transactions per block to 50). And it seems more the blocks/data or larger the ledger/chain, the network performance is worser (in terms of TPS). Particularly, peers' disk utilization is getting higher and higher. Is it normal?

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 14:39:04 GMT):<br/>
Cool thanks. We just concluded that there's not a meaningful second definition of latency. However the process to get there involved diagraming and so we are going to try to make those diagrams presentable and put them in the appendix examples.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 14:55:17 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal fyi, a general diagram for random leader election is yucky. So I'm going to model one specifically on the example in the appendix that it's going to be attached to.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 15:00:18 GMT):<br/>
So what are the general ideas you are stuck on? Please put it succinctly(less than 30 words) @Dan @toddinpal , sometimes just restating can let us see where there are common points. 
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 15:06:33 GMT):<br/>
Not stuck. Just realized when we look at the castro diagram and talk about the other protocols that the definition we have seems to cover all of them. The exercise of looking at the diagram was instructive so we are going to try to capture that in the doc so it's clear to others too.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 15:07:01 GMT):<br/>
Now the trick will be making simple diagrams that relate to the examples.

must say I don't what a castro diagram is...:/   google and wikipedia don't help
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:52:14 GMT):<br/>
but I would say it doesn't need to be perfect, just capture the basics / general view and we can have the designers finish it up
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 20:05:23 GMT):<br/>
Yeah I tucked one of the diagrams in then got sucked into a meeting... (the diagram I was referencing is the PBFT diagram in the paper by Castro et al. ) Incidentally I don't know what the rules are for copying that graphic into our paper. I guess we can just cite the image?
See fig 1: http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 20:49:28 GMT):<br/>
Ok, I'm happy with the additions to the examples. I pasted in a the graphic from the pbft paper with a link for citation. If someone who is practiced at writing citations can fill that in properly at the end of the doc that would be cool.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 20:49:59 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal will probably be adding one more example - time permitting.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 21:21:24 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, I'm trying to create an equivalent diagram for Fabric
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 21:22:45 GMT):<br/>
Note I updated the labels at the top of my diagram to better align with the castro labels

@toddinpal Is BFT or PBFT in prod on Fabric? I only see solo and Kafka in 1.2
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 15:25:08 GMT):<br/>
No, Kafka and Solo are the only ordering services in Fabric 1.2
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 17:15:19 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal @Dan is the document ready for group review yet ?  If so can someone send an email or let me know and I will.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 18:07:36 GMT):<br/>
I think my work was done. @toddinpal if you want to accept the proposed text for latency that I put in last weekend we can 'finalize' that part. If you want me to check in on your fabric example / diagram let me know. I don't have the doc up now to see if it's in.

@Dan: Thanks. Please review my changes on Appendix Case 3. And I will accept yours from Case 1, 2. For Case 2, perhaps we can go for a smaller example with 5-7 nodes, just to save space. We all know Sawtooth and PoET can scale well :sunglasses:

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 14 Sep 2018 14:01:47 GMT):<br/>
yeah i thought about using a smaller case, but it seemed like that might misconstrue part of the difference. I imagine the layout person can split the table in formatting so it's in columns and takes up less space.

<p><strong>NoLimitHoldem</strong> (Fri, 28 Sep 2018 09:43:29 GMT):<br/>
Is there a max storage limit of Hyperledger Fabric? Such as, in the case of 6xTB or some other numbers... If so, in case that number is reached, what should we do?
</p>
<p><strong>NoLimitHoldem</strong> (Fri, 28 Sep 2018 09:43:45 GMT):<br/>
Also, I found that when the ledger size for 1 channel grows, the TPS is getting worse. In my 600 users simulation case, the rough correlation of TPS and # of transactions made (each is roughly 2.8x-3.x KB, the transaction just does a simple PutState) is -0.6. Anyone try more about that?
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Sun, 30 Sep 2018 13:43:10 GMT):<br/>
@NoLimitHoldem You should ask on the fabric channels, they should have better information

<p><strong>rajanashutosh</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 04:22:13 GMT):<br/>
hi all, Need help on performing the load and performance tests. I have a fabric network with following architecture.
Fabric network contains 3 Zookeepers containers, 4 Kafka brokers, 3 Orderers, 4 Organizations ( Each org has 1 dedicated CA, 2 Peers and dedicated CouchDb). They are deployed on to three VMs. \
</p>
<p><strong>rajanashutosh</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 04:23:04 GMT):<br/>
Being a multi-host environment we use docker swarm for clustering between VMs.
</p>
<p><strong>rajanashutosh</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 04:23:46 GMT):<br/>
Java SDK interacts with our Fabric network on top of which I have Spring to expose REST apis.
</p>
<p><strong>rajanashutosh</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 04:25:12 GMT):<br/>
While testing our throughput was stuck on 40 tps (Write), which after modifications on docker containers and swarm network (already and open issue) got increased to 200 tps. 
</p>
<p><strong>rajanashutosh</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 04:25:37 GMT):<br/>
Kindly request you to please suggest where I might be wrong.

Me and my team are considering conducting a research on performance optimization on a Hyperledger platform. If you have any ideas relating to that please let me know
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 14:12:40 GMT):<br/>
@tahaf10 integral to any performance optimization would be the concept of measurement, for this we have a series of metrics defined in the PSWG paper, as well as a tool to conduct measurement as in #caliper . Which specific dlt are you interested in tuning? HL fabric, HL Sawtooth, others? There are efforts and papers in each of these platforms towards that end.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/performance-and-scale-wg?msg=r6zsquDPHCbXQx7qR) @VipinB I'm still considering which Platform to go with. Which is why I wanted to get your valuable opinion on this. Most of my work has been on Hyperledger Fabric, and I'm particularly interested in the new concept of deploying Solidity based Smart Contracts on Fabric but I'm definitely open to learning new things. I was also looking at https://www.hyperledger.org/resources/research-topics & the optimization topic interests me the most

*From Shadow FAQ:  My interpolations are in bold*
Shadow is a network simulator/emulator hybrid. It runs real applications, but it simulates network and system functions thereby emulating the kernel to the application. The suitability of Shadow to your problem depends upon what exactly you are trying to measure. 
*What it can do*: If you are interested in analyzing changes in application behavior, e.g. application layer queuing, failure modes, or design changes, and how those changes affect the operation of the system and network performance, then Shadow seems like a very good choice (especially if you want to minimize work on your end). 
*What it is not intended to do*: If your research relies on, e.g., the accuracy of specific kernel features or kernel parameter settings, or dynamic changes in Internet routing, then Shadow may not be the right choice as it does not precisely model these behaviors. Shadow is also not the best at measuring cryptographic overhead, so if that is desired then it should probably be done more directly as a separate research component.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 17:00:08 GMT):<br/>
Since consensus algorithms rely on some of the functions in the section outside of what shadow supports, I get the feeling that research into complex interactions along those lines may be difficult to do. I must confess that I have not looked at Shadow in depth, so I may be completely off base here.

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 23:54:13 GMT):<br/>
It looks like the GFT paper quotes our paper but then ignores the critical part of that, that performance should be reported in the context of the network size.
It later reads to me that the test network had a single point of failure. "There is one dedicated clearinghouse node for each exchange."

They are doing this in the context of DTCC, and DAH is also working with ASX; both of these are very established and powerful entities. So I agree with you @Dan, they are not going to the pure solution. However it is possible that the matching and clearing functions can be automated and the matching and clearing will become less central as adoption takes hold. This was my argument to them when DAH/DTCC were sketching out Repo Trading, DTCC wanted to host nodes and I was arguing that the second phase should consider a more decentralized structure. Incremental change, rather than wholesale change. 
There are two other interesting points 1. The definition of transaction from the business point of view rather than the blockchain point of view 2.They give some sense of scale: 
"Since each DA Platform Node and DAML Application is comprised of multiple software components, many are deployed in separate Kubernetes pods. In this particular example, each exchange is deployed to the same pod as a trade injector, because they scale together, but each exchange-trade injector pair is in its own pod; in this simulation, *there are 25 such pairs*." 
You are right that they try to reproduce existing processes rather than seeing how the Business Process could be redesigned. As is evident from their description:

 Trade injectors, which simulate the input of brokers by sending trades to the exchange.
 Exchanges, which write these matched trades to the ledger.
 The clearinghouse, which coordinates all the clearing and settlement activity.
 Clearinghouse subordinate nodes, which confirm and novate the trades and perform a subset of the
netting process. There is one dedicated clearinghouse node for each exchange.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/performance-and-scale-wg?msg=XjgbWDtTfeWCS2Zgu) @sergey.khoroshavin From a quick read of this python code this seems to be the breakdown Key=utc+seqno; Value itself is a keyvalue pair (Metricname, value)
Where Metricname is one of the enums in the class MetricNames (two groups, one base metric and one offset by 30000); Value is either a number or bignum (depending on the metric name) 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 20 Nov 2018 15:21:52 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for that
</p>
<p><strong>sergey.khoroshavin</strong> (Tue, 20 Nov 2018 15:24:19 GMT):<br/>
Yes, and seqno in key is used just to avoid situation when different metrics hits same timestamp and overwrite each other

Since you have functions for encode, decode and encode_key all this is nicely wrapped....
</p>
<p><strong>sergey.khoroshavin</strong> (Tue, 20 Nov 2018 15:33:34 GMT):<br/>
Also wrapping things helps a lot with writing concise unit tests... I'd also like to clarify that bignum in value is actually binary encoded ValueAccumulator, and now all metrics are stored as these ValueAccumulators, not numbers. The reason why numbers are here are historical - first versions of metrics were writing all events to database, then we found it to be a bit expensive and switched to buffering and accumulating strategy. But we had some databases from older load test runs, hence support for two versions. In future plain numbers will be dropped.

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 20 Nov 2018 15:34:35 GMT):<br/>
@sergey.khoroshavin I am wondering if many of these metrics can be derived from more primitive metrics - I have not looked at them in detail
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 20 Nov 2018 15:39:26 GMT):<br/>
Or have them be hooked up by level...i.e. a monitoring level log level or error_level? Might become more relevant as Sovrin (for example) gets productionized and the data accumulates. Also any refernce to your chaos engineering efforts will be useful 
</p>
<p><strong>sergey.khoroshavin</strong> (Tue, 20 Nov 2018 15:47:40 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB we tried not to be redundant when adding metrics, but there are overlaps, especially between "normal" ones and "function profiling"
</p>
<p><strong>sergey.khoroshavin</strong> (Tue, 20 Nov 2018 15:48:43 GMT):<br/>
Adding monitoring levels is also interesting idea, thanks. Probably not critical issue now, but it could be useful in future
</p>
<p><strong>sergey.khoroshavin</strong> (Tue, 20 Nov 2018 15:56:00 GMT):<br/>
And as for chaos engineering - we have separate repository with system-level and chaos tests: https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-test-automation
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 20 Nov 2018 20:08:01 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for that... @sergey.khoroshavin I am taking a look at the actual tests that do the chaos
</p>

asset TransferPointsTxn identified by transactionId {
  o String transactionId
  --> Account account
}
Basically we have a participant called account, and the transactions the account makes is recorded in this asset with transactionId pointing to the ledger transaction. What we are seeing is, when we try to look at an Account's transactions, cycling through the TransferPointTxn asset is pretty fast (it is from couchdb, and the query is indexed with a view etc) but when we try to pull the corresponding transaction from the ledger with a nested query based on transactionid, the retrieval from the ledger slows drown dramatically. With less than 100,000 transactions in the ledger, we are now seeing that it takes almost 2 seconds to retrieve each transaction from the ledger. 
The query on TransaferPointsTxn asset itself takes only a few seconds totally for a typical account, but the subquery to retrieve each transaction from the ledger is taking almost 2 seconds per transaction! This means if a customer has 20 transactions, we spend 2 + 20*2 = 42 seconds for the retrieval.

So question really is, as we add more transactions to the ledger, are there ways for improving query performance of the ledger ?. WIth assets and participants being in Couchdb, the performance there can be optimized various ways, but what tools do we have to optimize ledger query performance ?

Expanding on the Shared code and domain models in the diagram above:
Fundamental Data Type Primitives  
Designed for blockchain (e.g. deterministically serializable and computable)
Booleans
Enums
Structs
Fixed precision numerics (in lieu of floating points)
See extensible data types RFC linked earlier.

Data Models 
Domain Nouns
Organization
Product
Location
Compliant with industry spec 
(e.g. GS1) 

</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 15:22:32 GMT):<br/>
The output of HL Grid(the supplychain project) is meant to be (according to my understanding)
1. A Reference implementation- generalized through WASM
2. Reference Implementation contains a library of shared code and domain models complaint with GS1 which can be reused in other use case implementations (not just supply chain)
3. A launchpad to port this to other DLTs (Fabric, Burrow, Iroha, Quilt?) and using Indy: Helped by WASM integration as well as shared code for GS1 (industry spec)

<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 15:42:04 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 15:54:09 GMT):<br/>
Ok, do I understand it right - the key thing is actually not the "shared code" (as in procedural stuff), but having an actual standardized data/domain/asset/... (however you want to call it) model prefabbed and ready for anybody to use? If yes, then this is really good and this should be definitely a "framework project", above Sawtooth/Fabric but below actual applications in the stack
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 16:15:04 GMT):<br/>
Yeah it's probably both. The code will be behind the wasm boundary so any project that wants to adopt the wasm interpreter should get all the code ported for free. There's another interesting bit that the code is going to be in rust (which compiles into wasm) so also if a platform doesn't want to use web assembly they could fork the rust and shim in their own native framework interface. And then to your point, yes this project will be pathfinding a lot of the schema questions - so just sorting that out will I think really move the needle on making it easier to develop useful more interoperable applications.

<p><strong>ikocsis</strong> (Tue, 04 Dec 2018 16:23:51 GMT):<br/>

Hi Everyone, I finished my Ph.D. thesis last month. Thank y'all for all the interaction over the last year, it helped me speed up my research. I thought of sharing our work on performance modeling of Fabric V1. Using stochastic modeling techniques, we developed a performance model of Fabric V1 network, from which we estimate various performance measures (throughput, latency, mean queue length) as a function of system and application configuration. We validated our models using a Fabric network setup in our lab. The relevant paper is attached here.

Looks like we have the following from the meeting:
-STAC commercial model vs. our participation model
-STAC is focused on financial sector, trading, trade-processing etc. 
-STAC Packs which are the standard instruments (i.e. software) for creating STAC benchmarks arise out of standard metric definitions and software purpose built to measure for a vendor, usually built by community(gated); run by vendors, can be certified by STAC if they control & audit the running of STAC PACK.
-Having community based working groups (Capital Markets, Payments) inside Hyperledger will help drive some of the benchmark metrics in collaboration with STAC.
-We do not have policy guidelines in HL PSWG document (i.e. guidance around auditing, testnet etc.)
-No standards in Blockchain space nor standard apis for interaction that all DLTs follow. _There may be ISDA standards for specific products (Swaps &  Derivatives) that we may be able to utilize_ (my comment)
-We can collaborate - speaking at STAC summit, STAC will ask members about the business for Blockchain based benchmarks, future meetings over email or otherwise etc.
Anything else?

Meeting minutes:
We discussed strategy for the next steps
Should we address Supply Chain (provenance) or Finance use cases to get to the next level of metrics
Supply chain experts and others had contacted Mark
In light of STAC call we should look at finance
Benchmark Model in  TPC is to have separate benchmarks for:  a. OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)  b. Data Integration (ETL- OLTP data combined with other data) c. Decision Support (Queries) - they also have another breakout based on big data, virtualized environment and so on. Do we need such a division? What would such a division look in the Blockchain world? 
STAC also has some some such division between their benchmarks. (STAC-T for tick to trade) processing and execution vs  querying) there are many benchmarks.
Mark Simpson will write down steps for provenance so that we can look at benchmarks falling out from this use case
Vipin will try to map the TPC/STAC ontology to blockchains.
These minutes will be captured in PSWG folder after getting feedback

Hi All! I have a question about finality and the latency@threshold metric (in the context of Fabric and its support in Caliper). 

Problem: even if a transaction successfully goes through the consensus flow, there is the possibility of a transient error happening during actually committing the transaction or its entire encapsulating block (e.g., some DB access error). I think (but not exactly sure) that these kind of situations are signaled by a special error in Fabric, in which case the peer halts the processing of further transactions/blocks, and initiates some recovery protocol. 

Scenario: (at least) one peer confirms the success of a transaction, but other peers run into some transient error, notifying the client (Caliper in this case) about an unsuccessful transaction. But Fabric will _eventually_ synchronize the successful transactions across the network. 

Question 1) Should the transaction be considered as successful? (I think yes. It's committed on at least one peer and will be syncronized to faulty peers eventually.)

Question 2) How do we calculate the latency@threshold metric in this case? Say we have the timestamps for 9 successful events and 1 unsuccessful one. Calculating latency@90% is no problem in this case. But if the percentage of nodes that successfully committed the transaction is below the threshold, then we don't have enough timing data to calculate the metric.

Any insight is greatly appreciated! :)
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 01:26:24 GMT):<br/>
@klenik we debated this question for many days in the finality debate; decided to go with the following separation probabilistic finality vs non-probabilistic; in the first case there can be a re-org and hence the transaction could be non-durable because of a fork. The case of Fabric is the second where the latency@threshold metric may not make sense; in any case the slower diffusion due to faults (which is what you bring up) may point to bigger problems and may not be fixed until the underlying faults are fixed.   
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 01:27:38 GMT):<br/>
So to measure a network that is limping along (90% fault rate) due to some other problem may not be worthwhile
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 01:30:03 GMT):<br/>
Obviously if this fault keeps re-occurring there may be some configuration or other issues. Lower rates for the similar networks with similar rules and payloads than reported rates must be looked into before continuing the measurement

</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 04 Feb 2019 16:13:52 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB Thank you for the answer! So the semantics should be something like the following for Fabric (from a measuring/reporting point-of-view): even one successful confirmation means that the transactions is committed; and the latency@threshold kind of reflects the propagation/processing delay in the network, so it can be interpreted as a percentile calculation for the latency of transaction confirmations.  Am I heading in the right direction?

Does anyone know why the Waterloo group didn't abandon the requirement that the ordering service is the source of complete blocks?  Couldn't it just create blocks of transactions IDs and let the peers via gossip disseminate the transactions and create the blocks based upon the transaction ID's ordered by the ordering service?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 03:21:33 GMT):<br/>
It might be due to this "Notably, our approach does not require any modification of
the existing ordering interface, allowing us to leverage existing
Fabric clients and peer code." Taken directly from the paper. Of course you can

@YanLIU0822 The ordering service constructs a block when __any__ of the following event happens:
1. `MaxMessageCount` is reached
2. `AbsoluteMaxBytes` is reached
3. `BatchTimeout` is reached
So maybe it wasn't `MaxMessageCount` that triggered the block creation in your case, so changing (increasing/decreasing?) it didn't have any effect.

We had 10 people today
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 20 Mar 2019 21:07:55 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB I didn't set those to repeat, so if you want them to repeat, let me know

No Prob, just an experiment @rjones So I need two days today 8 pm EDT ( +1 00:00 UTC) and on April 3 the same time, If we are running with it then we will repeat

</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Mon, 25 Mar 2019 18:40:38 GMT):<br/>
should link that in the pwsg wiki somewhere.
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Mon, 25 Mar 2019 18:41:05 GMT):<br/>
top item in the "Groups" pull down
</p>
<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Mon, 25 Mar 2019 18:41:08 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Mon, 25 Mar 2019 19:28:12 GMT):<br/>
@mwagner I think DST shifted the meeting. Shows as 6am Pacific, 9am Eastern right now. Alternatively, the calendar links need to be adlusted for daylight, not sure what to use as the TZ column...

Provenance use case received a lot of attention from @KellyCooper  who has edited it for readability. By tomorrow's call I will use gs1 based standards to model a few items. Namely, identities of the various roles, tags, the snapshot data etc. gs1 is a huge standard since it has to cover both generic and specific description of all goods as well as docs .... Will attempt to consolidate.

Are we still shooting for a f2f in the bay area on  Sept 20?

@toddinpal is that for Arch WG or PSWG?

Posted the following to #Grid  
" #performance-and-scale-wg is in the process of creating a provenance use case to be the driver for objective metrics across dlts. The data model uses GS1 concepts. The preliminary writeup is in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pARtxESnOqQViJabErC5hxFupyfZWCWtOnxsLVtHP4Y/edit?usp=sharing - Would like to find out what the level of GS1 support in Grid. I have been poking around the repo, any tips about layout or documentation of the repo will also be appreciated."

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Mon, 16 Sep 2019 21:04:21 GMT):<br/>
Started a conversation with grid folks about this, although they seem to be in the RFC phase (which is type and interface definitions) for the GS1 stuff, they have a product RFC as well as - I will take a look at GLN which seems to be their way of defining enterprises...

@ChristianLF is it similar to Cello? How is it different. I will also read it more carefully
</p>
<p><strong>ChristianLF</strong> (Wed, 18 Sep 2019 19:27:22 GMT):<br/>
Hey @VipinB thanks for the question, I will say no. The reason being is that Cello is more of a management tool for business who build on top of Hyperledger Projects. The proposed project Hyperledger Beam would allow for Businesses to build a blockchain("instance") on top of the Scroda Platform, in which they have complete control privacy control while still being able to utilize all of Scroda's Nodes thus allowing for Projects to have Privacy Control while still obtaining maximum security as a unlimited # of nodes are able to validate transactions all while still being scalable. You can think of it as Quorum but with the ability to obtain more security and scalability.

In light of today's discussion we see the following: https://gist.github.com/awemany/619a5722d129dec25abf5de211d971bd
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 14:28:15 GMT):<br/>
The concept behind ZCF (Zero Confirmation Forfeits)
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 14:28:52 GMT):<br/>
As a safety mechanism. ZC itself in BTC is transactions in mempool.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 14:31:30 GMT):<br/>
Essentially Beam proposes the idea of "Ordered ZC", by creating a blockchain (the Ying Chain) that proposes an order without confirmations, that is an ordered mempool if you will.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 14:34:16 GMT):<br/>
Also relies on Scroda DID for admission and DOS attacks by limiting entry
</p>
<p><strong>ChristianLF</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 14:49:01 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for allowing me to present today, to note the ZCF concept only protects against short-term attacks such as a double-spend attack used to redirect a payment that was sent to a merchant in order to spend the funds already used in the transaction before a blockchain confirmation. An unspent output is spent in two different transactions and a miner must choose between one of them.

This does not protect against long-term attacks such as a 51% attack fork. 

While preventing double spending attack is also protects from 51% attacks by offering a fork-free environment. 

Also this relies on Scroda ID a decentralized identity system in order to identify all nodes participating in consensus, this does not limit entry, DOS attacks are prevented through the identification phase in use of Scroda ID.

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 15:29:49 GMT):<br/>
 @ChristianLF Please direct us to the post where you distinguish between ZC and unconfirmed transactions in your context. 
</p>
<p><strong>ChristianLF</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 17:38:04 GMT):<br/>
Wow it seems that I deleted the blog post differentiating it as I thought it had no use. 

Zero-Confirmation Transactions and Unconfirmed transactions are technically the same, these are transactions that have yet to validated by the network, in which consensus has not been reached on. All current blockchains reach consensus at some point in time since blockchain's are trust-less. In these situations users can be assured that even though the network has not reached consensus on a transactions that it will be included on the blockchain if true. Through this assurance they are able to safely accept a payment after having received it and solely verifying its validity. 

Now Instant Transactions are different than Zero-Confirmation Transactions, Instant Transactions are where consensus on a transaction is reached instantly, this is not recommended as such a system will be guaranteed to have security flaws. As we all know the more users we are communicating with the longer it takes for an agreement to be reached as a whole.

Zero-Confirmation Transactions is the most viable route as consensus does not have to be speed up in order for payments to be accepted and considered safe once received.

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 22:23:55 GMT):<br/>
Also to be clear ZCF is in the context of BTC which already has a consensus mechanism which is POW can result in problems due to lack of finality. I understand that your initial ordering uses one of the BFT variants which provide finality. In this context I can see the use for ZC before they join the second chain. We did not discuss Instant transactions on the call IIRC. I agree with your observations on Instant transactions. All in all, I hope that it was worthwhile for you to present on the call. Especially Imre's comments. @ChristianLF @ikocsis -

Regarding todays call, one thought that crossed my mind would be some sort of a measure of TPS and RPS under byzantine circumstances.  For example, a 4 node system where 1 node is no longer responding to or participating in consensus.  Or a 7 node with 2 out, or a system experienceing regular network splits.  The most repetable one is for a network with nodes that drop out just prior to measurement.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 06 Nov 2019 01:58:10 GMT):<br/>
Minutes of the meeting as far as I remember them:
Mark Wagner introduced the theme of the meeting which was to reboot the PSWG under the new regime of the TSC, do away with WGs and come up with new names (either TIG or TSIG), there would be no work products.
-We harked back to the work products, our initial paper on some common terms and current effort to develop common benchmarks looking at a provenance or supply chain use case
-Nick felt that Caliper would need standard benchmarks
-Vipin said that performance  and scale were problems that have to be overcome to have widespread adoption of blockchains (even public Blockchains suffer from this)
-Dano Ferrin said that we could look at the differences with permissionless blockchains and look at whether we need different metrics
Todd said that he was heading up an ISO conference on DLTs, they did not have the concept of finality and they had lots of concepts that were slightly different from what we had in the paper.
We all agreed: 1. change cadence to once fortnightly 2. Adopt what name the TSC comes up with 3. Take another look at the metrics paper to update it or make it a living document. 4. Continue having presentations.
Vipin said that these presentations could yield greater truths applicable to all blockchains like work on microservices to scale blockchain nodes a la fastfabric, have aggregators or pre-processing to create more throughput (like accelerator) and have greater focus on datastore performance through caching to remove a bottleneck or all of the above to improve BC throughput.
We also agreed to work more closely with caliper.
TPS or RPS in a stressed DLT (Dano Ferrin suggests above)

Hi all, I have 4 peers, each running on a t2.small instance (1 CPU, 2gb ram) in one org, there is also 5 orderers each in there own instance
My issue is that i am seeing high memory usage, up to 70-80% on most of the peers, even though no transactions are being done.
After a certain time, the peer containers will just stop running.
I can easily reboot the peer node if memory is high (or restart the container), but the memory usage will just keep increasing until the container stops working again
Before the container stops, some errors that I see in the peer logs are:
[31m2019-11-05 23:58:38.599 UTC [core.comm] ServerHandshake -> ERRO 48c0[0m TLS handshake failed with error write tcp 172.1.1.1:7051->3.1.1.1:40936: i/o timeout server=PeerServer remoteaddress=3.1.1.1:40936

And errors from the chaincode instance:
2019-11-06T00:06:40.616Z [31mERROR[39m [31m[lib/handler.js][39m Chat stream with peer - on error: "Error: 14 UNAVAILABLE: keepalive watchdog timeout\n    at Object.exports.createStatusError (/usr/local/src/node_modules/grpc/src/common.js:91:15)\n    at ClientDuplexStream._emitStatusIfDone (/usr/local/src/node_modules/grpc/src/client.js:233:26)\n    at ClientDuplexStream._receiveStatus (/usr/local/src/node_modules/grpc/src/client.js:211:8)\n    at Object.onReceiveStatus (/usr/local/src/node_modules/grpc/src/client_interceptors.js:1306:15)\n    at InterceptingListener._callNext (/usr/local/src/node_modules/grpc/src/client_interceptors.js:568:42)\n    at InterceptingListener.onReceiveStatus (/usr/local/src/node_modules/grpc/src/client_interceptors.js:618:8)\n    at /usr/local/src/node_modules/grpc/src/client_interceptors.js:1123:18"


Questions are:
- Where/how could I investigate the memory issues? I tried a few things but nothing I can see why the memory keeps increasing
- Is the specs (1cpu, 2gb ram) too low?
- Does the amount of peers (4 in this case) affects the total memory of each individual peer (probably because of gossip, and other communication, etc) ?

Hi all,
I am looking how to work and contribute to several topics: 
1. Deletion on Blockchain: are there any initiatives here? 
2. Performance analysis among different implementations of HL
3. Network partitioning: Any initiatives, data, etc.? 
How do I look for the available work on the topics?  
Thanks!

Hi team - Looking for some guidance - has any performance and scalability testing on PDC - in the context of HLF with volumes of 10-20 million records to 100-200 million records. PDC is in play due to regulations, compliance and need to know basis information sharing. The use case also needs long term retention of information. About 10% volume can be a target for queries. We are assuming couchdb or other supported persistent/durable versioned object stores. Please let us know. Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Mon, 01 Jun 2020 02:52:07 GMT):<br/>
Any topics for a call this week ?
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Tue, 02 Jun 2020 00:07:50 GMT):<br/>
no meeting this week
</p>
<p><strong>sillysachin</strong> (Fri, 12 Jun 2020 14:04:18 GMT):<br/>
A million records per day can easily add 10-15GB in couchdb and deteriorate the performance by 150-200%
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 12 Jun 2020 17:12:17 GMT):<br/>
Saw that some of the solutions for such huge amounts of data segregated on a separate DFS like IPFS (encrypted of course) or on a separate datalake with proofs etc. in PDC. Blockchain is not distributed db.
</p>
<p><strong>pvrbharg</strong> (Tue, 16 Jun 2020 16:06:27 GMT):<br/>
@sillysachin @VipinB Thank you to each for sharing your wisdom and this requires some thinking - in terms of scaling horizontally or using IPFS at PDC layer, per my read. Best wishes.

Hi Channel - I am working on performance benchmark of a PoS chain with the Caliper Framework. I had attempted this an year ago or so but the priorities changed. I would love to contribute and also hear from others who might have done benchmarks for various chains.

I'm helping organize a virtual Hyperledger meetup on Sep 14 that will be focused on performance.  Xilinx will demo their hardware acceleration work and there is space in the agenda for others to demo other performance related efforts.  Let me know if you'd like some space in the meetup.  This could also be a good opportunity to feature the work of the PSWG and promote that to a wider audience.  We were thinking of having a discussion around performance after the demos, so would someone here want to moderate that?  You could introduce yourself and this group to the attendees when the discussion starts.

Hello guys, please am very new to this block chain hyperleger, and am to use it to implement electronic voting system on it for nations election, but all my reviews the consensus have having trade off between scalability and performance, but with this my project the system should have good scalability and good performance. Help please
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 10 May 2021 21:48:50 GMT):<br/>
@skymatrix -- thanks for sharing about what you're looking at doing with blockchain.  for your question, i'd suggest asking about it on the performance and scale group's mailing list.  this chat channel doesn't have many people in it so you'd get a better response on the list.  that is at: https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/perf-and-scale-wg/
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Mon, 10 May 2021 21:49:09 GMT):<br/>
and the group is having a meeting next week and you'd be welcome to join that as well.  https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/PSWG/PSWG+May+18%2C+2021

Thanks for the presentation.  I didn't quite follow the discussions/comments on the relationship between Tape and Caliper...  can you elaborate on which one to use for which situation as well as any thoughts/plans to merge them?

Hi team, I am using Caliper to test Besu which runs IBFT2.0 and has 4 validator nodes (all with ws-RPC enabled). I can successfully benchmark the Besu network by connecting one validator as the endpoint. But the high RPC request rate will saturate the connected validator node. I am wondering how I can set up the test with load balance so that all Besu validators can receive RPC requests. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you.
