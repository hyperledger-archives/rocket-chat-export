{"msg":"Hi all, it is really good that this work is beginning... As a food for thought that is hopefully interesting to people here, here's an overview of research we did on fabric 0.6 (funded by a 2016 IBM Faculty Award, granted to Prof. Pataricza, my research group leader): https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_R1w6XGVPqXYXAzYjJfTVFuLWs/view?usp=drivesdk We found interesting things - obviously the whole exercise should be repeated for fabric 1.0; but a (negative) result was that the whole activity is somewhat academic without broadly-accepted, Blockchain-specific performance concepts/metrics and representative workloads (aka a proper benchmark definition). And this seems to be pretty much in line with Mark's invitation to the telco, so I'm eager to hear about your view on performance and scalability today.","username":"ikocsis","ts":"2017-05-23T23:08:22.845Z"}
{"msg":"interesting work @ikocsis , and i would like to suggest add the latency as perf indicator, as many real scenarios care about it. e.g., latency before the tx is broadcasted, latency before final commitment, etc..","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-05-24T02:41:05.888Z"}
{"msg":"interesting work @ikocsis , and i would like to suggest add more latency analysis as the perf indicator, as many real scenarios care about it. e.g., latency before the tx is broadcasted, latency before final commitment, etc..","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-05-24T02:41:05.888Z"}
{"msg":"And also, the gRPC part is NOT \"surprisingly\" slow :)","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-05-24T02:42:29.156Z"}
{"msg":"Hmm... could you elaborate? We were (and still are) rather inexperienced in gRPC. That said, my expectation was that RPC should not have such an overhead, especially in scenarios where communication is essentially in-memory. We did play with the idea of properly tracing at least a few gRPC calls, but in the end did not have the time.","username":"ikocsis","ts":"2017-05-24T06:47:35.313Z"}
{"msg":"Sorry, I failed to reply to the first part (I'm at a conference) @baohua , in my view the metrics you mentioned are super-important for performance analysis (and we definitely didn't have/had a full coverage) - but are essentially application-internal. Meaning that the clients (in the Hyperledger fabric sense) don't see them directly and most probably don't care about. What they see directly (for fabric 0.6 and with oversimplification) are a) the qualities of the synchronous operation of submitting a Tx request, b) the qualities of the asynchronous operation of fulfilling that request (or not). So my feeling is that the \"service level performance and scalability metrics\", if you like, should be treated separately from the \"internal metrics\". All the more so that the first group is what is potentially comparable across tools, configurations and tool versions.","username":"ikocsis","ts":"2017-05-24T09:35:43.816Z"}
{"msg":"@ikocsis Thanks for ur reply, ikocis, yes, I understand your initial goals. I agree that we may separate those metrics into different folds, like from the end users's perspective, from the developers perspective. I guess you may know the flaming graph in the system perf area. While in the distributed system, what we may more care about is the network performance, rather than the node processing. Hence I would suggest we can also try to classify the metrics into like networking part (latency, throughput, etc.), node processing part (txs, time, etc.), and also the whole system part, to give people some full but quick picture on how well fabric would work :)","username":"baohua","ts":"2017-05-24T13:01:03.528Z"}

{"msg":"Hello, I have been conducting scalability tests on Hyperledger Fabric 1.0.3 where I try to define how TPS and time spent on certain components in the network differ as I increase the number of endorsers. I have came up with some results until now, however there is something strange that I cannot really understand. When a transaction proposal is sent to the peers in parallel, the peers should simulate the transaction and respond back to the client from my understanding. If this is the case all of the endorsing peers should do this in parallel and the total time of client -> peer -> client should not change dramatically when I increase the number of endorsing peers. In my tests I have seen that this time increases linearly inside the peers. Has anyone did such a performance/scalability test or know why this is the case?

{"msg":"With respect to this whole throughput vs goodput, would it make sense to indicate that both need to be measured?  Generally goodput is what users think of when characterizing throughput.  However some systems may not have a linear relationship between throughput and goodput.  Imagine that as a system gets more heavily loaded, while it's throughput may go up linearly, it's goodput may not.  This is especially true as systems are driven into overload conditions.","username":"toddinpal","ts":"2018-02-13T18:10:40.855Z"}
{"msg":"Would it make sense to suggest that throughput must always include the breakdown of transactions with respect to successful or not?  How many were dropped because the messages were malformed.

How many failed due to failed logic checks such as transferring more money than I have or selling something I don't own?","username":"toddinpal","ts":"2018-02-13T18:13:15.150Z"}

Where size is intended to proxy the availability and integrity guarantees of the system. \nFor example a single validator with high throughput does not offer any availability or integrity benefit over a traditional database.\nIn contrast, ethereum mainnet with thousands (?) of validating nodes participating in consensus has very high integrity and availability but relatively low throughput.\nYour example points out this is not real useful expressed as a simple product. A different(?) Todd said he'd put some thought into a way of expressing that relationship. \nI think in an earlier discussion I had suggested a metric like [blockchain work @ network size] with the downside that you are back to showing two numbers which may be confusing.\nI think [other] Todd suggested a slope might be useful.

{"msg":"So I believe the issue we need to deal with is how does finality relate to transaction throughput and latency","username":"toddinpal","ts":"2018-05-08T14:13:48.082Z"}
{"msg":"and this is related to the goodput notion...  Does it make sense to consider transactions that aren't final or transactions that may fail validation as part of the calculations for throughput and latency?","username":"toddinpal","ts":"2018-05-08T14:15:17.363Z"}
{"msg":"Some real world examples:  In Fabric, a poorly designed smart contract may cause most transactions to be endorsed, but fail validation as they all try to modify the same key.  So 100 transactions may be submitted and successfully endorsed in one second, yet 99 of them are invalidated due to MVCC.  Clearly a transaction throughput of 100/sec isn't correct.  Likewise in PoW systems, 100 transactions may be submitted and committed in one second, yet be rolledback 5 minutes later.  What is the throughput then?","username":"toddinpal","ts":"2018-05-08T14:19:49.836Z"}
{"msg":"Do we attempt to graph these relationships?  If so, it is a multidimensional graph with the number of axes greater than 3, ugh.","username":"toddinpal","ts":"2018-05-08T14:21:21.847Z"}
{"msg":"Personally I think if we want to strive for a single number, we only consider transactions that are valid, committed, and final, although that is still problematic with systems that don't have absolute finality.","username":"toddinpal","ts":"2018-05-08T14:24:25.841Z"}
{"msg":"Any other number, i.e., just using submitted or committed transactions can be gamed, and also don't help understand the real throughput or latency","username":"toddinpal","ts":"2018-05-08T14:26:05.513Z"}
{"msg":"Thanks for the free action items @mwagner :P","username":"Dan","ts":"2018-05-08T14:58:40.693Z"}
{"msg":"@toddinpal I agree that only committed transactions should count for throughput. For finality I think we are circling around the bitcoin-ng paper's definitions of epsilon and delta. see section 6.\nhttps://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi16/nsdi16-paper-eyal.pdf\nThe simple version is, at what point do all the validators respond with the same state. \nYou'd want to use tolerances in a public network, but we have an easier problem in measuring permissioned networks because the population and topology are known. ","username":"Dan","ts":"2018-05-08T15:07:49.934Z"}
{"msg":"Uhm - why don't we just say that the \"transaction finality threshold/predicate/function/...\" used is part of the SUT description (maybe with explicit constraints in benchmark definitions and methodological suggestions in our document) and leave it at that? I love fiddling with the measurability of consensus properties as much as the next man (well... maybe even more),  but for me, all this stuff seems to be more technical than necessary. For general-purpose performance comparison of \"distributed ledger services\" (emphasis on service), I would just say \"delay for Txs that are considered final\", \"goodput for Txs that are considered final\", etc. What \"being final\" means is situational, so maybe belongs into SUT definition. The important thing is that its there, so if a vendor tries to pull some *expletive*, it can be called upon its *expletive*.","username":"ikocsis","ts":"2018-05-08T15:52:00.035Z"}

{"msg":"its -> it's","username":"ikocsis","ts":"2018-05-08T15:53:12.567Z"}
{"msg":"@toddinpal - my view is that the throughput, delay and ratio of \"valid, committed and final\" transactions are the _primary_ and truly \"service\" level KPIs, so it's not a problem if we focus on those :) The relationships you are referring to - those seem to be internal affairs of the specific technology. We could even call it \"effective throughput\", but throughput in itself should be enough of a term if we understand it at the application level. For your Fabric example, in my book that's 1 Tx/s and a delay of <1 sec (with default block time). We can debate error rate; one can make an argument that if the clients are conscious of the nature of Fabric MVCC and do a (time-limited) number of retries: the error rate can be zero, throughput a whopping 1 Tx/s and delay a nice biggish number of seconds. For your PoW example: I would say that the \"finality\" criterium should be (correctly) specified in the SUT description (6 blocks, 1 hour, etc.); benchmark/measurement definition should say that a measurement where there are rollbacks beyond that are deemed invalid; and for your example, throughput (effective throughput, goodput, ... whatever we call it) would be 0. And average delay NaN. Does that make sense?","username":"ikocsis","ts":"2018-05-08T16:19:27.240Z"}

{"msg":"\nFrom: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50334489/performance-test-of-the-hyperledger-fabric\n\n\nFabric performance:\nFabric is a queueing system. With a high load, the waiting time increases exponentially (queueing property) and hence the transaction latency. However, for golevelDB, we should get at least 2000 tps with a low latency. \nFrom the CPU utilization plot, it looks like only 16 vCPUs are utilized fully out of 36 vCPUs. What value is set for validatorPoolSize in core.yaml for each peer? You can set this value equal or lesser than the block size and check whether the throughput increases. \nThe performance would differ based on the \n1.\tworkload (fabcar vs fabcoin), \n2.\tdisk (hdd vs ssd, local vs network attached), \n3.\tload generator (CLI vs SDK), \n4.\tload generation method (open system vs closed system (https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/nsdi06/tech/full_papers/schroeder/schroeder.pdf) vs some distribution) and \n5.\tnetwork bandwidth (at least 1.6 Gbps for 2700 tps). \nAlso, ensure that the load generator is not becoming a bottleneck. It would be better the latency can be divided further into (endorsement latency, ordering latency, commit latency) and collect other resource utilization such as network and disk so that the bottleneck can be identified easily.\nYou can refer to our technical paper titled Performance Benchmarking and Optimizing Hyperledger Fabric (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OsIoPtlv5X2PWyOAlDn1FCnHCZPyrF57/view) . We have conducted a comprehensive empirical study. With levelDB, we should get at least 2000 tps with a low latency. \n\n","username":"VipinB","ts":"2018-05-22T13:38:50.354Z"}

{"msg":"@Dan, the Tuxedo reference was with regard to distributed transaction management.  Tuxedo developed the original XA protocol, which is a two phase commit protocol with presumed abort.  XA is used by most middleware offerings to coordinate the updates to multiple resource managers (databases, queuing systems, etc.)  ","username":"toddinpal","ts":"2018-07-10T14:13:15.462Z"}
{"msg":"In first phase of the commit, the transaction coordinator contacts each resource manager and asks them to prepare to commit, meaning that if they acknowledge they are prepared, they must be able to commit when the transaction coordinator tells them to, which usually means holding on to locks, etc.  If any resource manager indicates it can't be prepared, the transaction coordinator tells all the resource managers to rollback their transaction branches.  If they all indicate they can commit, then the transaction coordinator creates a persistent commit log entry and effectively at that point the transaction is committed, i.e., cannot be undone.  The transaction coordinator then tells each of the resource managers to proceed with committing their branches.  The presumed abort bit means that if there is an error, in general things get rolled back.","username":"toddinpal","ts":"2018-07-10T14:18:23.805Z"}

{"msg":"*From Shadow FAQ:  My interpolations are in bold*\nShadow is a network simulator/emulator hybrid. It runs real applications, but it simulates network and system functions thereby emulating the kernel to the application. The suitability of Shadow to your problem depends upon what exactly you are trying to measure. \n*What it can do*: If you are interested in analyzing changes in application behavior, e.g. application layer queuing, failure modes, or design changes, and how those changes affect the operation of the system and network performance, then Shadow seems like a very good choice (especially if you want to minimize work on your end). \n*What it is not intended to do*: If your research relies on, e.g., the accuracy of specific kernel features or kernel parameter settings, or dynamic changes in Internet routing, then Shadow may not be the right choice as it does not precisely model these behaviors. Shadow is also not the best at measuring cryptographic overhead, so if that is desired then it should probably be done more directly as a separate research component.","username":"VipinB","ts":"2018-10-16T16:56:59.015Z"}

There's another interesting bit that the code is going to be in rust (which compiles into wasm) so also if a platform doesn't want to use web assembly they could fork the rust and shim in their own native framework interface.

{"msg":"Hi All! I have a question about finality and the latency@threshold metric (in the context of Fabric and its support in Caliper). \n\nProblem: even if a transaction successfully goes through the consensus flow, there is the possibility of a transient error happening during actually committing the transaction or its entire encapsulating block (e.g., some DB access error). I think (but not exactly sure) that these kind of situations are signaled by a special error in Fabric, in which case the peer halts the processing of further transactions/blocks, and initiates some recovery protocol. \n\nScenario: (at least) one peer confirms the success of a transaction, but other peers run into some transient error, notifying the client (Caliper in this case) about an unsuccessful transaction. But Fabric will _eventually_ synchronize the successful transactions across the network. \n\nQuestion 1) Should the transaction be considered as successful? (I think yes. It's committed on at least one peer and will be syncronized to faulty peers eventually.)\n\nQuestion 2) How do we calculate the latency@threshold metric in this case? Say we have the timestamps for 9 successful events and 1 unsuccessful one. Calculating latency@90% is no problem in this case. But if the percentage of nodes that successfully committed the transaction is below the threshold, then we don't have enough timing data to calculate the metric.\n\nAny insight is greatly appreciated! :)","username":"klenik","ts":"2019-01-28T16:47:26.626Z"}
{"msg":"@klenik we debated this question for many days in the finality debate; decided to go with the following separation probabilistic finality vs non-probabilistic; in the first case there can be a re-org and hence the transaction could be non-durable because of a fork. The case of Fabric is the second where the latency@threshold metric may not make sense; in any case the slower diffusion due to faults (which is what you bring up) may point to bigger problems and may not be fixed until the underlying faults are fixed.

Adopt what name the TSC comes up with 3. Take another look at the metrics paper to update it or make it a living document. 4. Continue having presentations.\nVipin said that these presentations could yield greater truths applicable to all blockchains like work on microservices to scale blockchain nodes a la fastfabric, have aggregators or pre-processing to create more throughput (like accelerator) and have greater focus on datastore performance through caching to remove a bottleneck or all of the above to improve BC throughput.\nWe also agreed to work more closely with caliper.\nTPS or RPS in a stressed DLT (Dano Ferrin suggests above) \n","username":"VipinB","ts":"2019-11-06T01:58:10.228Z"}
