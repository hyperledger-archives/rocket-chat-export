@manoranjith, how come the tickets you've just added to [perun-node](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/perun-node) don't show up in the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger-labs/projects/1)?
</p>
<p><strong>manoranjith</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 08:05:10 GMT):<br/>
I am yet to set up the automation for  the project board to include the newly added issues. 

I have added them manually for now and you they should show up in the project board.
</p>
<p><strong>choeppler</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 10:52:23 GMT):<br/>
Okay, thanks.
I was asking because I  thought at least the newly created ones would show up in the board that way it's configured at the moment...
</p>
<p><strong>manoranjith</strong> (Mon, 14 Sep 2020 11:04:32 GMT):<br/>
Okay, for some reason it didn't. Will have a look into it.

Hi, 

I was trying to update `perun-node` to use the shared nonce feature. But I am not able to figure out how to send the nonce share when accepting a channel proposal.
1. I found the [`NewChannelProposalAcc`](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/go-perun/blob/4bede739a3e4ce208390203ddd75aa3e2eb968b3/client/proposalmsgs.go#L265), to which I can pass `WithRandomNonce` as option and receive a `client.ChannelProposalAcc`.  
2. But [`ProposalResponder.Accept`](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/go-perun/blob/dev/client/proposal.go#L82) takes a only a `client.ProposalAcc` as a parameter.

Hi, 
Previously the [board](https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger-labs/projects/1) was configured using [Github Automation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/configuring-automation-for-project-boards), but i found few limitations with it. 
Now i have set it up to use the [project bot](https://github.com/apps/project-bot) and it seems to work now.
</p>
<p><strong>manoranjith</strong> (Wed, 16 Sep 2020 11:39:49 GMT):<br/>
On creating new issues, the project should be explicitly added to the issue. Then it will appear in the `To Do (Backlog)` column of the project board.
</p>
<p><strong>sebstar</strong> (Wed, 16 Sep 2020 12:44:57 GMT):<br/>
Hi, that was a mistake on our side when we recently changed the API of channel proposals on the `dev` branch. We just merged a fix where `ProposalResponder.Accept` now correctly receives a `client.ChannelProposalAcc` message, which must be created using method `NewChannelProposalAcc` on the proposal request. Note that we will probably change the API here once more before our next "Europa" release, where we implement full sub-channel support (not directly relevant to the node, but allows to "run" apps in channels).
</p>
<p><strong>choeppler</strong> (Wed, 16 Sep 2020 13:19:55 GMT):<br/>
I see. So, in other words, regardless of the [board's](https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger-labs/projects/1) linked repositories, issues appear once their project property points to the board, don't they?
</p>
<p><strong>manoranjith</strong> (Wed, 16 Sep 2020 13:28:14 GMT):<br/>
As I noticed from the [github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-repository-to-a-project-board), issues & pull requests can be added the to project board whether it is linked or not.

However, the automation will work only for the linked repositories: `perun node` and `perun doc`.
</p>
<p><strong>manoranjith</strong> (Wed, 16 Sep 2020 13:28:53 GMT):<br/>
Okay, I will try using the updated version.
</p>
<p><strong>manoranjith</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 07:36:23 GMT):<br/>
I was trying to use the persistence feature in go-perun and have one query: When a channel client is persisted and restored, what happens to the message bus ?
Should the participants of the `to be restored channels` be registered in the message bus before restoring the channels ? If so, how to get the list of participants to be registered ?
</p>
<p><strong>manoranjith</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 07:39:20 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>sebstar</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 12:27:45 GMT):<br/>
@manoranjith I pushed an [intermediate release `v0.4.1`](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/go-perun/releases/tag/v0.4.1) with the features included that we discussed last week.
</p>
<p><strong>sebstar</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 12:38:56 GMT):<br/>
You mean their IP addresses registered in the dialer?
</p>
<p><strong>manoranjith</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 14:15:01 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>sebstar</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 14:23:27 GMT):<br/>
Not necessarily before, I think. But the moment the first wire message is sent, the tcp/ip wire.Bus implementation will try to dial and fail if the peer is unknown.
But don't you load the list of known peers with their IP addresses at start anyways? I would configure the tcp/ip dialer before setting up any client.
</p>
<p><strong>manoranjith</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 14:29:14 GMT):<br/>
In case of outgoing connections,  the IP address is registered in the dialer when a user wants to open a channel with that peer. 

In case of restore, the first possible instance to register a peer with dialer is within the `OnNewChannel` callback.

Hence wanted to clarify if the framework will try to use the message bus before a channel is processed in the `OnNewChannel` callback.
</p>
<p><strong>sebstar</strong> (Wed, 23 Sep 2020 14:41:02 GMT):<br/>
I think it's fine to do it there for now... why can't you just add the ip addresses of all known peers before restoring client?
</p>
<p><strong>manoranjith</strong> (Thu, 24 Sep 2020 07:38:05 GMT):<br/>
Okay, I think I will try doing it this way now.

Currently we use contacts from yaml file and hence it may not make much difference whether is is loaded on demand or all of them before restoring..

But when we might move to other contact sources, which might have large number of known peers, then loading on demand will be a better option.

I have a query regarding what happens when a channel is in Funding phase and the other party doesn't fund within expected time.

Within `ch.Settle` the function calls sequence is: `channel.settleLocked` -> `channel.settle` -> `channel.register` (because machine is `Funding` phase and `Funding` < `Registered`) -> `machine.SetRegistering` -> `statemachine.SetRegistering`.

And hence `ch.settle` will return an error, thereby  Is this an expected behavior ? Or should the condition check be `m.Phase <= Funding` ?

Isn't it the other way around? The link you posted shows that it _fails_ if `m.Phase < Funding`, but, as you say, it is at `Funding`, it won't fail.

Yeah, it is the other way around🤦‍♂️, if the condition check fails, the `statemachine.SetRegistering` executes the happy path.

Hi @sebstar,

I looking at the proposal validation logic [here](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/go-perun/blob/ffba499fdb4e1bc6d954426d9346a5de5306060f/client/proposal.go#L246).

Is the a specific reason why the indices should be fixed: Proposer at 0 and the Proposee at 1 ?
</p>
<p><strong>sebstar</strong> (Thu, 01 Oct 2020 13:09:33 GMT):<br/>
It was just much easier to implement the protocol when this was fixed. We're not aware of any application where this is a problem.
</p>
<p><strong>manoranjith</strong> (Thu, 01 Oct 2020 13:14:16 GMT):<br/>
Okay, I was getting an error when I was not putting the proposer address at index 0 and was just curious about the reason behind it. Wasn't a problem though.

Hi @sebstar 

I have been trying to use nil app in channels and stuck at this point. 
I am using 75f39a5c (tagged v0.4.1}.

Scenario 1:
I use 'NewLedgerChannelProposal' to create a channel proposal  `pclient.WithApp(nil,pchannel.NoData)` with this option. Then if I print the channel proposal, the App field is not nil, but initialized to zero value. 
So when I consequently call `pclient.ProposeChannel`, the program panics as `App.Def()` is called at `backend/ethereum/channel/backend.go:L117`,  
```
if p.App != nil {
app = ethwallet.AsEthAddr(p.Add.Def())
}
```

The same is the case, even if I don't use `WithApp`  option in `NewLedgerChannelProposal`. 

Scenario 2:

I explicitly set app to nil in the channel proposal returned by `NewLedgerChannelProposal`, before passing it to `ProposeChannel`. 


The I get an error, because `ValidateProposalParameters` in `pchannel/params.go` checks that app should not be nil. 

Not: In pchannel, pclient etc., prefix p just refers that its a package in go-perun.

</p>
<p><strong>sebstar</strong> (Fri, 16 Oct 2020 13:00:47 GMT):<br/>
`nil` is not a valid app, or appdef. If you just omit the `WithApp` option, it should create a proposal without an app, that is, with a `NoApp`.  You can also explicitly set `WithApp(channel.NoApp(), channel.NoData())`. The latest `dev` also contains an explicit option for that, `WithoutApp()`. We never use `nil` because this always leads to unforeseen problems in public APIs.
</p>
<p><strong>manoranjith</strong> (Fri, 16 Oct 2020 15:40:19 GMT):<br/>
I tried channel.NoApp option as you have described...  Program panics for the reason described in scenario 1 above. 

Because channel.NoApp sets the app to zero value, but in snippet in (go-perun), Def is called on zero value app.... Which causes it to panic

A second issue: CircleCI should not try to build the `gh-pages`-branch. That's why the [other build](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/hyperledger-labs/perun-doc/9/workflows/d1299f9c-7872-45f1-8d19-b6fd4146c316/jobs/10) failed...

<p><strong>choeppler</strong> (Tue, 08 Dec 2020 09:11:44 GMT):<br/>
@manoranjith, I just created a PR in the perun-docs repo, https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/perun-doc/pull/35. CircleCI ran the deploy target (which it shouldn't for a pr) and that build failed due to the same reason detailed above. (Cf. https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/hyperledger-labs/perun-doc/14/workflows/0aed9019-f256-442a-8b3f-933f21177433/jobs/17)
Could you have a look into this, please?
</p>
<p><strong>choeppler</strong> (Tue, 08 Dec 2020 09:27:19 GMT):<br/>
fixed after rebasing to master where the CircleCI-config updates were just integrated.
Thanks, @manoranjith !

<p><strong>manoranjith</strong> (Tue, 08 Dec 2020 09:34:20 GMT):<br/>
Okay. There was an update need to circle ci config.... Hence it was failing before
</p>
<p><strong>manoranjith</strong> (Tue, 08 Dec 2020 09:36:40 GMT):<br/>
I have updated the circle ci config to run jobs based on branches. You can find the details in this commit: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/perun-doc/commit/4771373a9f01d25fdff3ab524ce93b6a8ada21a1

It also includes excluding gh-pages branch.
</p>
<p><strong>choeppler</strong> (Tue, 08 Dec 2020 10:31:00 GMT):<br/>
Hm. it seems we still have to include a config in the gh-pages branch to exclude building that branch???

Hi

I was trying to simulate the case where I can get FundingTimeoutError with the following steps:
1. Start ganache-cli node with insufficient funds for one of the channel participants
2. Run `Test_Role_Integ` in `perun-node/session` package.

I noticed that, in all three combinations (Y -> has sufficient funds, N -> does not)
Alice: Y  |   N  |  N
Bob : N  |   Y  |  N

I see to get the same error for both alice and bob: `funding ledger channel: error while funding channel: sending 0th funding TX for asset 0: sending transaction: context canceled`. 

Should i not receive a `FudingTimeoutError` in this case, as one of the channel participants was not able to send the funding tx in time ?
</p>
<p><strong>mano-ranjith</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 10:08:49 GMT):<br/>
Hi

Also I am thinking on how to detect a `Transaction Timed Out` error in go-perun. One  possibility I was if `bind.WaitMined` call within `ConfirmTransaction` function [here](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/go-perun/blob/37f6187c1df8d05409853c4eb7301a384f12923b/backend/ethereum/channel/contractbackend.go#L132) returns an error, can we consider that the transaction has not been received within the expected time ?

I tried to reproduce this but because of several limitations in the simulated block chain it did not work. Which means that we can not test it :cry: 
Will try out your code next.
</p>
<p><strong>OliverTY</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 14:48:28 GMT):<br/>
The go-ethereum documentation is not helpful on that, would need to look at the source.

>Should i not receive a FudingTimeoutError in this case, as one of the channel participants was not able to send the funding tx in time ?
yes, if someone else did not fund in time.
I case youself could not fund, the error is different AFAIK.

<p><strong>mano-ranjith</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 15:08:40 GMT):<br/>
To try out, you can
1. Clone the repo with below commands.
`git clone https://github.com/boschresearch/dst-go.git`
`cd dst-go/session`

2. Start the ganache-cli node using the below command.
`ganache-cli -b 1 --account="0x1fedd636dbc7e8d41a0622a2040b86fea8842cef9d4aa4c582aad00465b7acff,100000000000000000000" --account="0xb0309c60b4622d3071fad3e16c2ce4d0b1e7758316c187754f4dd0cfb44ceb33,100000000000000000000"`

3. Run the specific test. I have commented out a large part of this, so that it runs only until the point where channel is proposed and accepted.
`go test -count=1 -tags=integration  -v -run Test_Integ_Role`

In the first run, the test will pass.
Then you can try each of the three combinations by modifying the initial balance when starting ganache-cli node.

Alice: Y | N | N
Bob : N | Y | N

In the command specified above, each of them get 100 ETH. Since the channel opening balance is 2,2 ETH; if you remove 2 zeros for any of the participant, that participant will have insufficient balance.

Note that, since they still will have 1 ETH each, it was be sufficient to deploy contracts during test setup

@OliverTY
</p>
<p><strong>mano-ranjith</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 15:15:42 GMT):<br/>
But in all cases (either I did not fund or the peer did not fund), I receive the same error that is mentioned above.
</p>
<p><strong>mano-ranjith</strong> (Fri, 12 Mar 2021 09:58:58 GMT):<br/>
Hi @OliverTY 

I tried to investigate this error in more detail. It seems to be a problem in how transactions are handled by `ganache-cli`. 

If we send both the funding transactions next to one another, both of them are not mined by ganache-cli

But, if we send one funding transaction, wait for it to be mined / fail and then send the second transaction, then it works as expected. We get funding transaction error for one alice and peers did not fund error for bob.
</p>
<p><strong>mano-ranjith</strong> (Fri, 12 Mar 2021 10:00:14 GMT):<br/>
To achieve the second case, i added a 2 second sleep before calling fund in `go-perun/client/proposal.go:189`
</p>
<p><strong>mano-ranjith</strong> (Fri, 12 Mar 2021 10:05:30 GMT):<br/>
In the same branch, I have mentioned above, i have committed these changes.

First you can start ganache-cli node with the command mentioned above with 1ETH for alice, 10 ETH for bob.

Then from session directory, if you run `go test -cover -p 1 -count=1 -tags=integration  -v -run Test_Integ_Role`

On commit f7a4e3 you will get funding error for both alice and bob.

On commit 2ec38b (where i had added a sleep), you will get funding error for alice and peer timed out funding error for bob.

After @matthiasgeihs merged https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/perun-doc/pull/58, CircleCI didn't build and deploy master. I didn't see an easy way to manually trigger a CircleCI-build. So, I rebuilt locally for the time being.

There was a note on the Hyperledger Labs mailing list, that lab repos should move from master to main for the default branch. (https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/labs/message/145)
We've got [five repos](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Ahyperledger-labs+perun) which are affected:
- hyperledger-labs/go-perun
- hyperledger-labs/perun-doc
- hyperledger-labs/perun-eth-contracts
- hyperledger-labs/perun-node
- hyperledger-labs/perun-proposals

I've already renamed `master` to `main` in the doc, node, and proposals repos via the web interface as described [here](https://github.com/github/renaming)

@MatthiasGeihs.Perun, do you want me to do so for the remaining repos as well or are you going to take care of that?
</p>
<p><strong>choeppler</strong> (Tue, 03 Aug 2021 21:30:44 GMT):<br/>
I came across [repolinter](https://github.com/todogroup/repolinter/) recently and used it to lint the [perun-node](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/perun-node) repo using the configuration documented in the pull request https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/perun-node/pull/222. @rjones , could you have a quick look at the PR to check whether I picked up the right config and the proposed fix looks as expected?
</p>
<p><strong>MatthiasGeihs.Perun</strong> (Tue, 12 Oct 2021 08:48:02 GMT):<br/>
Hi @rjones , we just released a new blockchain backend for Perun, bringing Perun to the Cosmos Network. The backend is contained in two repositories:
- The CosmWasm smart contract: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-cosmwasm-contract
- The Perun Backend: https://github.com/perun-network/perun-cosmwasm-backend

@choeppler proposed that we make these part of Hyperledger and mentioned that you, @rjones, could help us move the repositories to the Hyperledger Organization on GitHub. Could you give us some guidance on what needs to be done?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 12 Oct 2021 15:45:34 GMT):<br/>
@MatthiasGeihs.Perun the easiest way is to transfer them to me on GitHub - `ryjones` - and then I'll transfer them. If you're uncomfortable with that, you can make me an owner of the repos, and I can try to transfer them directly from `perun-network`
