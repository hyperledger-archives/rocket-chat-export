{"msg":"Dear All in the Hyperledger Public Sector Working Group - \n\nThanks for your participation in today's very informative call. We had 21 participants, some of which were groups, so it is heartening to see our community grow to encompass representation from all around the globe.\n\nSpecial thanks to Bobbi Muscara, for pulling together these informative educational resources on explaining blockchain to lay audiences. Please note that these materials are in the mailing list and chat.\n\nAlso special Thanks to John Jordan and Olena Mitovska, from British Columbia and Ontario, Canada respectively. We enjoyed the overview of how province governments, along with the national government of Canada, are working together collaboratively to develop The Org Book - putting diverse, verifiable business credentials in an accessible format, undergirded by blockchain structure.\n\nAnyone with additional questions for our presenters today, please share them here in our email digest, or in the group Rocket Chat. \n\nFor our next call on Friday, August 17th:\n\nWe are looking forward to learning from Pete Teigen of IBM Global Business Services, who will share experiences with Hyperledger implementations in Delaware.\n\nWe also look forward to a group expertise sharing session with the UN in Uzbekistan, which is working on a land registration programme. (To be confirmed)\n\nRequest for support:\nWould anyone on this group like to help us keep our Use Case wiki up to date? Every call we have a Zoom recording and slide presentations. It would be great if others could access the materials and learn after the fact by visiting our group wiki: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/public-sector-wg/public-sector-wg\n\nPlease let me know if you'd be willing to help with this important documentation support.\n\nThanks and best wishes for the weekend to all!\n\nRose","username":"roseshuman","ts":"2018-08-03T15:27:39.208Z"}

{"msg":"Greetings,\n\nMy name is Pat and I am preparing to write a thesis in computer science starting one year from now. I have not finalized a thesis topic. However, I am interested in documenting a set of regression and machine learning techniques for analyzing Hyperledger transactions. Granted the nature of the transactions will demand different types of analysis but I am most interested in doing this from a blockchain perspective.\n\nI am not experienced with Hyperledger or blockchain technology yet. I plan to prepare for the thesis over the next year by learning Hyperledger. Are there any large public Hyperledger transaction data sets that I can access with permission from the owning organization in exchange for an ongoing analysis of the data? A not-for-profit organization would be ideal but I welcome the input if you know where I can access a large data set. Thank you for your input.","username":"patmc","ts":"2019-02-01T22:58:27.275Z"}
