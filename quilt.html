yes, how do you want to import the code? does your current codebase have DCOs on every commit? usually we need a squash commit to import the code base

@earizon not right now. I know there is a desire to bring java-ilp-connector over so perhaps this would be a sub-module of that?

<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 09:08:12 GMT):<br/>
@adrianhopebailie Actually all the ilp-routing in the JS code is used only by the ilp-connector. So including in "inside" the java-ilp-connector makes sense. Anyway I will try to create some working code myself and let you know about success/problems.
</p>
<p><strong>adrianhopebailie</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 10:27:51 GMT):<br/>
Cool, are you going to try and do it with Kotlin?
</p>
<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 10:56:25 GMT):<br/>
I'll use plain java for interfaces and Kotlin for implementation. (I've been playing also with lombok, that "imports" many of the goodies of Kotlin to standar java, but I think Kotlin is cleaner -and having official support of Google for Android offers me a greater confidence-)
</p>
<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 11:26:44 GMT):<br/>
Actually I'm observing that the algorithms used in LiquidityCurves are relatively complex from a mathematical point of view and gives place for different implementations. This is a good point to define everything in terms of interfaces and not take many assumptions about concrete implementation.
</p>
<p><strong>adrianhopebailie</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 13:11:43 GMT):<br/>
I wouldn't spend too much time on the liquidity curves stuff . Why not use a linear rate to start and get the connector working like that. The work on the liquidity curves is complex and will probably change soon :(
</p>
<p><strong>sappenin</strong> (Sat, 28 Oct 2017 00:53:46 GMT):<br/>
Also, see ExchangeRateProvider in Javan.money as an alternative interface to LiquidityCurve. It’s more complicated, but well thought out and quite flexible - if we’re looking for an FX interface that we might want to have multiple implementations of, we should consider that.
</p>
<p><strong>sappenin</strong> (Sat, 28 Oct 2017 00:54:27 GMT):<br/>
That should be “javax.money” in my comment above.

@adrianhopebailie , @sappenin thx for the remarks!

<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Mon, 30 Oct 2017 08:27:31 GMT):<br/>
FYI: I just created a first translation from JS-code to Java Interfaces: https://github.com/earizon/quilt/tree/earizon-ilp-routing-core/ilp-routing-core/src/main/java/org/interledger/routing/specs. 

The choosen ilp-routing-core module and org.interledger.routing.specs are something-like arbitrary, just to have some an  starting point for code.

I think this code is an over-abuse of interface and abstraction:

https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt/blob/master/ilp-core/src/main/java/org/interledger/ilqp/LiquidityPoint.java 

135 lines of code to store two (inmutable) BigIntegers!!!!
Does anybody really think anyone will be interested in creating different implementations to store two BigIntegers and use a build factory and defaults implementations for such an extremely simple thing?

Why not just creating a simple data-access-object and put development efforts in detecting null-pointers at compile-time? In fact https://immutables.github.io is already defined as a dependency in https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt/blob/master/ilp-core/pom.xml.


</p>
<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Fri, 03 Nov 2017 10:42:03 GMT):<br/>
Is there any good reason to torture developers with abstractions?
</p>
<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Sun, 05 Nov 2017 21:13:12 GMT):<br/>
Playing with https://checkerframework.org. Among others this static code analysis tools detects NullPointers at **compile** time. Again the builder pattern to return simple data object forces to nearly duplicate the code in the builder and the Impl (See changes at https://github.com/earizon/quilt/tree/earizon-checker-framework). The alternative option is to mark everything as @Nullable and loose all the advantages of the checker framework to detect code errors.

@earizon I agree - we did a test-run of  https://immutables.github.io for the BTP code, and it worked quite well. I think the intention is to use Immutables on all of our POJOs to remove much of the boilerplate in the projects.

</p>
<p><strong>sappenin</strong> (Fri, 10 Nov 2017 18:42:26 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, I guess that's possible - I'm traveling and am in a different timezone than usual, so my software might be misleading me. That said, our previous meeting was usually at 8am PST before we joined Hyperleger - but the new meeting is now scheduled at 7am PST.

<p><strong>sappenin</strong> (Sat, 11 Nov 2017 22:21:03 GMT):<br/>
Ah, that's probably what's going on - PST has DST, but UTC does not. I wouldn't mind moving to 4pm UTC until the March, but understand if that's a silly proposal since it only benefits me.  :)

hi folks
</p>
<p><strong>nathanaw</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 16:00:26 GMT):<br/>
i wish to develop on quilt
</p>
<p><strong>nathanaw</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 16:00:36 GMT):<br/>
which IDE is your favourite?
</p>
<p><strong>nathanaw</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 16:01:50 GMT):<br/>
also, how does one contribute to testnet of testnets?
</p>
<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 16:33:31 GMT):<br/>
@nathanaw I think we are all using IntelliJ right now, but the core building tool is maven, so any IDE will work. (IntelliJ is definitely better if you also want to work on Kotlin code)

For the testnet of testnet the idea is to develop connectors in java compliant with the existing deployed (nodeJS) nodes.
</p>
<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 16:34:13 GMT):<br/>
(I'm not aware of any running compatible java connector yet)
</p>
<p><strong>nathanaw</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 16:34:58 GMT):<br/>
thank you @earizon ! also another question on fragility and infrastructure. How does quilt handle HA and avoid SPOF? meaning the underlying infrastructure if > X% fails, then the entire network fails.  
</p>
<p><strong>nathanaw</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 16:35:52 GMT):<br/>
hi all, is there interoperability for smart contracts of different platforms in quilt?
</p>
<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 16:40:30 GMT):<br/>
@nathanaw smart-contracts can mean many different things. Quilt is restricted to "moving" assets from ledger to ledger. If the smart-contracts can be seen as a ledger (with balances for users) then the Interledger Protocol (Quilt is just an implementation of it) can be used. An smart-contract handling Identity management or probe-of-existence,... has no relation to assets/ledgers so can not be made inter-operable with Inter*ledger* Quilt.
</p>
<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 16:42:51 GMT):<br/>
HA is not specified. The core libraries can be used to help different connector/ledger-compliant/wallets/.. implementations. HA is provided by the implementation. The protocol itself just warrant that if a system is down sender and receiver will not loose money (== local assets in its ledger/smart-contract/blockchain/...). 
</p>
<p><strong>nathanaw</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 16:43:57 GMT):<br/>
@earizon thanks for your answers! for the plugins i create, how does one test them? currently are we having some AWS platform to test this or?
</p>
<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 16:46:21 GMT):<br/>
Notice that before creating a plugin you need first create a connector. This a non-mandatory schema on how the current NodeJS connector are designed:
https://gist.github.com/earizon/1abf96106d2af54db1b62c3441fd95dc
</p>
<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 16:47:27 GMT):<br/>
so you have a "core" in charge of routing payments ("moving assets") and then plugins are used to communicate with each specific ledger, blockchain, ...
</p>
<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Mon, 13 Nov 2017 16:48:58 GMT):<br/>
I think (not 100% sure) that if you develop a connector and the BTP pluggin you will be able to easily integrate into the "Testnet of Testnets"

Is there any list of plugin/connector that one can build? or any issues that one can help to fix? or specifications that I can help to write?

Out of the modules below, what should one work on first?

dev-ops
crypto-conditions
ilp-core
ilp-annotations

Please let me know.

<p><strong>michielbdejong</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 10:45:29 GMT):<br/>
@earizon can you update me on what we would need to do to connect a Quilt connector to the Interledger testnet? E.g. should we use BTP or HTTP for its API?
</p>
<p><strong>bmalavan</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 11:08:28 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 13:01:28 GMT):<br/>
@michielbdejong  Basically a BTP or HTTP plugin implemented in java, that will have the same behaviour than the existing BTP/HTTP plugins in JS. Could you indicate the github URLs for the existing implementations of the Javascript plugins (ILPv4 if possible to work with the incomming version) ?
</p>
<p><strong>michielbdejong</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 16:28:03 GMT):<br/>
@earizon the only big change to be aware of is that the destination amount is now no longer visible at each hop. Other than that, it doesn't matter much if one transfer in a payment goes over BTP/WebSocket, and another transfer in that same payment actually goes over HTTP.
</p>
<p><strong>michielbdejong</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 16:29:24 GMT):<br/>
So I think the best thing to do would be if we just agree on a super-simple http API, that's easy to implement in Java, and then I can codec that in Amundsen.
</p>
<p><strong>michielbdejong</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 16:40:23 GMT):<br/>
Is there a connector I can run?
</p>
<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Fri, 05 Jan 2018 20:12:00 GMT):<br/>
@michielbdejong Not yet! I (we) started the other way arround with some ledger with HTLA support and now developing a connector, but I guess we have to change many things to adapt to ILPv4, so I will try to have a "mock-but-functional" connector ASAP. Maybe @sappenin has also make some independent progress with its own connector. 
</p>
<p><strong>michielbdejong</strong> (Sat, 06 Jan 2018 10:42:05 GMT):<br/>
I think the only two changes you need is making your ledger strongly-enlightened as per https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/issues/356#issuecomment-352532810 and supporting best-effort forwarding of Interledger payments.
</p>
<p><strong>SaiChaitanya</strong> (Mon, 08 Jan 2018 12:45:24 GMT):<br/>
Quick question, where is the development being done right now? in the hyperledger-quilt or interledger... there seem to be open issues on both projects on github?

<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 11:35:29 GMT):<br/>
Looking at the JS activity (https://github.com/interledgerjs/ilp-plugin-btp), I think the idea to implement rfc issue 359 is to use a base parent BTP plugin that can be adapted to any type of trust-line/payment-channel by child class. Is that correct?
The BTP acronym confuses me because I thought that "ILPv4" supersedes "BTP", but it still makes sense to me to implement using this way, or maybe I'm lost. 

From a practical point of view, my doubt is whether to implement a BTP-packet in quilt. (I think that's the case, but not 100% sure after all the ILP-enlightment changes)
</p>
<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 11:38:10 GMT):<br/>
Otherwise said, using a developper friendly language:

Issue 359 == https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/issues/359 "==" https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/pull/364  "=?" https://github.com/interledgerjs/ilp-plugin-btp 
</p>
<p><strong>michielbdejong</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 04:39:32 GMT):<br/>
> whether to implement a BTP-packet in quilt
We can choose! :) BTP is just a wrapper around ILP packets that makes it easier to send them over WebSockets. So our first choice is, do we want Quilt to use WebSockets or HTTP for its API? I would vote for HTTP. @earizon @adrianhopebailie @sappenin @nathanaw what would be your preference?
</p>
<p><strong>michielbdejong</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 04:42:28 GMT):<br/>
I guess advantage of HTTP is that it's easier. Advantage of WebSockets is that it allows a client (so a computer that's not publicly addressable, e.g. a laptop or phone) to be a receiver, and that some JavaScript-based connectors may only support WebSockets (but if a JavaScript-based connector wants to peer with a Java-based one, it would be easy to add ilp-plugin-http)
</p>
<p><strong>michielbdejong</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 04:57:13 GMT):<br/>
To answer your question about ilp-plugin-btp, it's indeed confusing that we still call it BTP without differentiating; I think maybe we should call it BTP/2.0, see https://github.com/interledgerjs/ilp-plugin-btp/issues/2
</p>
<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 17:47:36 GMT):<br/>
As I understand HTTP-ILP is just used for http clients to http server payments (using always? XRP as settlement ledger), so for the general case of a connector that wants to forward payments in an ILP-network only BTP would work.



</p>
<p><strong>michielbdejong</strong> (Fri, 12 Jan 2018 07:46:32 GMT):<br/>
@earizon ah sorry, I meant ilp-over-http, as described in https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/pull/349, not http-ilp (those names are too similar, definitely! :) )
</p>
<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Fri, 12 Jan 2018 10:22:14 GMT):<br/>
@michielbdejong +1. OK, I'm developing a mock connector (everything is in RAM memory and network connections are just simulated). Once I manage to have something stable I will start replacing with real ilp-over-http(s) connections and messages. I let you now once something is worth to look at. 
</p>
<p><strong>michielbdejong</strong> (Fri, 12 Jan 2018 10:26:13 GMT):<br/>
@earizon awesome! I'm deploying https://github.com/interledgerjs/ilp-plugin-mini-accounts/blob/master/index.js#L142 now
</p>
<p><strong>michielbdejong</strong> (Fri, 12 Jan 2018 10:29:02 GMT):<br/>
so that's the WebSocket variant, but I'll deploy the http variant as well, so we can test.
</p>
<p><strong>michielbdejong</strong> (Fri, 12 Jan 2018 10:30:05 GMT):<br/>
@earizon are you following https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/pull/349 exactly? Are there any ambiguities in there where you need to make a choice?
</p>
<p><strong>michielbdejong</strong> (Fri, 12 Jan 2018 10:32:23 GMT):<br/>
Take care that ILP-Amount is the local transfer amount, *not* the destination amount that used to exist inside the type-1 payment packet, you know that, right?
</p>
<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Fri, 12 Jan 2018 12:55:13 GMT):<br/>
@sappenin I was having a first quick look at https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt/pull/65 (Initial Commit of jackson-datatypes module).
Since now Quilt is using the immutables library and immutables already has built-in support for JSON (https://immutables.github.io/json.html) maybe this code can be simplified?
</p>
<p><strong>michielbdejong</strong> (Fri, 12 Jan 2018 13:08:38 GMT):<br/>
@earizon I just built https://github.com/michielbdejong/ilp-plugin-http, it can act as Alice (a http client) or as Bob (a http server). Is there something to test yet on the Quilt side? Shall I try to set up my IDE to compile Quilt on my laptop?
</p>
<p><strong>michielbdejong</strong> (Fri, 12 Jan 2018 13:08:57 GMT):<br/>
Or is your in-RAM connector independent from the Quilt codebase?
</p>
<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Fri, 12 Jan 2018 13:15:44 GMT):<br/>
@michielbdejong Not yet. I'll try to have something testable for next week. I'm working on an initial java  KISS connector with some config and plugable infraestructure, async code ... But the RFC changes to ILPv4 has slow me down.
</p>
<p><strong>michielbdejong</strong> (Fri, 12 Jan 2018 13:19:35 GMT):<br/>
ok, there is a voice call on Wednesday, right?

</p>
<p><strong>michielbdejong</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 12:27:11 GMT):<br/>
@earizon this is the code I mentioned in the meeting yesterday: https://github.com/michielbdejong/ilp-java-example
So far the connector only applies its transaction fee, it does not yet check the fulfillment's correctness and timeliness, nor does it keep track of unsecuredAmounts yet. I'll see if I can add those features, to make the example a bit more interesting.

"error in the RFC" is always a tricky concept, one person's "error" is another person's "on purpose" :)
</p>
<p><strong>michielbdejong</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 18:49:00 GMT):<br/>
can we do WebSockets in Java? then we could convert receiver.js to receiver.java :)

<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 19:18:35 GMT):<br/>
@michielbdejong Yes, WebSockets is available in VertX. One example ussage in the (now deprecated) java ledger is here:
https://github.com/everis-innolab/interledger-ledger/blob/master/src/main/java/com/everis/everledger/handlers/AsyncMessageHandlers.kt
Actually is not Java, but Kotlin  (Kotlin == "Java fixed")
</p>
<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 19:27:49 GMT):<br/>
@michielbdejong is there any way to visualize (a console log could be enough) the connectors through which a payment is passing/has passed in the testnet-of-testnets.  I've been requested by some mates at Everis to make a short demo next monday, and it would be interesing to show the payment path.

<p><strong>michielbdejong</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 15:27:57 GMT):<br/>
@earizon you would have the tcp dump from `sh ./sendData.sh` in one screen, and the output of `node receiver.js` in another.
</p>
<p><strong>michielbdejong</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 15:28:10 GMT):<br/>
When I run it myself, I also look at the server logs on Amundsen over ssh :)
</p>
<p><strong>michielbdejong</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 15:28:53 GMT):<br/>
the payment path is curl -> everconnector -> amundsen -> receiver.js, right?
</p>
<p><strong>michielbdejong</strong> (Fri, 26 Jan 2018 15:29:20 GMT):<br/>
how would you want to visualize that, show scrolling logs or something more 2-dimensional?

@earizon do you need anything more for your demo today? and what will be our next step now that we have this working?
</p>
<p><strong>michielbdejong</strong> (Mon, 29 Jan 2018 10:15:10 GMT):<br/>
@adrianhopebailie did you see https://github.com/everis-innolab/ilp-everconnector? How do you see it relating to the work you did on the Quilt repo this weekend?
</p>
<p><strong>ahmedhamid</strong> (Tue, 30 Jan 2018 11:14:56 GMT):<br/>
Hi Michiel. This is Ahmed. I have sent an email before asking for pointers to start from in Quilt. Actually, I have started going through the RFCs and tutorials on interledger.org to get the full picture. Any more tips? Thank you a lot :)
</p>
<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Tue, 30 Jan 2018 11:33:26 GMT):<br/>
@michielbdejong Hi Michiel, Sorry for the late reply. My work-mates (Miguel and Morjan) are planning to have a full SPSP "stack" in java. From the client point of view I think that all that need is to update the https://github.com/interledger/java-spsp-client-spring. 
I will try myself to get in sync with the latests commits in Quilt and to try to use the master branch (and Maven public repositorys), removing custom branches and manual build steps. I'm in mode "system-overload" at this moment. Hope to have something "OK" for Friday.
</p>
<p><strong>earizon</strong> (Tue, 30 Jan 2018 11:33:59 GMT):<br/>
Is there any SPSP https service available in the testnet-of-tesnets ?
</p>

@michielbdejong  I just pushed a "big commit" to adapt the java code to https://github.com/hyperledger/quilt/pull/85. There is a "but". 
java Quilt implementation now estrictely follows the ASN spec at https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/blob/master/asn1/InterledgerProtocol.asn and in the InterledgerReject triggeredAt and forwardedBy have "dissapeared". 
¿Error in the RFC or has this data get dropped from the packet at some moment?

Base64.getUrlEncoder() -> Base64.getEncoder() and 
adding "test." prefix is all that needed to make the java connector "connect" with the testnet.

@adrianhopebailie : Just a reminder that the Hyperledger Quilt project update for the TSC is due for this Thursday's call: 
* https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/tsc/project-updates/quilt-2018-mar?do=edit
* https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/tsc/project-updates
* https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/tsc/project-update-schedule

Will you or one of the other maintainers be providing the update?
</p>
<p><strong>adrianhopebailie</strong> (Mon, 26 Mar 2018 19:58:59 GMT):<br/>
I'll sync with some of the other maintainers. I will be on vacation but can dial in if I need to. We'll get the necessary pages added to the wiki too

Great to chat this morning Amit. I'll discuss with the rest if the Interledger team too if there is something that would be useful to explore.
</p>
<p><strong>adrianhopebailie</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 15:44:39 GMT):<br/>
One topic that I know is a challenge today is the ability to share regulatory information about a payment  between the intermediaries
</p>
<p><strong>eramitg</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 15:46:59 GMT):<br/>
sir , please help me out and discuss me this topic in detail using zoom meeting so that i can contribute in depth 
</p>
<p><strong>adrianhopebailie</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 15:47:23 GMT):<br/>
Because if the way Interledger is designed, all of the data about the payment is encapsulated inside the ILP packet and often encrypted from the sender to the receiver
</p>
<p><strong>adrianhopebailie</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 15:47:51 GMT):<br/>
Any connector that is passing along the payment can't see that information
</p>
<p><strong>adrianhopebailie</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 15:48:17 GMT):<br/>
But in many instances regulators need to have access to some of that information
</p>
<p><strong>adrianhopebailie</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 15:48:36 GMT):<br/>
So it would be interesting to find a way that it could be shared partially
</p>
<p><strong>eramitg</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 15:57:37 GMT):<br/>
yes it's a good idea for research point of view , i will explore this topic. let me look into this in detail and then i will get back to you on this scenario.

Hey, @adrianhopebailie ...sorry about this. Looks like the Hyperledger Fabric maintainers forgot to leave the meeting and it overran for a total of 259 minutes.
</p>

I am working on finding a better solution for this.

Hi!  I am interested in exploring deploying quilt for a payment platform.  Can you direct me to any platforms that are currently using quilt for this purpose, to better understand it's potential?

Hi Sunshine, Quilt is still just a collection of basic libraries you need to deploy an Interledger connector
</p>
<p><strong>adrianhopebailie</strong> (Fri, 11 May 2018 08:24:25 GMT):<br/>
If you'd like to build a connecto you may want to look at the reference implementation at https://github.com/interledgerjs/ilp-connector
</p>
<p><strong>adrianhopebailie</strong> (Fri, 11 May 2018 08:24:44 GMT):<br/>
You can use the components from Quilt to build a connector in Java

hi all. I am new to working on marketing/PR for Hyperledger. We are writing a follow up Consensus blog for the HL site that focuses on interoperability. Can someone share a few sentences, maybe 2-3, on what concrete progress we have made or are we planning to make with #quilt on this front? Or feel free to point me to some urls, PPTs, etc. Thanks!

@adrianhopebailie : I noticed this blog post on STREAM (https://medium.com/interledger-blog/streaming-money-and-data-over-ilp-fabd76fc991e). I am wondering when/if Hyperledger Quilt will support this. And if that in some way helps with the story of interoperability across the different Hyperledger projects.

@adrianhopebailie Hi, I really interested contributing in Quilt. Right now I am looking into the open issues of Quilt on Git. On of the issue is Unit tests for ildcp-core #144, You also suggested to add BTP and ILDCP modules #138 which is also added, Now How can we test it or verify that is valid updates.
</p>
<p><strong>VinayChaudharyOfficial</strong> (Fri, 01 Jun 2018 05:35:27 GMT):<br/>
Also I am looking into the other issue "Update InterledgerAddress for ILPv4 #139"  which you assigned yourself, Could you please assigned me, Or assign any issue. Also please help me how to test quilt in the local environment, do you have any documentation.

Hi. Wanted to know whether I will be able to transfer tokens from hyperledger to ethereum using Quilt?
</p>
<p><strong>adrianhopebailie</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 13:52:37 GMT):<br/>
Yes. Interledger is a payment protocol and Quilt a is a project to develop alternative implementations
</p>
<p><strong>adrianhopebailie</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 13:53:24 GMT):<br/>
Interledger supports cross-network payments so if you have at least one Interledger connector that has a connection into both networks you can make payments between them
</p>
<p><strong>adrianhopebailie</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 13:53:42 GMT):<br/>
If you have multiple then you at least have some competition for rates

Hi guys, Quilt seems like it will be immensely useful. I'm wondering are there any projects I could look at that connect Fabric, Sawtooth and Iroha with Quilt. I'm looking at this a as part of my thesis on Hyperledger so any good sources of information and code would be very helpful. 
Thanks in advance :)

@adrianhopebailie Thanks for the Contribution Guide, I'll be looking into it.
</p>
<p><strong>adrianhopebailie</strong> (Fri, 13 Jul 2018 06:38:22 GMT):<br/>
@Antonio_M There aren't any that I am aware of. The model is that if someone wants to use Interledger protocol to connect an existing payment network (based on Fabric for example) they need to write and integration to Fabric that can settle payments on that ledger.
</p>
<p><strong>adrianhopebailie</strong> (Fri, 13 Jul 2018 06:38:57 GMT):<br/>
Currently there are integrations for XRP Ledger, Lightning and Ethereum in various stages of maturity
</p>
<p><strong>adrianhopebailie</strong> (Fri, 13 Jul 2018 06:43:13 GMT):<br/>
Those integrations are all written as implementations of the ledger plugin interface (https://interledger.org/rfcs/0024-ledger-plugin-interface-2/) today because the only implementation of the an ILP connector is the reference one: https://github.com/interledgerjs/ilp-connector 
</p>

@Antonio_M - Hi, you may like to see Mojaloop: http://mojaloop.io/ which is an impementation of Interledger Protocol and is an Open Source. We (https://glimmer.finance) are currently working on an integration which however will take quite some time. You may also like to see: https://interledger.org/tutorials/.

I talked about the quilt call in the Arch WG and our topics. When the meeting minutes are ready (I assume Silona or someone else will get this out); I will post a link in the Architecture Working Group Rocket Chat.

Hello Quilt team, looking for your guidance more on how to achieve interoperability using quilt and moreover know the status on its maturity to be applied on any enterprise projects involving hyperledger fabric or ethereum. Earnestly looking for your help on that. Thank you.

@Silona Many of the projects seem to be focused on server side backend interoperability. Agoric has teamed up with Cosmos to improve the interchain protocol. I hazard a guess they will use web client interoperability. This may be worth TSC inclusion. https://www.cryptoninjas.net/2019/06/26/agoric-links-with-cosmos-devs-to-deliver-new-interchain-protocol/

@rjones I invited the Hyperledger Slack Bridge Bot into slack, but don't see anything happening....

<p><strong>sappenin</strong> (Fri, 25 Oct 2019 23:38:06 GMT):<br/>
Is there anything else we need to do?
</p>
<p><strong>sappenin</strong> (Fri, 25 Oct 2019 23:38:26 GMT):<br/>
I'm not totally clear - it says the RocketChat server needs to be restarted...assuming you already did that?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sat, 26 Oct 2019 01:28:25 GMT):<br/>
I didn't know I needed to do that - I can schedule a restart for next week?
</p>
<p><strong>sappenin</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 15:06:19 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, sounds great!
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 17:58:46 GMT):<br/>
@sappenin I think it's working without a restart - I got a DM from you
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 19:59:04 GMT):<br/>
how is it going?
</p>
<p><strong>sappenin</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 22:09:38 GMT):<br/>
@rjones can you clarify more? Are the ILP slack messages coming to you directly?
</p>
<p><strong>sappenin</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 22:10:10 GMT):<br/>
For example, I just sent a message in ILP slack that said, `testing @Hyperledger Slack Bridge Bot` but don't see anything in this `quilt` channel.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 22:11:29 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 22:11:42 GMT):<br/>
@sappenin I saw this as a DM
</p>
<p><strong>sappenin</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 22:12:46 GMT):<br/>
kk, just sent another message with ` @Hyperledger Slack Bridge Bot` as the first part of the message....did you see another DM?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 22:13:13 GMT):<br/>
I did not. I'll schedule a restart with IT
</p>
<p><strong>sappenin</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 22:13:20 GMT):<br/>
That "hello" message was sent on Oct 25th from slack...but curious that it went to you directly as opposed to this channel.
</p>
<p><strong>sappenin</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 22:13:44 GMT):<br/>
@hyperledger-bridge this is an outgoing test message.
</p>
<p><strong>sappenin</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 22:14:14 GMT):<br/>
hmmm...that message immediately above doesn't show up in ILP slack. Is that the right target?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 22:17:32 GMT):<br/>
I honestly don't know
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 22:17:47 GMT):<br/>
I figured it would just be mirroring these things
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 22:18:46 GMT):<br/>
what about now?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 22:19:01 GMT):<br/>
I set it to explicitly bridge this channel

@rjones @Silona I just sent an email re: DCO checks. Wondering what your thoughts are....
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 28 Oct 2019 22:28:11 GMT):<br/>
I'll restart the server at some point. I'm actually not here today and should not be doing things like editing server settings :)
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Tue, 29 Oct 2019 19:01:36 GMT):<br/>
So Ry they only have 3 real DCO's that are missing and they know who the authors are David and Adrian is there something easier than a squash commit.  Maybe just a note on those 3 or the code base itself?
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Tue, 29 Oct 2019 19:01:55 GMT):<br/>
I am assuming those came in via the webinterface before GH fixed it
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 29 Oct 2019 20:32:31 GMT):<br/>
@Silona GitHub has fixed nothing in that regard. In the past we've proposed having people sign a commit on the end - "I <so and so> attest that commits <hash list> are signed by DCO" and merging it. The reason we couldn't do that for Iroha was they couldn't find some of the committers. We (LF) should take it up with our lawyers to find a standard response.
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Tue, 29 Oct 2019 23:02:01 GMT):<br/>
I think just doing the signed commit should be fine.  It is the two primaries here Adrian and David
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 29 Oct 2019 23:04:17 GMT):<br/>
Sure. I sent email to legal to get advice on this, since it's an evergreen topic
</p>
<p><strong>sappenin</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 03:16:09 GMT):<br/>
signed commit sounds fine - LMK once you hear back from legal?
</p>
<p><strong>sappenin</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:47:25 GMT):<br/>
@Silona are there still blockers at the community level for the 1.0 release announcement? If so, can you send them my way to I can work on them ASAP?
</p>
<p><strong>sappenin</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:47:47 GMT):<br/>
(aside from the DCO thing)
</p>
<p><strong>sappenin</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:48:03 GMT):<br/>
BTW - I'm going to make a commit to disclaim my commits, and I'll prod Adrian to do the same.
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:48:10 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:48:16 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:48:54 GMT):<br/>
@sappenin We did hear back from legal, specifically list the commit hashes and sign off.
</p>
<p><strong>sappenin</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 15:49:23 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>sappenin</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 16:35:20 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>sappenin</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 22:54:55 GMT):<br/>
What are they looking for to call it "Active"?

Code commits, or discussion here, maybe?

</p>
<p><strong>sappenin</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 22:57:46 GMT):<br/>
I was sorting of thinking Quilt would operate similarly to Guava -- they're on version 28 now...but they increment major version fairly frequently: https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.google.guava%20AND%20a:guava&core=gav
</p>
<p><strong>sappenin</strong> (Wed, 30 Oct 2019 22:58:13 GMT):<br/>
I'm now seeing that's perhaps an incorrect view of the versioning world inside of Hyperledger....

The Linux Foundation’s CommunityBridge engineers are working on a tool to measure the health of critical open source projects and one of the key areas identified is QA Testing.  They request that our communities provide  honest and detailed information on testing tools and methodologies you use in your projects for us to come up with a detailed analysis, which they will share with all respondents and projects. https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/9H5G2GV. It’s only 5 questions long.

@sappenin I installed Sentry.IO for Quilt per request, but it looks like there is some rigging you need to do to hook it up.
</p>
<p><strong>sappenin</strong> (Tue, 17 Mar 2020 17:17:33 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, I'll take a look in a moment.
</p>
<p><strong>sappenin</strong> (Tue, 17 Mar 2020 17:23:03 GMT):<br/>
hmmm...looks like it's installed but sentry won't let me update permissions unless I'm an org owner....so, looks like this isn't going to work.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 17 Mar 2020 17:39:27 GMT):<br/>
which permissions need changed?

Hi All,
</p>
<p><strong>ShrutiHK</strong> (Tue, 14 Apr 2020 05:12:59 GMT):<br/>
I am interested in finding out more about Quilt and how mature the platform is. Is it possible for me to explore it by running a demo with any of the hyperledger blockchain platforms like fabric?
</p>
<p><strong>sudomann</strong> (Tue, 14 Apr 2020 06:51:50 GMT):<br/>
I'd be interested in that ^ as well. Can anyone chime in here?

@ashlinSajan If You want code You can took a look into quilt-iroha integration:
https://github.com/georgeroman/ilp-iroha-settlement/tree/master/examples/scripts/iroha-iroha-payment
look to docker commands which calls quilt.
</p>
<p><strong>baziorek</strong> (Tue, 09 Mar 2021 09:52:02 GMT):<br/>
I'm not specialist of quilt, I've just investigating iroha's part:)

There is still a Quilt call on the Hyperledger calendar (going on right now?).   Is the group still active in any of the usual Hyperledger forums {calls, email list, chat} or should I look elsewhere for current news?

There is still a Quilt call on the Hyperledger calendar (going on right now?) but as far as I can tell no one is there.  Is the group still active in any of the usual Hyperledger forums {calls, email list, chat} or should I look elsewhere for current news?

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 16:36:14 GMT):<br/>
@nage that project is dormant. https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/quilt/Hyperledger+Quilt
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 16:40:31 GMT):<br/>
I've removed the calls from the calendar
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 08 Dec 2021 16:40:53 GMT):<br/>
That is my understanding as well, but we were still looking for any options on the potential chat tool migration.   If anyone from Quilt sees this message and has a preference on chat tools, feel free to make it known to myself or Ry.   (Thanks Ry for updating the calendar.)
