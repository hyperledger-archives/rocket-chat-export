{"msg":"@jsmitchell @boydjohnson @cianx @drozd @pschwarz I made a couple of potential fixes to the the chain controller code (in `ChainController.on_block_validated`).\n\nThe first problem I found was that, because target and initial wait times are small, blocks are coming quickly and I found that validators would get into this state where they kept running the same block through validation.  The reason was that each time it had made a decision about the block, it would find that the chain head was updated while that was happening.  So, I changed the code so that that if a block validates successfully, but the chain head changed while it was being validated, and one or more descendant blocks arrived while the block was being validated, instead of rescheduling that block it schedules the descendants.  If not, then it simply reschedules the block.  There is still a potential problem with that I haven't bothered working out yet.\n\nThe second problem I found was that if a validator checks a block, decides it likes the current chain head better, and it doesn't detect that the chain head changed while it was processing it, if a descendant had arrived while that block was being processed it will stay in the pending blocks map and it, and all of its descendants, will never be checked (because each descendant block checks to see if its ancestor is in the pending blocks map and if so, it assumes that it will eventually be processed).  Essentially, the original block and all descendants are on a fork that that validator will never bother checking.  The fix was that if a block is valid, but is not to become the chain head, if it has immediate descendants in the pending blocks map, then the descendants are validated.\n\nHere is my branch with the proposed fixes (as well as copious amounts of logging messages):\n\nhttps://github.com/jjason/sawtooth-core/tree/DebugForkResolution\n\nIf you search for `JLJ` you'll find the two places I updated in the code.\n\nI am still tracking down one problem I am seeing.

{"msg":"Sawtooth client submits transaction batch to the validator through the corresponding REST-API\nPoET Consensus takes the submitted batch of transactions and builds a candidate block. Once candidate blocks are completed, they are delivered to the Chain Controller for validation and fork resolution.\nEach validator within the network requests a wait time from an enclave, or a trusted function. This is where the 'Elapsed Time' comes into play. \n\nThe validator with the shortest wait time for a specific block is appointed the leader, and creates the block to be committed to the ledger.\n\nThe transaction validator with the shortest wait time publishes the transaction block. \n\nThe transaction block is then broadcast to the publishing nodes.\n\nEach node within the network receives the transaction block, and validators verify whether the transaction is valid or not.

In terms of the EVM, the state storage is stored on all nodes right (any thoughts on IPFS or a content addressable distributed storage medium to store the contracts and just store the balances on chain?).. to run the contracts only 1 node needs to run instead of all validators? That one enclave would submit the evm contract tx after running it through the TEE and the submitter would verify it is the correct state before letting the enclave submit, that is how I kinda imagine it would work efficiently.

The interface is basically just a `start()` method that receives a couple objects used to communicate with it. When the driver is started, it creates a background thread that handles communications with the validator and then calls the engine's start method from whatever thread called `driver.start()`, which is the main thread in both the PoET engine and Raft engine. It is expected that the engine will sit in a loop and process updates from the validator (which is receives on a queue or channel) and make requests to the validator (using a service object provided by the driver). Any data used by the engine is private to the engine and it is up to the engine implementer to decide what kind of threading model to use.

{"msg":"@amolk Thanks for your question! In our implementation of USIG, a key pair is generated and sealed when a USIG enclave instance is initialized the first time. That key pair is used afterwards. However, every USIG enclave generates an ephemeral random value, epoch, that is unique for each enclave instance. This value, as well as the counter value, is never sealed. We use the epoch value to detect an attempt of rollback attack.","username":"sergefdrv","ts":"2018-07-13T16:21:29.119Z"}

The rules for validness include no double spending, valid signatures, no introduction of more currency than allowed, ... These are the network rules, and every full Bitcoin node verifies them.\n\nThe active chain is one path from genesis block at the top to some leaf node at the bottom of the block tree. Every such path is a valid choice, but nodes are expected to pick the one with the most \"work\" in it they know about (where work is loosely defined as the sum of the difficulties). Relativity and technological constraints prevent us from doing instant communication across the globe, so two nodes can not be expected to pick the same chain as the active one. This is no problem: the mining mechanism makes sure that the chance two nodes disagree about blocks in the past decreases exponentially as they are older.\n\nSo no, there is not one \"right chain\", there are many. Nodes choose for themselves, but the system is designed to make sure consensus arises quickly.\n\nThe rules in practice are this: when a new block arrives, and it extends the previous active chain, we just append it to the active chain. If not, it depends on whether the branch it extends now has more work than the currently active branch. If not, we store the block and stop.

I'm worried that some of the block difficulty attacks on the bitcoin backbone can get amplified big time here, since we are estimating population based on the randomness sampled, and the z-test documentation that I found doesn't address the randomness itself, other than the block wins.  Intuitively, if I'm sampling a 256-bit number, and I sample, say, 1, then the z-test should toss this.  Otherwise the impact on the population estimate may be huge, particularly if I have enough compromised enclaves to cover the population estimator's window.

{"msg":"Apologies in advance for the long post.. calling @Dan, @MicBowman, @hartm, @jsmitchell, @amundson for your input on the following consensus problem.\n\nI am researching if and how consensus algorithms solve the \"fair ordering\" problem. In general, fair ordering means that a Byzantine node can not order transactions in a way that unfairly benefits that node. This problem is not interesting in lottery-type algorithms, because the probability of a single node winning and being able to take advantage of unfair ordering is small enough that it is ignored.\n\nThis problem is important in voting-type algorithms with a long-term leader, such as many PBFT variants. A malicious leader can, in some cases, participate in a protocol perfectly but manipulate the ordering to its benefit by:\n\n1. Manipulating the order of a given set of transaction to its benefit\n2. Generating and inserting new transactions into the ordering to its benefit\n3. Withholding submitted transactions from the ordering to its benefit\n\nOne thing that makes this problem hard is that, without application-specific knowledge from the transactions, it is difficult to tell if an ordering actually benefits the leader or if \"random noise\" caused the ordering to be substantially different than the expected ordering.\n\nI have been able to come up with two partial solutions to this problem within the context of solving it for sawtooth-pbft. The first is to have followers compute a heuristic or \"probability that the ordering is fair\" and to start a new election if they determine the leader appears to be manipulating the order. The second is inspired by the original PBFT paper by Castro and Liskov and applies to the ordering of batches within blocks.\n\nI have described one example of a heuristic that prevents excluding batches indefinitely here: https://gist.github.com/aludvik/164a9c0a7419b758e54190c4a0dfa72b This solution is somewhat inspired by the PoET z-test.\n\nFor the second solution, the relevant portion of the PBFT paper is section 4.6 on non-determinism. (Paper found here: http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/osdi99.pdf) If we treat the batch ordering as non-deterministic (because of network latency, dictionary iteration order, etc.), then we can use some application of what is described in 4.6. An example would be to have all followers vote on the batch ordering for the next block before it is published and to require that the leader decide which batches to include by some deterministic computation over 2f+1 of the votes. This creates a smaller new problem to deal with, which is that malicious followers can vote for bogus batch ids, but I think a clever computation should be able to resolve it.\n\nHas anyone else out there considered this problem in any detail? Does anyone have any thoughts or feedback on the two solutions I proposed, or have any ideas for extending them that would improve how they handle the problem?","username":"adamludvik","ts":"2018-10-10T00:56:07.226Z"}

This could be useful for updating the engine's configuration based on on-chain settings (like the peers list, block period, and election/heartbeat tick settings used by Raft); the engine could just pass a list of settings to the validator when it registers, then each time a block is committed, the validator can check those settings and notify the engine of any changes.

{"msg":"@amundson it is not \"exactly the same problem\". While TPs and consensus engines are similar, the major difference is that TPs are passive and only respond to requests from the validator whereas engines are active and send requests to the validator. So while a TP can sit idle indefinitely with little harm, once started a consensus engine is going to react to internal state and events and try to interact with the validator. What we don't want is an engine to connect and think it is the \"active\" engine, but have everything it tries to do be rejected by the validator so that it gets into some weird state or crashes.\n\nYou bring up a valid point about polling being a bad model, which I don't think is hard to resolve. We can define the states as {Connected, Registered, Active} instead of {Connected, Registered} and allow engines to connect and register their name/version with the validator. The validator can then sends \"you are now active\" and \"you are now inactive\" messages to the registered engines when the setting changes to let them know when they should start monitoring internal state and events.","username":"adamludvik","ts":"2018-10-24T17:49:03.694Z"}

{"msg":"@amundson @jsmitchell would like to get your thoughts on one particular issue with Raft - not sure if you've encountered it with PBFT. In Raft, a follower node will forward transactions to the leader, who will execute them. The transactions will be validated, assembled in a block that will be sent to the followers. The followers will now start validating transactions, pulling them from their queue. \nIn case the leader encounters an error while validating a transaction, that transaction is discarded and never appears in a block. These transactions will remain in the follower nodes' queues with pending status. The only time these transactions will be cleared from the queue is in case a follower becomes a leader.\nIn the past, we've discussed possible ways to clear the queue by periodically trying the validate transactions on the followers so they discard invalid transactions from the queue.\nHowever, while validating these pending transactions, the state on the followers may be different from the state on the leader when it rejected the transactions. Transactions rejected by the validator my succeed on the follower. Therefore, for consensus mechanisms that have a semi-permanent leader, it would be ideal to have a mechanism to convey the status of invalid transactions to followers.  The block is essentially a list of successful transactions, perhaps we need a similar mechanism to list and propagate rejected transactions from the leader.\nThoughts?","username":"amolk","ts":"2019-03-25T15:21:55.659Z"}

{"msg":"Hi all,\nI’m conducting some performance and scalability research with PoET and was hoping this community could help clarify some of the detailed workings for me.  More specifically, I have been using Hyperledger Caliper to deliver workloads to small Sawtooth simulated networks of 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16 nodes spun up with Docker containers.  Some of my experimental results report a transaction throughput of 0 tps despite a non-zero delivery rate and an experimental duration of at least a minute.  This has led me to question my choice of various network parameters, and to wonder about what is happening in a more detailed way with PoET that I perhaps don’t understand.  My strange throughput results happened with a choice of (target_wait_time=5, initial_wait_time=25) AND (target_wait_time=5, initial_wait_time=5). Here are some specific questions I have, and it would be SO RAD if I could get some of your brain power. (I know the code itself can be read, but I really need some human help) :\n\n1. In PoET, peers sample an exponentially distributed random variable to achieve a wait time. Take, for example, a target_wait_time of 5 seconds.  If I wanted to choose wait times from an exp distribution that averaged ~5s, I would sample from a distribution where lambda=1/5, because the mean of an exp distribution is 1/lambda, and 1/(1/5) = 5, my desired average.  Is that what is happening in PoET, or are there nuances to the form of the exponential distribution used for sampling?  Additionally, how does the estimated population_size affect the sampling distribution?  In a network of size X, does lambda decrease by exactly a factor of X?  I want to know this for mental reasoning about the likelihood of anomalous block intervals using CDFs and such.\n2. When creating a PoET network, one can specify the target_wait_time and the initial_wait_time.  I understand that the initial_wait_time is used to help determine the localMean before the network size can be adequately determined (not enough data).  In theory this is something that the administrator of the network can choose based on his/her knowledge of the size of the initial network?  What are potential issues that could arise if an inappropriate value of initial_wait_time was chosen for the network?  Too many collisions?  Too much time between blocks being published?\n3. initial_wait_time factors into the localMean calculation until sampleLength (<—referring to the PoETdocumentation) blocks have been published on the chain.  In the code this variable is called population_estimate_sample_size or something?  And I know it defaults to 50.  Where does that number 50 come from and can it be changed by a network administrator without altering source code?\n4. At a higher, mechanistic/conceptual level, how does PoET determine an estimate of the network size from block publishing data?\n5. When a node is experiencing backpressure (?.. a full queue) does anything about its performance change? Does it engage in any other behavior?  I ask because I expect to deliver workloads that are too fast for the network to handle, and my assumption is that the validator simply keeps processing transactions from the queue and if the queue is full, simply drops anything incoming.\n\nI should stop here, but finally - does anyone have suggestions for parameter values I should choose to have a well-functioning network? Starting with small 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 - node networks (I know PoET shouldn’t be used in production with less than about 10 nodes, but this is performance experimental).  Parameters:\ntarget_wait_time\ninitial_wait_time\nbatches_per_block (my workload currently delivers intkey transactions at 20 txns/batch)\nmin/max peer connectivity\nand any other settings that might relevant but I’m not using?\n\nMaybe it’s just the case that I need a much longer warmup or “bootstrapping” phase before measuring experimental data.\n\nThank you so much!

{"msg":"Sounds like an interesting project. The ramp behavior is different than the 'warm' behavior. The initial design of poet assumed that nodes would gradually be added to a network over the ramp time. Typically when most people launch test networks, all nodes are launched simultaneously, which makes the assumptions in the ramp inaccurate. Having the ramp in this case is harmless, but it's likely to throw your numbers off. In particular I think the default is 50 blocks for the ramp which is coincidentally is about the same duration that you are measuring. So I think you are only measuring the ramp.\nI would recommend letting the network stabilize for at least 50 blocks if not 100, and then starting your measurements at that point.\n\nSecond thing would be understanding more what you are trying to measure and what comparative numbers exist. This is a good paper: https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi16/nsdi16-paper-eyal.pdf\nI don't think it explicitly measures stale block rate, but I think there is something in there about 'mining efficiency' which sounds like a similar if not the same concept.\nI don't remember how it measures this, but I would be curious how one considers a stale block validated on just the host that created it vs. one that gets propagated needlessly across the whole network. I wouldn't be surprised if poet has inefficient propagation, but that would be good to identify and consider how to improve without breaking the protocol.","username":"Dan","ts":"2019-05-19T16:43:00.554Z"}

{"msg":"Thanks for these thoughts!  I actually have not analyzed whether an orphan is validated on all or just some nodes - that's a great idea and I'll comb the logs again differently to get that sense.  I'm also planning to start experimenting with cutting the first 1000 seconds and will let you know what I see.  @jsmitchell I did notice that you see a \"fork comparison is between - and xxxxxx\" when there is no conflicting candidate and am accounting for this as well.  I have one other theory regarding the extreme stale block rates - I'm performing these experiments on such a resource-constrained system that memory itself may be a communication bottleneck that is creating such a high effective block propagation latency that nodes are busy creating many of their own blocks before they get around to processing an incoming block... it still seems a little extreme, but perhaps.  The plan this summer is to move the experiments onto a cluster and really start digging deeper.  I've attached two graphs that may be interesting.  These are all for the first 1000 seconds of time, with workloads delivered from Caliper.  One graph examines varying the block interval from 3 to 100 seconds.  The other uses a fixed block interval of 20 sec.  The only other thing that I'm having trouble explaining on these graphs is that the stale block rate (at relatively shorter block intervals at least) is higher at a delivery rate of 5 tps than it is at 10 tps.... quite consistently.  I can't explain why a change in the rate of incoming transactions (especially such a small, mild change) should affect the stale block rate at all.  (Each data point in these graphs was achieved by running an experiment for about 1000 seconds at a fixed-rate workload at the specified incoming TPS for several runs, and then averaging these runs.  Error bars can be large as I believe n=4 for most of these.)  If you have any thoughts on that, I would also be curious.","username":"amiec","ts":"2019-05-22T14:18:44.667Z"}

Using the max approach ensures that no more than f nodes can be faulty or out-of-sync at the cost of some flexibility; using the mod approach would be the opposite. It's strictness vs. flexibility. IMO, flexibility (and therefore better liveness) is more desirable; I wouldn't like to see the network held back from committing a block when it's still able to do so safely. I also don't know that I agree that this is unusual for PBFT since it's the intended behavior of the algorithm.

{"msg":"@ltseeley @kodonnel  We looked a little closer into the logs, and the offending portions seems to be when block 6 came in before block 5 (or even block 4!) during the catchup and it got discarded. Subsequently all blocks after 6 also get discarded since the previous block does not exist with the pbft engine. However somewhere when it receives block 5 it adds it to its log. It is able to catchup upto block 4 using the seals in the next block 9upto 5). But when it is processing catchup on block 5 it does not have 6, so it sends out a seal request. It doesnt receive a response (rightly so) since the rest of the network is at block 1406 or something. So it stalls now at block 5.  about 60% of our runs result in this scenario where it gets stuck on various blocks (depending on which block number was received out of sequence).

The process of catchup begins with the late validator being notified of the new chain_head, then working its way backwards from that point to the last block it shares with the rest of the chain.  At this point ( presuming validator 1.2, 1.1 is slightly different) the engine receives a BlockNew message, and the engine requests validation. Then the validator proceeds to validate the block ( i.e. passes the TP's etc and produces the expected result) only then is a BlockValid message passed to the pbft-engine, at which point, the block's seal can be obtained and checked versus the grandparent blocks voting membership.

{"msg":"Hi @kodonnel love the reference to mud :-) but couple of observations since we dug into both the entire set of logs and the code. all the logs are PBFT logs, so no confusions with the Validator logs. What is happening here is that we are trying to catchup a new node that has no prior blocks. Line 58 in the PBFT logs is confusing since it says internal error for the genesis block (since the block number is 0, but the seq num for PBFT is 1). But it already had previously got it in the start state in line 32, and processed it in line 39.  In line 60 the PBFT engine gets block number 1 from the validator. It then gets block 2 in line 70 and marks block 1 valid in line 83/84 and commits in line 120.  Meanwhile it has continued to receive blocks and put them in the log marked as unvalidated (pending processing I guess). At line 130 you can see it receives block 6, but it hasnt yet received block 4 or block 5 - so it throws an error and discards that block. In line 139 it gets block 4 and then line 149 block 5. Subsequently as block 7 on wards come in but are discarded since it doesnt have block 6/discarded it previously.  Meanwhile it continues processing and commits upto block 4 (line 253). But on block 5 it doesnt have block 6 for the seal and makes a Seal Request (which will be ignored by the rest of the network) line 167. Subsequent to that it pretty much stalls in the catchup since it has no more blocks to process....  I am guessing if a new batch is sent and a new block request came in, then the validator would try to again find previous blocks but it has a lot of catching up to do and might stall again (we had a scenario a couple of monhts back when a node mysteriously caught up after a few days, but I think it looks like it might have incrementally caught up/ stalled each time a new block was processed )","username":"RajaramKannan","ts":"2020-04-17T04:31:46.454Z"}

Since it discards that block as it does not have its predecessor at that point, it ends up stalling when it processes the predecessor of that block.   @ParitoshPandey is the lead engineer on our end who took this initiative up.

{"msg":"@RajaramKannan transactions are run when a block gets validated. Blocks get validated when the consensus engine tells the validator to check the block with a \"check blocks\" command. The PBFT consensus engine tells the validator to check a block when it gets a \"new block\" notification from the validator. This notification can come at any time, whenever the validator receives a new block from another node. Technically, this can happen at any phase; the consensus engine will check any block that could be valid, even if it's not ready to commit that block. When the network is in-sync, a secondary node will generally receive and check a block while it's in the \"pre-prepare\" phase, before the primary sends out the \"Pre-prepare\" message. But if a node is out-of-sync with the network, it may receive a block while it's in a different phase; in this case, it would still validate the block (transactions are executed), but won't decide to commit the block until it's ready.","username":"ltseeley","ts":"2020-11-11T15:32:45.337Z"}

(unless the \"pre-prepare\" message is separate from the receipt of the block from the primary?).   Just as a background to these questions, we have been live for a few months as a Regulated fractional bond trading exchange (https://bondevalue.com/news/bondevalue-gets-mas-approval-to-operate-the-bondblox-bond-exchange/) .

{"msg":"@RajaramKannan you got it, the \"pre-prepare\" message is separate from receiving the block. Blocks are broadcast automatically by the validator. Consensus doesn't control how blocks are shared on the network. The PBFT consensus engine on the primary node will tell its validator to finalize a block, then the validator will broadcast that block to all other nodes, then the engine will broadcast the \"pre-prepare\" message to all the secondaries. On the secondary nodes, the validators will receive that block and notify the engines regardless of what phase those engines are in.","username":"ltseeley","ts":"2020-11-12T15:12:59.676Z"}

{"msg":"sorry couple was a misdirection, it might be 3 :-). 1. I know the TP is run on a transaction multiple times, for example to check for non-determinism. Are those multiple executions as soon as a Validator receives a transaction or is that executed only by the validator that is currently preparing a block? 2. Is the transaction again executed in PBFT in the commit phase (secondaries) or only during the preprepare as discussed above? 3. When a view change happens and the leader changes, if the previous leader had a block already proposed, will the new leader create a new block (and the order of batches in that new block possibly changed from what the previous leader might have ordered?)

{"msg":"@lucgerrits for disk, it is usually IOPS that matter more than throughput. for CPU, it doesn't matter how many cores you have, it matters if the core(s) it is using are at 100%. the batches per block only matter up to a point--keep in mind that it is a max, and if you set it really high then the actual batches per block will be determined by disk and cpu, with a little bit of inefficiency since the process will be resource starved. iirc, you can use \"sawtooth block list\" to see the actual batches per block.","username":"amundson","ts":"2021-05-03T13:47:02.136Z"}
