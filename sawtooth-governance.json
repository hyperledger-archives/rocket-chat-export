PoET2 is being developed in rust and we probably don't want to bring any baggage (e.g. defaults) over into the new code.\nOn deprecating PoET1 and some rationale for naming PoET2, I think that poet naming is confusing at this point (sim/sgx v cft/bft) if we further layer another poet version on top of that then we end up with a matrix and that's far far too confusing for users.\nIncidentally in PoET2 the approach to cft/enclave-simulation will be a compiler flag rather than a separate code path.","username":"Dan","ts":"2018-07-17T15:32:50.213Z"}

{"msg":"Argument for Jira: it's often hard to know what component is the root of an issue. If a bug is filed as a github rather than jira issue that may create an obstacle to routing it to the real root cause. For release processes we might want to set stories that touch multiple components and examples.\nLine Wrap: Need to specify for what. We have different lint requirements for different languages. In the case of markdown I don't personally care about line wrap because they are often authored and displayed in tools that will auto-wrap.\nFile names: is that another language convention? Java file names match class names which are generally UpperCamelCase.\nLinting: should probably match across repos. this will facilitate static analysis for CII.\n\nRegarding maintainers, the threshold for adding maintainers should probably include something at least qualitative so that we don't have maintainers of some repo adding new maintainers in an inconsistent or indefensible manner. e.g. 2. any new maintainers need to be approved by all other maintainers and have shown a commensurate level of contribution in the commit history [or pull request reviews].\n\nThat last part might be controversial, but I expect that as repos get busier some people spend most of their time reviewing contributions.","username":"Dan","ts":"2018-09-12T19:19:54.955Z"}
