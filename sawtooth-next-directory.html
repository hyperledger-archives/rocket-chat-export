Hello @danintel - I found a fix for the issue and created pull request #21 to apply the fix to the repo. As you can see, you are receiving the warning `The ISOLATION_ID variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.`  It appears the the repo was missing the .env file. The .env file sets the environment variables for the project and because the file was missing, the ISOLATION_ID variable was not set and defaulted to a blank string. I have added the .env file in PR#21 and once the PR has merged with master, you should be able to successfully run `docker-compose up` command.

@mtn206. That works for me.  Thanks.  Here's a workaround until it's integrated, for the benefit of others:
```cd /path/to/sawtooth-next-directory

</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 22:56:16 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 18:52:46 GMT):<br/>
I am seeing lots of "Copyright 2017 *** Corp.." headers on files and wondering if these are simply generated by IDE, copied over from Sawtooth-core, or otherwise required for some reason. 
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 18:53:32 GMT):<br/>
I am going to skip on the copyright and licensing in every single file for the time being. 
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 20:26:17 GMT):<br/>
I've seen before where people have just copied files to get started and incorrectly kept the intel copyright header.
You can look at the git history for a particular file though and see who committed it. If it came from a t-mobile address for example, then the banner should be updated. 
The Linux Foundation gave guidance in the spring, that for new files you are welcome to use something like "Hyperledger Sawtooth project & maintainers" rather than specific companies. We asked for further clarification and I think we expect some update in the next few weeks.

All, starting today, Thur, 9/6/18, daily standup is via Skype: https://meet.t-mobile.com/agnes.goldingay1/TB9YZ36L dial in: 1-844-202-5500,,4191791129#

@AlyOwens13 have you requested access to the repo yet?: https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/teams/sawtooth-next-contributors/members ?

<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 16:48:29 GMT):<br/>
ok working on it

Can you see this: https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/teams ?
</p>
<p><strong>AlyOwens13</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 16:50:31 GMT):<br/>
yes

Option 1:

Team: "sawtooth-next-contributors" should have WRITE to sawtooth-next-directory
Repo: sawtooth-next-directory
Settings/Branches
- master
X Require pull request reviews before merging
X Restrict who can push to matching branches
Team: "sawtooth-next-committers" 

I think that accomplishes the intended security restrictions of locking down merge permissions to the repo to only a few people but giving the entire team access to Issues, Project and Wiki.
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 17:47:52 GMT):<br/>
Option 2:

Team: "sawtooth-next-contributors" should have READ to sawtooth-next-directory
Team: "sawtooth-next-committers" should have WRITE to sawtooth-next-directory
Repo: sawtooth-next-directory
Settings/Branches
- master
X Require pull request reviews before merging
X Restrict who can push to matching branches
Team: "sawtooth-next-committers" 

In this option, only "sawtooth-next-committers" members have ability to assign and review issues, edit Project and edit Wiki. That would make Project and Wiki un-usable (Wiki could be used still if you want to allow "public" write access).

All other Hyperledger projects use the Hyperledger JIRA instead of GitHub Issues/Projects/Wiki, so they have not had to consider the lack of granular permissions on GitHub for those features.

@kthblmfld I prefer to defer to @ChrisSpanton. He was going to directly talk to HL to settle the permissions/roles at large. more to come...

I now see edit buttons everywhere in the repo.. Wooho! 
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 22:03:47 GMT):<br/>
Yes - the group (sawtooth-next-contributors) should now be appropriately permissioned - anyone needing to have issues assigned, etc, will need to request access

Hi all. It looks like this merge broke the tests in the project: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-next-directory/pull/13
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 00:25:19 GMT):<br/>
I approved the changes so it's on me to fix
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 00:29:29 GMT):<br/>
There are a number of improvements we are spotting here and they are becoming too numerous for a single PR, so I will be creating issues for the changes that are simple changes but also changes that touch lots of files
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 00:30:03 GMT):<br/>
Also we are restoring the tests
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 01:18:43 GMT):<br/>
@ChrisSpanton when you get Admin permission on the repo we should set:
Settings/Branches
- master
X Require pull request reviews before merging

Or I can ask Tim to do so?

There shouldn't be any direct commits to the repo, only pull requests and approved merges of pull requests.
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 01:38:07 GMT):<br/>
Does anyone know best practice for rebasing and/or squashing these pull requests so we don't pollute the commit history?

Hello all.  I have just ran this project using `docker-compose up`.  Before that, I configured the config.py to include necessary keys.
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:21:51 GMT):<br/>
I can view the login page, signup page, reset password page.  However, those page do not progress
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:23:22 GMT):<br/>
Meaning when I click the login or signup up button, nothing happens
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:24:02 GMT):<br/>
Is there something I should do or configure to get this to work?
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:26:33 GMT):<br/>
Hello @LedgerXYZ. Anything in your console? 
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:27:03 GMT):<br/>
Try instead running *docker-compose up --build*
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:27:58 GMT):<br/>
Just a heads up: Development has just continued on this project and we are still stabilizing it
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:28:50 GMT):<br/>
We have test failures and instability due to a recent merge
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:29:42 GMT):<br/>
We are actively working on improving build process, test automation, stabilizing sources, improving documentation, adding new features
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:30:39 GMT):<br/>
It should be stabilized within a week
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:31:13 GMT):<br/>
I'm thoroughly impressed.  This project snuck up on me
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:31:26 GMT):<br/>
I will try the docker-compose up --build
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:31:32 GMT):<br/>
It did?
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:32:03 GMT):<br/>
Yes it did.  I have been actively working with sawtooth since Nov 2017
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:32:08 GMT):<br/>
Glad to hear you are impressed. In the next few weeks it should get much better
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:32:19 GMT):<br/>
Oh ok
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:33:09 GMT):<br/>
We have a number of new contributors and stakeholders on this project and are all collaborating on it 
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:33:31 GMT):<br/>
Ultimately, who owns this project
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:33:33 GMT):<br/>
We have an open daily standup at 11:30 PST
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:33:44 GMT):<br/>
is this being open sourced by T-MOBILE?
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:33:44 GMT):<br/>
Ha! Good question. 
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:36:25 GMT):<br/>
I defer to @ChrisSpanton and Nicholas Criss  (both T-Mobile) for direction and consider them the owners
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:36:52 GMT):<br/>
Ok I will try to get involved
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:36:56 GMT):<br/>
But there are contributors from Microsoft, Intel, Moonraft
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:37:02 GMT):<br/>
Great!
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:37:08 GMT):<br/>
with the community
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:37:18 GMT):<br/>
Wow, you have a strong backing on this
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:37:29 GMT):<br/>
This project couldn't have come at a better time
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:37:49 GMT):<br/>
Yea but we could definitely use more hands-on with a veteran contributor
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:37:54 GMT):<br/>
I think I pushed the supply-chain to its limit and this offers a lot of the control I need
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:38:23 GMT):<br/>
Yea we could definitely use any help you can give
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:38:38 GMT):<br/>
I will help however I can.  I am more than greatful for you and your teams intiative here
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:38:43 GMT):<br/>
I have to run now. Creat to meet you!
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 02:38:43 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 03:02:43 GMT):<br/>
I tried the suggestion that @kthblmfld offered: Use `docker-compose up --build`.  Still no luck
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:35:11 GMT):<br/>
@kthblmfld mud on my face too RE: 13. Thanks for digging into that
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:35:41 GMT):<br/>
@adamgering I'll make sure we get that set... thanks for the awareness.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:40:09 GMT):<br/>
@LedgerXYZ thanks for the interest - this is definitely a community owned project. It was envisioned to solve problems and improve IAM related processes at T-Mobile, but is being designed to solve the broader open use cases around this space
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:41:24 GMT):<br/>
I'd be happy to sync up and chat about it any time, or alternatively as @kthblmfld mentioned, we host a daily standup that is open to the community. You are more than welcome to come join in via that process, or by whichever means feel right to you 
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:41:28 GMT):<br/>
That's why I can't wait to see what's behind the pages
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:41:56 GMT):<br/>
ha! let me see if I can repro the issues you're seeing
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:42:24 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I will attend your stands up.  I used to be an SM before I crossed over to the dark side
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:43:14 GMT):<br/>
Oh thanks for trying to repro my error
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:43:17 GMT):<br/>
right on! Lots of work going forward now, checking out the issues / project board in GH should reveal some more about where we are today, and whats on the short-term agenda
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:43:56 GMT):<br/>
What's a good link to your stand up
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:44:36 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:44:50 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:48:13 GMT):<br/>
My pleasure @agoldingay 
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:48:39 GMT):<br/>
So really quick @agoldingay Who exactly owns this project
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:49:52 GMT):<br/>
Clearly T-Mobile is plays a major role.  Is T-Mobile developing this open sourced.  Hence the open collaboration?
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:51:12 GMT):<br/>
@LedgerXYZ yes. :)
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:51:43 GMT):<br/>
This project was my vision.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:52:22 GMT):<br/>
On the T-Mobile side, im the product owner and lead our blockchain efforts. Everything here however is open source first, as you see donated to Hyperledger
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:52:38 GMT):<br/>
No way!
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:52:51 GMT):<br/>
Chat, standup, issue tracking and project management are all open efforts.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:53:13 GMT):<br/>
We strive to have no "closed door" processes here, and allow the community to be actively engaged
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:53:59 GMT):<br/>
What led you to this
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:54:17 GMT):<br/>
I read the article from Nov about the need for a project like this
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:57:00 GMT):<br/>
The vision came out of work that I've done at T-Mobile building our cloud business over the last few years. I built the N-Scale IAM and RBAC self-service platform that supports our work. It's a relatively messy closed-source collection of API's, automations, UI's, etc. As I looked at how to improve those solutions in the future, it became clear to me that a Sawtooth blockchain could dramatically improve the governance posture and auditing confidence
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:58:07 GMT):<br/>
So, we worked with the Intel team to build the first version of this last year, and announced it at AWS re:Invent. We've been driving it towards a production ready version (at varying speeds) since
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 15:59:01 GMT):<br/>
Life is weird because it makes you work hard first, then it offers a simpler and more effective way
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 16:01:31 GMT):<br/>
I started with the blockchain last year with an identity management goal.  I hated Ethereum platform because I perceived it as incompatible with widespread devices today.  Then it became a marijuana blockchain to track marijuana from seed to sale after I found the Sawtooth-supply chain.
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 16:02:50 GMT):<br/>
All along the way, I found myself doing more architectural research than actual coding.  One of the reasons was how to authenticate and authorize users on a blockchain in a fluid manner
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 16:03:03 GMT):<br/>
Then 2 days ago, I stumble into NEXT!!!
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 16:03:26 GMT):<br/>
To say this was a miracle is truly an understatement.  Thank you all so much for doing this
</p>

Wow the presentation at the standup today was quite an appetizer
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:02:25 GMT):<br/>
In mean time can someone try to reproduce my error that I posted about earlier
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:03:05 GMT):<br/>
I've tried running this on both my local machine as well as the google cloud shell without success.  Thank you all
</p>
<p><strong>mtn206</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:27:24 GMT):<br/>
Hello @LedgerXYZ ! Can you provide us with a copy of the command line output after you run the `docker-compose up --build` command and you attempt to perform a login request? 
</p>
<p><strong>mtn206</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:28:44 GMT):<br/>
If you could run the command on your local machine first, that would be most helpful. 
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 17:41:08 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for following up on this @mtn206!

@mtn206 Thank you
From what I have learned so far, there is a conflict with my configuration: `localhost` and the URL that cloud shell serves the localhost with: `https://<INSERT_PORT#>-dot-4245417-dot-devshell.appspot.com/`
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 20:04:38 GMT):<br/>
However I don't see how this should affect it especially if a widely used service like `ngrok` works in similar use case
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 20:14:52 GMT):<br/>
I believe you want to rebase your feature branch and then squash commits into a single commit (if more than one) prior to submitting a pull request (PR).
See https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-android/wiki/Squash-All-Commits-Related-to-a-Single-Issue-into-a-Single-Commit
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 20:15:26 GMT):<br/>
And then the pull request itself, after two approvals, should be a Rebase & Commit, not a Merge Commit.
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Fri, 07 Sep 2018 20:15:38 GMT):<br/>
That should keep the commit history clean.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Sat, 08 Sep 2018 17:26:28 GMT):<br/>
this is generally what we use as a guide for Sawtooth commits - https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Sat, 08 Sep 2018 17:30:26 GMT):<br/>
splitting commits up properly is as common and important as squashing them. the goal isn't one commit per PR, but good well-formed commits. For repos where we have release branches, a good question to ask is "is this broken up in a way that can be easily cherry-picked later"
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 05:12:18 GMT):<br/>
@adamgering @amundson Thanks for sharing. Looks like I need to make the switch from the IDE to the CLI, start using imperative form messages limited to 72 chars with subject line, etc. Ok, starting down that path.

<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 05:39:22 GMT):<br/>
I looked into the licensing matter and found the LICENSE doc at the root is standard for Apache 2.0 and they recommend for each source file the "boilerplate" license found in the appendix. The copyright section with year and owner seems vague. Maybe there is a legal reason. I see in Kubernetes that owner is described as "The Kubernetes Authors".

if it helps I can throw it up as an issue on github? not sure if thats what you guys are using to track issues
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 19:17:21 GMT):<br/>
It is reported as #47: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-next-directory/issues
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 19:17:47 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 19:21:02 GMT):<br/>
@kelly_ This project is (as of the past few weeks) picking up momentum after some time on the shelf. We are still iterating on backlog and issues and have a Project board here: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-next-directory/projects/1
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 19:21:02 GMT):<br/>
the one other comment I would make, is that the UI hangs when this error happens
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 19:21:33 GMT):<br/>
Yep. There is another team demoing/reimplementing the UI in React
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 19:24:25 GMT):<br/>
@chimpuz, @jiettu are some POCs on that front
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 19:25:42 GMT):<br/>
In the meantime, we have some new changes going into the NG UI but mostly happy path feature demo
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 19:26:11 GMT):<br/>
We have yet to sort out when and how the cutover will take place
</p>
<p><strong>yunhangc</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 20:06:26 GMT):<br/>
@kelly_ proposal_exists_and_open method can be very deceiving 
</p>
<p><strong>yunhangc</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 20:06:54 GMT):<br/>
if the "get_state_entry" throws an error it does not throw the error but return 
</p>
<p><strong>yunhangc</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 20:07:01 GMT):<br/>
return False
</p>
<p><strong>yunhangc</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 20:07:20 GMT):<br/>
which will give you the error that the proposal does not exisit or not open
</p>
<p><strong>yunhangc</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 20:07:41 GMT):<br/>
the proposal could be just there and just open.

@ChrisSpanton has been working on getting admin rights to the repo. He is at the Seattle Blockchain Conference today though. Ideally he will receive the privileges to make these repo changes so the turnaround time will improve.

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 14:38:36 GMT):<br/>
@ChrisSpanton @kthblmfld @AlyOwens13 Next directory seems to be ignoring the community norms and going off on it's own direction (Travis instead of the Sawtooth Jenkins, github issues instead of HL JIRA, github wiki instead of sphinx-doc, ignoring established maintainer and github access conventions, etc.). Do you guys see next directory as related to Sawtooth or as a separate project? Should next directory move to labs or apply to be a separate top-level project?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 16:12:44 GMT):<br/>
I think some of this is tribal knowledge (preferred tooling etc.). Maybe we can discuss some at the tech forum. I don't think you will be there though @amundson ? 
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 16:13:59 GMT):<br/>
I would see issue tracking and CI could be specific to a certain subproject/application. for example we use Burrow as an application but that doesnt mean that we use their same documentation setup
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 16:14:53 GMT):<br/>
so to the extent that next-directory is just consuming sawtooth-core components to build an application, it seems like their project could follow their own conventions
</p>
<p><strong>agoldingay</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 16:40:28 GMT):<br/>
@amundson thank you for your feedback. I've let he team you've addressed in your 7:38am thread review your concerns.

@amundson we're taking a community-based approach to driving this project. We'd love for you to join the effort! We obviously have an open chat forum here where we're actively engaged, and hold a daily stand-up thats open to the community. After traditional stand-up I'm sure we can find time to discuss community issues
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:10:19 GMT):<br/>
@Dan unfortunately, no, I'll be traveling
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:13:13 GMT):<br/>
@ChrisSpanton if you feel I've not been involved enough with Sawtooth, please do tell
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:13:34 GMT):<br/>
@amundson, I think @ChrisSpanton was referring to next-directory
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:13:54 GMT):<br/>
when you say the team is 'ignoring' that comes off as if they did something knowing/malicious
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:14:14 GMT):<br/>
I think @ChrisSpanton was offering to discuss their approach with you
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:14:47 GMT):<br/>
as an open source project I think we should take a look at where there needs to be strong consistency among repos and where their may be room for choice
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:15:48 GMT):<br/>
@amundson @ kelly_ thats certainly accurate. I wouldn't presume to comment on your participation in Sawtooth.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:17:01 GMT):<br/>
Next Directory is a standalone application built on Sawtooth. Its concerning to think that anyone considering building on Sawtooth need follow the decisions that were made for that codebase... I'd love for you to participate in NEXT, but certainly feel a need to defend our projects ability to make choices that fit
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:17:20 GMT):<br/>
sawtooth benefits from consistency but also from accessibility and broad participation, so i think we need to strike a balance between those things
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:19:37 GMT):<br/>
@ChrisSpanton ok, so you agree it should be it's own project. then it should go to Labs or propose to be a HL project. if it's a component of Sawtooth (as implied by the name and repo), then I think we should all be using the same tooling and processes.
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:20:05 GMT):<br/>
@amundson I think that's a discussion worth having vs. a unilateral decision
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:25:40 GMT):<br/>
We do plan to use sphinx-doc, not Wiki, for permanent documentation.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:27:04 GMT):<br/>
@kelly_ that was a stated opinion, not a decision, obviously
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:28:05 GMT):<br/>
Hyperledger JIRA has been brought up. Who would be the person to create the JIRA project and setup permissions?
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:29:28 GMT):<br/>
Continuous Integration is in progress of being brought up, so whatever works best. I do want to get integration testing built into that.
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:32:02 GMT):<br/>
GitHub branch permissions/settings are used to maintain same effective maintainer + Pull Request contribution model.
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:32:53 GMT):<br/>
GitHub otherwise lacked granular permissions to the Wiki and Issues, which we found useful.
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:33:44 GMT):<br/>
Happy to incorporate all Hyperledger best practices and would love help and guidance in doing so.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:34:14 GMT):<br/>
@kelly_ @amundson The questions here for me are: Are there defined standards that have been documented and agreed on which are being ignored here, or are we breaking some unspoken rules by allowing the project team to utilize tools that work best for them? If the former, please do share, and we can make a decision on whether its appropriate to conform or move the project. If the latter, then as I suggested I'll definitely defend our project teams ability to make decisions that fit.
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:41:20 GMT):<br/>
agreed, I think there is certainly a way we are doing it now, but I'm not yet convinced that all repos need to use the same issues tracking, documentation, or CI system. I certainly think it's worth us having a discussion about the pros/cons of each and where it makes sense. I can see an argument for both directions. conformity/consistency helps people move among different projects under the sawtooth banner at the same time some repos have their own communities and from an accessibility perspective there could be an argument to not unnecessarily raise the barrier to entry for them.
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:41:43 GMT):<br/>
it probably also depends on how closely that repository is linked to sawtooth
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:43:09 GMT):<br/>
@ChrisSpanton of course, its not that boolean. The reason I asked about how you see the project, is that we should not bother having tooling debates if our starting point is that it's two separate projects with completely separate communities.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:45:24 GMT):<br/>
@kelly_ we don't have a project per-repo, we have one project (Sawtooth) with mulitple components that we have broken up into multiple repos for technical reasons. and a few apps (Supply Chain, Next Directory, ...) that are essentially examples currently.
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:46:56 GMT):<br/>
I understand that, but different repos have different communities
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:47:37 GMT):<br/>
different teams, not different communities, because there is a lot of overlap on those teams
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:48:52 GMT):<br/>
currently, if I contribute to any of the repos, the rules are all the same (implied or explicit). different maintainers, but I don't have to learn a new culture.
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:49:34 GMT):<br/>
yup I understand that
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:49:59 GMT):<br/>
I'm saying in the future there could be different communities
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:50:26 GMT):<br/>
you have projects like geth, and parity, and aleth (c++) under the ethereum community
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:50:33 GMT):<br/>
each of those is part of the ethereum community
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:50:47 GMT):<br/>
but probably use different tools as an example
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:50:58 GMT):<br/>
or what if someone wants to submit a new consensus engine
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:51:26 GMT):<br/>
should they have to use jira instead of github? I'm not convinced of that yet. not saying they don't i just haven't heard the pros/cons articulated
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:52:22 GMT):<br/>
I get you are saying 'you don't want to have to learn a new culture' that is also true for new contributors/repos perhaps
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:52:31 GMT):<br/>
anyway we should just be specific about what items are part of the culture
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:52:33 GMT):<br/>
@ChrisSpanton there is a governance structure - https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-rfcs/ - which we setup so @kelly_ and I can have good debates a lot :) 
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:54:29 GMT):<br/>
@kelly_ I think that's what HL is itself though, with different projects having different communities and structures and goals for each.
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:57:05 GMT):<br/>
well you made a comment about 'community' and 'teams'
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:57:27 GMT):<br/>
and people can be in the same community but on separate and overlapping or non-overlapping teams
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:57:33 GMT):<br/>
e.g. ethereum and geth vs parity
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:57:34 GMT):<br/>
Hi folks. Please bear with us. We are new to this project and ramping up on several fronts. 
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:58:04 GMT):<br/>
To be clear, I care more about unity within our project than about specific tools. We could have a discussion about transitioning to use github issues instead of JIRA, using Travis CI instead of Jenkins, etc. I also have no opinions about what non-Sawtooth projects use. So don't feel I'm a big JIRA or Jenkins advocate here.
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:58:30 GMT):<br/>
ethereum as a community is prescriptive about some things (e.g. the EVM spec) but not about others (e.g. issue tracking)
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:59:04 GMT):<br/>
my 2 cents anyway
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 17:59:48 GMT):<br/>
but @amundson probably means we should have some biweekly or something scheduled 'governance' calls to discuss these topics on a regular cadence
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:00:30 GMT):<br/>
there are probably some items that should be *must* do and some items that are *should* do
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:01:41 GMT):<br/>
a good starting point would probably be documenting today's conventions for the majority of sawtooth repos
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:04:20 GMT):<br/>
yeah... I think everyone is clear we use Jenkins and JIRA, so I'm not sure what you are asking for in terms of documentation, especially if you are advocating that not even being a strict rule.
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:04:56 GMT):<br/>
are those the only conventions @amundson 
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:05:00 GMT):<br/>
I suspect there are unspoken ones
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:05:01 GMT):<br/>
we could flush out the maintainers stuff more, but it is documented as new maintainers added by consensus vote of existing maintainers
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:05:42 GMT):<br/>
e.g. size of commits, linting, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:05:44 GMT):<br/>
the anti-wiki thing is by convention, I don't think that is documented anywhere
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:06:41 GMT):<br/>
just enforced by turning it off consistently
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:06:42 GMT):<br/>
naming convention could be another for builds/images, etc
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:07:01 GMT):<br/>
I agree with @dan that there is probably a lot of 'tribal knowledge'
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:08:02 GMT):<br/>
also I'm not suggesting that you document it. i'm just suggesting that as a team we should consider documenting the things that are conventions, and then determine which ones are must and which are should
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:09:39 GMT):<br/>
Whatever direction we move in is doable. Travis or Jenkins, Jira or Github. I am glad you are chipping in because we have been moving ahead while catching up. Any direction, advice, documentation is welcome and we will put it to action.
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:09:46 GMT):<br/>
lines wrapped at 80 chars is another that i don't think is documented
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:10:03 GMT):<br/>
@kthblmfld :thumbsup:
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:10:33 GMT):<br/>
@kelly_ it's a strict rule you have to wrap your markdown text :)
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:10:57 GMT):<br/>
:) also capitalization is not allowed in file names? that's another one I got dinged for that wasn't documented
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:11:04 GMT):<br/>
most of that stuff we try and document via linting rules so there isn't debate. so we can rely on our tooling.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:11:22 GMT):<br/>
yeah, but at least I let you know :)
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:12:27 GMT):<br/>
anyway, i think you get the point. I'll start a list in #sawtooth-governance and then we can at least let @kthblmfld know the conventions today. if there are areas that are difficult to change than we can have a conversation about what is must/should
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:13:49 GMT):<br/>
@amundson @kelly_ Deal. Please get us a list asap and we will start the conversations internally. Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:14:52 GMT):<br/>
Travis -> Jenkins. Github -> Jira
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:14:56 GMT):<br/>
@kelly_ a general rule that might help is "try and be consistent with sawtooth-core and other repos unless there is a reason to deviate". will cut down on what you have to try and write up. 
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:15:58 GMT):<br/>
@kthblmfld the one other @amundson mentioned is that we use sphinx for publishing documetation
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:16:03 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/tree/master/docs/source
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:16:17 GMT):<br/>
.rst files get published into this - https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/1.0.5/
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:16:28 GMT):<br/>
Ah yeas
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:16:28 GMT):<br/>
Oh yea
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:16:49 GMT):<br/>
Sphinx is on the roadmap 
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:17:09 GMT):<br/>
one of our uncompleted projects is figuring out how to publish all the component docs together in some good way. still recovering from our rapid repo splitting.
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:17:20 GMT):<br/>
I bet
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:17:45 GMT):<br/>
but it's pretty easy to publish using different URLs. for some core stuff, it's too separate.
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:17:59 GMT):<br/>
Deferring to @ChrisSpanton to ultimately sort out where this fits relative to Sawtooth
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:23:41 GMT):<br/>
Judging by the RFCs, NEXT looks to be a consumer of Sawtooth: A use case. I doubt we will be making any changes to Sawtooth Core or SDKs, etc
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:24:24 GMT):<br/>
for maintainer (write/merge permission), our current process has been: "1. before adding anyone new, generate a MAINTAINER.md file based on the commit history, excluding infrequent contributors; 2. any new maintainers need to be approved by all other maintainers; 3) github maintainers group for that repo should match the maintainers in the file"  Usually I go adjust those maintainer groups. I'd like to bring this repo back into compliance with this so it's not an exception. So I propose we figure out that maintainer list based on historical activity and then vote new folks in.
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:25:55 GMT):<br/>
Got it. Will add MAINTAINER.md
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:26:39 GMT):<br/>
I guess it's plural MAINTAINERS.md
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:26:42 GMT):<br/>
example - https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:27:14 GMT):<br/>
@amundson the 'general rule' of go try to figure out the existing undocumented conventions is a burden on new contributors and increases the likelihood that they won't be 'conforming'. so probably better to be specific where you can
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:29:45 GMT):<br/>
What's a good practice for work-in-progress documentation, wireframes, diagrams, etc? We want to drop docs into sphinx-doc, but not ephemeral stuff and don't want to slow down collaborative editing with pull requests.
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:38:43 GMT):<br/>
It would be great if we incorporate/contribute any findings to the Hyperledger ecosystem to simplify the process for future teams. 
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:40:43 GMT):<br/>
@kthblmfld I think for real time WIP documentation the closest collaborative tool we've used is google docs
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:43:22 GMT):<br/>
other than that it is the RFC process in sawtooth-rfcs
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:45:22 GMT):<br/>
it's currently a struggle, because we try not to put half-baked/unmaintained docs out for consumption, but that makes it harder to be inclusive in discussions. we tend to shoot things around chat a lot in addition to google docs.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:45:36 GMT):<br/>
the RFC process has been good for design docs
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:46:01 GMT):<br/>
there are a lot of supply chain RFCs which are essentially app RFCs
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:53:48 GMT):<br/>
Ok. I have some research to do on the RFC process.
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:55:31 GMT):<br/>
We have a lot of fluctuation happening internally in the project as well. I get the impression there is lots of evolution underway in the Hyperledger ecosystem. As such, we need to be flexible and adaptive.
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:59:03 GMT):<br/>
probably too heavy of a lift at this point, it's more important onces a project reaches a more 'mature' status with a number of participants invested in the project
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 18:59:10 GMT):<br/>
so that the community can provide discussion aroudn it
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 19:18:53 GMT):<br/>
Agreed
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 19:23:09 GMT):<br/>
I liked that GitHub Wiki supports reStructuredText, so it's easy to copy stuff into Sphinx-Doc. Using a separate repo for WIP docs and RFCs, with or without the Wiki, may be the way to go.
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 19:24:42 GMT):<br/>
I am interested in better understand how the build pipelines are set up. Most of what I see now is built around Fabric.

</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 19:29:45 GMT):<br/>
Yeah only fabric was using the LF resources for build until recently.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 19:30:26 GMT):<br/>
We had a gating issue in sawtooth core that our jenkins approach didn't use jenkins job builder. We recently updated for that and plan to move our build on to the LF build servers soon.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 19:32:27 GMT):<br/>
The Jenkins file in sawtooth core should be a start.
I don't have strong feeling about CI conformity. For me getting over to LF maintenance was motivated mostly by cost. No need for us to pay for extra hardware. Most of the administration still relies on the project but the LF does have some administrative support.
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 19:33:11 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 15:28:48 GMT):<br/>
@adamgering the term 'working group' might be confused with the higher level working groups at hyperledger. Maybe 'design'? (That said I can see that anything is going to be a long repo name). Regardless of that think about using branches for intermediate work on docs.

@adamgering before you request a repo, probably good to drop a note in #sawtooth-governance; not sure everyone is able to monitor all the channels. we could call a root team vote. thats what we do before accepting new components too (I am going to propose a vote to create a pbft repo later in the week, for example)

Github UI doesn't separate pull requests by branch. We could setup a docs only branch that allows for direct editing for the GitHub web UI and not use PRs for that branch. Any reason not to do that?

<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 16:15:33 GMT):<br/>
Hi @PhuocDo . I have a PR out to address that. In the meantime, you will need to rename server/config.py.example -> server/config.py
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 16:54:55 GMT):<br/>
@adamgering what's the use case for the docs-only branch? is that to use one branch like a wiki (essentially)?
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 16:58:37 GMT):<br/>
Yes, exactly. I don't see a good way of filtering pull requests, thus for building up documentation from scratch, direct edits on a docs branch instead of PRs will avoid polluting our PRs with documentation updates. Docs branch can be a superset of the documentation that will be copied over to the /docs folder in master for official release.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:10:42 GMT):<br/>
why not just build them up in master as part of the normal development flow?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:12:51 GMT):<br/>
one of the nice things we have (in most the repos anyway) is that the master docs tend to track master pretty well, so during release time, there isn't a lot of extra work to do (some, but it is usually relatively minor at that point). plus, when we publish docs, then we can have latest master / nightly URL which reflects content in master instead of a release branch/version.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:13:12 GMT):<br/>
for example, for core, our latest release is 1.0.5 - https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:13:55 GMT):<br/>
but we also have latest master nightly docs - https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:15:08 GMT):<br/>
this let us work on 1.1.x while keeping the release docs fixed at 1.0, which has worked fairly well
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:15:33 GMT):<br/>
and once we do the 1.1 release, we will still have 1.0 docs, 1.1 docs, and master (which is now 1.2.x)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:17:10 GMT):<br/>
we very much take a docs-as-code approach for this so we get the same PR review, commit history, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:21:42 GMT):<br/>
kind of related - we are working on updating the website (https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/) so that we can do non-docs publishing there too. (for example, maybe want to add some sabre or supply chain or next directory webpages there that aren't derived from the docs). this is also meant to help with our publishing of content that is really cross-component that doesn't really have a good home now.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:25:30 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @amundson for filling in the docs approach - seems rather sensible. @adamgering does this address your concerns? Raise any? The website would be valuable I'm sure to provide landing-page type content as well. Will stay tuned there.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:33:39 GMT):<br/>
re:website - basically we are doing these things 1) get existing content mostly in the repo - finishing this PR -
 https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-website/pull/3; 2) add some docker/docker-compose stuff so we can all spin up the website; 3) define a publishing/build mechanism for markdown using jekyll to make it easier to modify; 4) maybe some linting stuff; 5) longer term - try and merge docs from different repos in a better way, at least for "platform" components that run alongside core like PoET, Raft, PBFT, Sabre, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:34:07 GMT):<br/>
after (3), it should be pretty easy to add subpages to the site
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:35:20 GMT):<br/>
my biggest concern is after we do all those technical things, getting it looking flashy enough
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:35:44 GMT):<br/>
i.e. write really good templates for jekyll
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:36:38 GMT):<br/>
re: landing-page - exactly
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:39:18 GMT):<br/>
it will also be a reasonable place to but slides and other marketing-like artifacts that we want folks do be able to download but don't currently have a great home
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:44:21 GMT):<br/>
@ChrisSpanton @adamgering from a roadmap perspective, it might be good for next directory to support deployment on Sabre eventually, because the management story is much better from a deployment standpoint. would require rewriting the TP though in (probably) Rust. we recently rewrite supply chain TP so it is Sabre-compatible. so currently supply chain can run as either a stand alone TP or as a sabre smart contract.
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:47:31 GMT):<br/>
I've been going through the supply chain source code. Indeed that will be something worth considering.
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:50:05 GMT):<br/>
For the docs, Sphinx is still the primary documentation platform? How does Jekyll plug in?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:57:45 GMT):<br/>
yes, sphinx is the standard for docs. we plan on using jekyll for sawtooth-website because we want to enable building a better website (and currently perceive it as enabling that more than sphinx). sphinx has worked well, and its cool we can generate PDFs and such (which, BTW, I think we should expose to users but right now we just build). as long as every component is using sphinx, when we get to step (5) and try and merge docs in some more creative ways I think we will be fairly successful at getting what we want as an end result.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:58:22 GMT):<br/>
we aren't using jekyll yet, that's a new thing we are going to try and enable this week in the website repo
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:59:35 GMT):<br/>
Ok, excellent. I will be watching docs repo on core and taking some hints from there.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 17:59:53 GMT):<br/>
for docs, I think of it as "we are trying to write a book" and try and set our expectations at that level in terms of review
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 18:00:21 GMT):<br/>
How is sawtooth.hyperledger.org hosted?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 18:01:23 GMT):<br/>
via apache currently
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 18:01:50 GMT):<br/>
the idea was to allow us to put rewrite rules to keep urls working, though we haven't done a lot of that yet
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 18:04:24 GMT):<br/>
Let us know when you are looking to "merge docs from different repos" and we can make sure NEXT Directory docs is compatible for merging, just in case it makes sense to do so (I'm not sure it does).
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 18:05:49 GMT):<br/>
probably before that we can just publish them like we do supply chain - https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 18:07:54 GMT):<br/>
we have some script-fu that grabs the tar balls from jenkins (once a night for nightly, on command for releases)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 18:08:33 GMT):<br/>
those scripts will make it into the website repo too, just not as interesting to talk about :)
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 18:31:06 GMT):<br/>
rbac-server is presently failing on a python exception.

"rbac-server_1  |     "Cannot subscript an existing Union. Use Union[u, t] instead.")
rbac-server_1  | TypeError: Cannot subscript an existing Union. Use Union[u, t] instead."

It appears this is being caused by a breaking change in a python library dependency and not any recent commit.
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 18:31:28 GMT):<br/>
Anyone able to take a look at that?
</p>
<p><strong>PhuocDo</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 18:59:18 GMT):<br/>
@kthblmfld do you mean move config.py.example to config.py instead of copy? I tried that, same error.
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Mon, 17 Sep 2018 18:59:47 GMT):<br/>
Actually, it looks like a defect was merged into master last week

@kthblmfld I havent seen a PR yet for the MAINTAINERS.md addition... have you started to work on that? I'll do so if not
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 22:50:26 GMT):<br/>
Hey @ChrisSpanton No, haven't started on it but we need one
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 22:51:34 GMT):<br/>
@adamgering  was looking for Phil's handle earlier
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 22:52:17 GMT):<br/>
Got it. Expect some chatter as we flesh out the initial list. Per @amundson we should follow the standard of requiring existing maintainers to approve the commit to change it before the HL team grants the permissions
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 22:52:41 GMT):<br/>
Deal
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:06:03 GMT):<br/>
@all OK folks - proposal was to vote folks in to MAINTAINERS.md. Once we work get the base list identified, I'll work with the HL team to get the group set and permissions assigned. I'd like to suggest the following (please let me know if I'm missing anyone, or should remove anyone):

We have additional contributors who were active early in the project, though havent been lately. I'm certainly open to including them if it seems appropriate, but will defer to the greater team
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:08:48 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:14:25 GMT):<br/>
the approach we took in other repos was to base the initial maintainer list on committers
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:14:57 GMT):<br/>
Right. Valuable to have the list there as we build the initial list. Thoughts about recency bias, given the desire to have approval from all before modifying?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:19:00 GMT):<br/>
we did not vote on previous lists of maintainers per-se, we agreed on reasonable rules for constructing the list based on who had written code (based on commits). so we could say "top 5 committers", which would be Boyd, Zac, Darian, Michael, Chris, Yunhang (6, because 5th is tied)
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:19:06 GMT):<br/>
Some of those folks are either long gone or otherwise unresponsive
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:22:19 GMT):<br/>
We can certainly establish guidelines to make this currently relevant (definitely would love to hear what other projects have done however for precedent)
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:23:10 GMT):<br/>
Suppose we make an attempt to reach the folks who fit that description (top 5), and if we don't hear back bump down the line, and if we do confirm whether they would like to be an active maintainer or defer their spot
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:23:58 GMT):<br/>
none of these people are long gone from a Sawtooth perspective
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:24:02 GMT):<br/>
IMHO that would give proper acknowledgement of the contributions from those folks, follow a defined standard, and allow us to build a list of actively engaged maintainers
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:29:49 GMT):<br/>
I would love to open the dialog with the previous maintainers of this repo. They could help us ramp up on it and we could share our findings. 
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:29:58 GMT):<br/>
yeah, you should add them as reviewers too, they might give good input even if it's been a while since they wrote the code
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:30:52 GMT):<br/>
Alright - unless I hear objections, I'll follow that rule set, and reach out to the folks on the list starting tomorrow
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:32:01 GMT):<br/>
My only concern is how many votes we need to add a new contributor. Will we need sign-off from everybody moving forward?
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:32:45 GMT):<br/>
I ask because we have one more person onboarding in the next few weeks and I am hoping they get the access they need
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:32:57 GMT):<br/>
Yes, everyone has to agree.
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:33:03 GMT):<br/>
Ok
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:33:05 GMT):<br/>
certainly people will be able to contribute without being a maintainer
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:33:18 GMT):<br/>
But they can still open PRs
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:33:20 GMT):<br/>
Right
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:33:22 GMT):<br/>
correct
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:33:26 GMT):<br/>
Yea that should be ok
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:35:14 GMT):<br/>
As an open source project, you should never add people as a maintainer just because you hired them; it should be driven by contributions. They should have a track record of commits and everyone should be comfortable they know the community norms, etc. It does mean that a maintainer has to click 'Merge' for them until they get to that point.
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:35:37 GMT):<br/>
Yep
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:35:40 GMT):<br/>
That makes sense
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:35:50 GMT):<br/>
I've onboarded many new employees since we put this in place and it's kind of annoying but seems appropriate.
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:36:25 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:38:26 GMT):<br/>
the other annoying thing is that they can't set reviewers, but there is a file you can add for that - let me find an example
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:39:02 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/blob/master/CODEOWNERS
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:39:42 GMT):<br/>
we were piloting that in the seth repo, because knkski was doing a lot of work before he was a maintainer. that helped a lot.
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:39:52 GMT):<br/>
Hmmm
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:40:10 GMT):<br/>
probably fair to roll it out to the rest of the repos. it's nice that when you create a PR it adds all the maintainers for you.
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:41:13 GMT):<br/>
Does it add contributors to maintainers? Auto-assign code reviewers? Both?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:42:23 GMT):<br/>
that list matches what is in MAINTAINER.md. it's a file solely for github and auto-assigns code reviewers. You can use the file in other ways, but thus far we are avoiding that complexity (this all seems complex enough) and just using it because it gives us auto-assignment.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:43:10 GMT):<br/>
it also then matches the associated github maintainers group since that also matches MAINTAINERS.md
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:47:43 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the input putting this process together @amundson - definitely appreciated.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:48:02 GMT):<br/>
@ChrisSpanton I can update the github permissions once this is checked in so it's all consistent with the other repos.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:48:59 GMT):<br/>
Perfect. I'll start connecting with people tomorrow, and figure they should have a few days to respond? I'll shoot for a commit EOW
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:49:12 GMT):<br/>
for anyone else that isn't in that maintainers list, we need to make sure they are added to another read-only group so that they can do code reviews, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:50:11 GMT):<br/>
(including new developers)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:51:28 GMT):<br/>
that other group is cross-project so when we add someone they can be added as a reviewer for any sawtooth repo. so actually, all the maintainers need to be in that list too. I can try and verify all this when I update it.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:52:04 GMT):<br/>
@ChrisSpanton you could just create the file with that list, then ask them to approve the PR, and if you get all 5/6 approvals, then merge it
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:52:20 GMT):<br/>
if someone wants to op out or something, just update the PR
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:52:35 GMT):<br/>
touche
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:53:01 GMT):<br/>
some of us non-maintainers can throw on our not-important approvals too if we want, showing our support :)

That one looks new

<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:56:05 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth-next-directory?msg=NdmRTQiaYwCnxxAqz) @PhuocDo yes, @adamgering indicated earlier that it appears a sanic change broke it...
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:56:44 GMT):<br/>
We merged a change that sets the version of Sanic to an earlier release

<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 23:56:57 GMT):<br/>
@PhuocDo have you synced with master?

hey everyone. i'd like to leverage sauce labs (https://saucelabs.com/products/open-source-frameworks/selenium) for automated ui tests. it's advertised as free for open source projects, however there is a 5-day approval process. does anyone have any suggestions/objections about whether this is something we might use? more broadly, how does the team feel generally about cloud-based ui testing for this project?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 24 Sep 2018 19:09:56 GMT):<br/>
it is more community-friendly to avoid proprietary solutions to the extent possible (though we have several exceptions - github, JIRA)
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Mon, 24 Sep 2018 19:10:59 GMT):<br/>
@pgobin I am onboard with any level of additional automated testing we can shim in. Saucelabs would help ensure responsive design on the UI. It will require hosting the app somewhere, and managing the data in such a way as to allow multiple (and possible parallel) test runs

Hey, sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, but I've been looking through the linting errors for issue 101 and am mostly seeing a lot of import errors. I've noticed that we have a lot of empty __init__.py files in subdirectories, but can't seem to find a __init__.py file for the whole package in the root project directory. Do we consider the whole project to be one python package, with all of our subdirectories as modules? 
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 28 Sep 2018 00:56:51 GMT):<br/>
Hey @bobonana, this is a fine place for such a question. I am seeing mostly indentation, spacing, tabs vs spaces, trailing whitespace, (oops, my bad) invalid constant naming. Regarding the top-level init.py: I don't think it needs one since some subdirectories are not Python (React, protobuf, tests...)

Hey, I noticed we have a setup.cfg file in the root project directory, is there a setup.py that uses it or requirements.txt?
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Fri, 28 Sep 2018 20:34:44 GMT):<br/>
If not, should we switch to using one? It looks like our DockerFiles are running `pip install <modules>` to install dependencies, but if we included a setup or requirements file in each module we could just have `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `python setup.py install` in our Dockerfile and add or remove dependencies without having to edit them. Developers would be able to automatically install dependencies too which might be good for local dev/testing?

<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Fri, 28 Sep 2018 23:28:24 GMT):<br/>
this was in .pylintrc `missing-docstring,no-member,no-self-use,unused-argument,too-many-arguments,duplicate-code` It doesn't currently work because you need to use specific error codes, not the human-readable error title, but do we want to ignore all of these? 
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Fri, 28 Sep 2018 23:29:41 GMT):<br/>
I was planning on ignoring missing docstrings for now, as discussed this morning, but the rest of these strike me as a little extreme, should I go through and fix those errors, or set them to be ignored in .pylintrc?
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Sat, 29 Sep 2018 04:31:16 GMT):<br/>
*disclaimer: opinions* In the case of unused arg, I would remove the arg. Duplicate code and too many args are usually code smells/indications of a need for refactoring. Missing docstring seems picky since some functions are self-descriptive enough.

<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Mon, 01 Oct 2018 18:48:53 GMT):<br/>
That's fair, Docstrings can be redundant a lot of the time, but it allows greater integration with IDEs (if that's something we want, if not then no biggie). I kinda feel like it'd take a long time to add docstrings to everything, so for now should we just ignore them? What about any of those other ignore statements?
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Mon, 01 Oct 2018 19:24:40 GMT):<br/>
I think the simplest solution would be to use Pylint to find actual coding errors, and use black to auto format style. Black is getting pretty popular and won't break our code, I've tested on a few files already and had good results. We can set Pylint to only report errors and ignore conventions, refactors, and possibly warnings. Would that be okay?
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 14:41:16 GMT):<br/>
Tests should expose all errors, lint is mostly for maintaining uniform code formatting conventions. So whatever looks like best practice.

</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 20:19:49 GMT):<br/>
so should we ignore all errors with the linter and only show warnings?
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 20:53:08 GMT):<br/>
@bobonana Some of those lint disables may have been added so that builds didnt fail if some components were stubbed out but not finished. I would recommend eliminating them and see if you get any errors
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 20:53:35 GMT):<br/>
the `too-many-arguments` is disabled because of the transaction creation methods I would guess
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Wed, 03 Oct 2018 17:43:02 GMT):<br/>
That makes sense. PR #164 should handle all of that. If it gets approved we'll be using Black to auto format any python code, pylint has refactor and convention alerts disabled, so it'll report warnings and errors.

>@mtn217 and I fixed his issue by running sudo apt-get install pkg-config libsecp256k1-dev

while some of our imported python packages/libraries depend on them, they are not available through pip and so wouldn't be in requirements.txt. 
I don't think we could specify them in a setup.py file either. Should it be added to the contributor/developer documentation as a requirement?
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 18:23:40 GMT):<br/>
Yes. If you have a procedure for installing them, then please capture it.
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 18:30:34 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure if there's an OS agnostic way to install them
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 18:31:32 GMT):<br/>
should we just have links to their respective webpages in our documentation and let developers go from there?
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 18:33:56 GMT):<br/>
He ran "sudo apt-get install pkg-config libsecp256k1-dev" on OSX?
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 18:54:42 GMT):<br/>
It would be valuable to at least capture the issue so non-OSX folks can work with it and OSX folks have a checkpoint to continue from
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 18:55:41 GMT):<br/>
Otherwise each person will end up spending hours in the rabbit hole
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 18:57:50 GMT):<br/>
As far as I can tell, these don't work anywhere:
sawtooth_sdk==1.0.5
sawtooth_signing==1.0.5

On OSX they fail. In the docker environment the dependencies are installed via apt-get instead and trying to switch some of them to pip does not work. I don't know any environment where installing these via pip works.

@adamgering, Michael ran it in Ubuntu. They are not available through pip. I think you'll need to either go here: 
https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/
and here:
https://github.com/bitcoin/secp256k1

to build from scratch, or use a package manager like Homebrew (MacOS), APT/etc.(Unix), or Chocolatey(Windows), etc. to install them.
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 19:36:17 GMT):<br/>
I'll add these instructions to the readme.md or contributors.md (whichever is appropriate) and add it to PR #174, but I don't think there's a way to automatically install these for developers, we'll just need to document it, similarly to how we document what version of python we're using, etc.

<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 21:21:55 GMT):<br/>
With regards to OSX, they are either incompatible or require libsecp256k1 to built from source.
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 21:23:21 GMT):<br/>
With regards to the docker environment and linux environments, they come already with apt-get install python3-sawtooth-sdk python3-sawtooth-rest-api, and don't need to be installed again via pip3.
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Fri, 05 Oct 2018 21:30:57 GMT):<br/>
I did attempt to remove apt-get python3-sawtooth-sdk in favor of the pip installed dependency, and that did not work. Didn't have a reason to investigate further.

I did attempt to remove apt-get python3-sawtooth-sdk in favor of the pip installed dependency, and that did not work. Didn't have a reason to investigate further. This was, however, tested on a python base container instead of a sawtooth base container, so that may have been the culprit.

<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 18:00:50 GMT):<br/>
works on my machine running osx, there is a difference between the pip install pkgconfig and the required pkg-config dependency. 

https://pypi.org/project/pkgconfig/

if you want to go full python for portability and ease of installation @adamgering we could try use pykg-config, which is meant as a drop in replacement for pkg-config

</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Tue, 09 Oct 2018 22:45:08 GMT):<br/>
If no one owns the repo, we should know who the owners are, who are not in the maintainers.md.

<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 14:34:39 GMT):<br/>
Did Zac mention that he no longer wished to be a maintainer of the repo? If we want to get Adam in as a maintainer, we can split that PR up into one that adds Adam and another that removes Zac (if thats what he wanted)
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 14:34:53 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 14:37:19 GMT):<br/>
Regarding the ownership question, the repos under `hyperledger/...` are owned by the Hyperledger github organization. So I think the owners of the organization have admin rights on the repo

<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Wed, 10 Oct 2018 21:47:12 GMT):<br/>
Can a non-Dev9er review my PR: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-next-directory/pull/216 ? It is a rather large refactor (no changes to project functionality whatsoever) and I am spending more time keeping it in sync with master at this point than I am in writing unit tests. Please help me out!

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 03:17:17 GMT):<br/>
After talking to @adamgering, I removed some branches from sawtooth-next-directory repo (191, dev-ui, revert-201-documentation), because they were created there by mistake. If this in in err, let me know.
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 03:18:12 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @amundson 
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 03:21:22 GMT):<br/>
The repo currently has very liberal write permissions that aren't consistent with Sawtooth norms. Now that we have maintainers defined, I'd like to adjust those permissions to match the maintainers list. This impacts who can press merge, but not who can create PRs. It also impacts whether an individual's checkmark is green or grey (two green checkmarks required to merge).
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 04:45:05 GMT):<br/>
Great! Having the 2 approval policy in there will help, as will the designated maintainers. Thanks for deleting the branches.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 15:03:26 GMT):<br/>
Absolutely! We've been driving towards that end, via the deployment of maintainers, and the development of branching strategy. We're happy to be moving towards tighter controls here :)
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 16:43:14 GMT):<br/>
@amundson FYI we still have a PR out with a pending change to the maintainers list. @ChrisSpanton If you are ok with extending the size of the maintainers I'd be happy to be a part of sorting out merges as well.  
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:22:42 GMT):<br/>
talked to @nadiab22 a bit and we can get all of our developer dependencies installed through pip except for the sawtooth-rest-api. I found the package here https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/tree/master/rest_api
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:25:40 GMT):<br/>
it's available as a build package through APT as `python3-sawtooth-rest-api, but not through pip. it's all there though, so could we ask someone from hyperledger to make this available through pip, or do it ourselves?
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:26:37 GMT):<br/>
this would streamline things for us, we'd be able to use requirements.dev.txt for all developer dependencies, and it would be completely portable
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:27:22 GMT):<br/>
@bobonana How does this compare/contrast to what @nadiab22 is working on?

</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:28:28 GMT):<br/>
using only requirements.dev.txt would be OS agnostic
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:29:41 GMT):<br/>
doesn't matter if a dev is using a mac, windows machine, ubuntu, etc. as long as they have a good version of pip running they'd be able to install all dependencies and be ready to go with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in a  virtualenv
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:31:04 GMT):<br/>
we can get drop-in replacements for that secp binary and pkg-config through pip, same with the sawtooth-sdk and sawtooth-signing, the only thing we can't get past is sawtooth-rest-api
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:31:58 GMT):<br/>
if we can get that we can streamline the setup process for devs and simplify our documentation (since we don't have to have any OS-specific instructions). 
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:35:50 GMT):<br/>
Is this happening soon? I spend some time haggling with the linter yesterday in support of this: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-next-directory/issues/98
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 18:36:38 GMT):<br/>
I'd like it to, if it did it'd fix our linting issues like now
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 20:11:12 GMT):<br/>
@bobonana we only publish the SDK to pypi; for the rest API and validator, we package debian packages and docker images. rest api will be rewritten in rust at some point, so focusing on python distribution mechanisms isn't necessarily the best long-term option
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 20:12:05 GMT):<br/>
to support dev on the different platforms, most of us use docker
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 20:12:55 GMT):<br/>
@amundson so how should developers run `./bin/run_lint` locally as documented if project code uses the sawtooth-rest-api package? 
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 20:13:17 GMT):<br/>
same with setting up a linter for their IDE
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 20:13:49 GMT):<br/>
are you modifying the rest api? I'm not sure why you would care about linting the sawtooth rest api unless you are coding on it.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 20:14:23 GMT):<br/>
it's not library code
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 20:15:45 GMT):<br/>
also, doesn't next directory provide an application domain rest api? if so, do you really need the sawtooth rest api as a dependency?
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 20:30:36 GMT):<br/>
we import it and use it in our code, which is causing import errors
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 20:31:12 GMT):<br/>
would it be more appropriate to list teh sawtooth-rest-api modules under `--ignored-modules` in the pylint settings in `./setup.cfg`?
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 20:32:01 GMT):<br/>
I'm down for whatever works, haha. I just want to make sure that we get to a point where the linter returns no errors when run locally in an environment built as per our instructions

<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 21:07:36 GMT):<br/>
No opinions yet. Just more questions. What does the future have in store for the python-based sawtooth rest client? What would it take to decouple the client, exceptions, whatever else we are trying to pull in?

</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 23:37:52 GMT):<br/>
@agoldingay There was a misshap in the handling of #226 this morning. 
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 23:37:54 GMT):<br/>
@boydjohnson right, but the linter doesn't see them, we don't get these errors running in containers with the python3-sawtooth-rest-api installed, so I thought that was why the liver was reporting them?
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 23:39:59 GMT):<br/>
I agreed in standup to look into it, but then it was assigned to @bobonana  and @nadiab22 . 
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 23:41:22 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 05:36:50 GMT):<br/>
@bobonana We are thinking about separating build protos from copy/generation to provide stable refs to them, and moving generation to be manual/on-demand when the message schemas change. How does that sound?
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 12 Oct 2018 15:58:56 GMT):<br/>
After some cleanup of the rbac_processor, I have found a few operations that were never implemented (removals of role removal confirmations/rejections). Dropping in placeholder functions with TODOs and creating an issue to revisit.

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Sat, 13 Oct 2018 03:02:17 GMT):<br/>
@kthblmfld checking in auto-generated code is very bad practice. it encourages one-off procedures others can not replicate, besides making git history contain meaningless garbage (for example, in comparison of two commit ids in history, if an intermediate diff is a garbage update-auto-gen code commit, it is not helpful).
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Sat, 13 Oct 2018 03:04:51 GMT):<br/>
if by "copy" you mean duplicate the proto files you need into next-directory repo, I don't see a problem with that, they are relatively stable and even if they get out of sync, it won't be a problem because the validator should remain backward compatible
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Sat, 13 Oct 2018 03:42:49 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth-next-directory?msg=tMuCscgtw3fhcEi3x) @amundson There has been ongoing discussion about the generated files, and I have taken the same position as you since I once dealt with a gen-on-demand maven package requiring a hacky solution using a few plug-ins. My biggest concern is that we might still be targeting the committed directories. This could lead to collisions and side effects. On the other hand, not generating on every build reduces build time and solidifies the imports in python. If it goes sideways then we will revert. Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Sat, 13 Oct 2018 03:44:10 GMT):<br/>
I am not much of a fan of code generation to begin with, but protobufs offer some nice messaging perf improvements

Alright folks, I've heard the complaint that "hierarchical" is a silly word that nobody understands or can spell. Any proposals for another name for this feature?
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 16:19:01 GMT):<br/>
laddered approval, managerial approval, something totally different? I feel like there's a good idea out there, and I dont have it. :)
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 16:51:05 GMT):<br/>
Tough question. "Managerial approval" describes the function but has been branded in retail as a required operation. Approval override?
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 16:52:04 GMT):<br/>
Parent approval?
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 16:54:53 GMT):<br/>
We are describing the case where the approver's manager voluntarily approves on the approver's behalf - not the case where a neglected proposal notifies the next layer up the org hierarchy, correct?
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 16:55:23 GMT):<br/>
Whatever distinguishes those two scenarios more succintly...
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 16:55:29 GMT):<br/>
It covers both IMHO
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 16:56:05 GMT):<br/>
its the translation of the business process that says a manager CAN approve on behalf of their subordinates, the scenarios could vary as described
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 16:56:47 GMT):<br/>
And I guess in reality there are two questions here - first, what are these functions called in code, and second how is the capability branded in retail
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 16:57:56 GMT):<br/>

@warren13245 Awesome! Glad you were able to work through that. Keep an eye on this project space - big changes coming to NEXT over the coming weeks! The UI currently included is rapidly being replaced, and new functionality will come with it.

Hello all - I found that ZenHub has a browser extension that will allow the ZenHub board be integrated into the Sawtooth Repo repo page. You should check it out as it! With the extension you wouldn't need to navigate to zenhub.com to manage the issues.  
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 16:29:48 GMT):<br/>
Is there any benefit to maintaining a "non-dev" environment that copies rather than mounts the files?
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 16:30:14 GMT):<br/>
I don't see any benefit. This was inherited. I'm inclined to get rid of it, unless there are any objections or rationales.
</p>
<p><strong>agoldingay</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 16:53:26 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @mtn206! When I open up the project repo Zenhub is it's own tab now. So, I don't have to open up another browser for Zenhub.
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 17:49:19 GMT):<br/>
@adamgering Agreed on consolidating the two. My only concern is WIN machines, is it just a matter of sharing drives as @warren13245 mentioned?

<p><strong>yunhangc</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 17:53:03 GMT):<br/>
@adamgering I am trying to fix the broken test from hierarchical approval, the code require db connection access to get user resource. so will probably have to mock something. do we have a mock framework in place for unit testing?
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 17:53:29 GMT):<br/>
Those are integration tests, not unit tests. You run them from rbac-shell
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 17:53:53 GMT):<br/>
docker exec -it rbac-shell bash
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 17:54:02 GMT):<br/>
pytest
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 17:54:10 GMT):<br/>
Or non-interactively via:
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 17:54:13 GMT):<br/>
bin/build -t
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 18:00:19 GMT):<br/>
Travis uses bin/build -t
</p>
<p><strong>yunhangc</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 18:04:07 GMT):<br/>
as in the approval transaction creation, we need to get a hierarchy of users to put into the headers, so will have to get the head block and db connection object into the test object   
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 18:08:07 GMT):<br/>
I don't think that has anything to do with test.
You mean to say, you need the list of input addresses?
</p>
<p><strong>yunhangc</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 18:08:27 GMT):<br/>
@adamgering in your integration testing framework, is the rethinkdb connector exposed somewhere
</p>
<p><strong>yunhangc</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 18:08:43 GMT):<br/>
seems all data access are through api_request
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 18:09:53 GMT):<br/>
we should code in a way that doesn't depend upon rethink, but I see your problem.
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 18:10:47 GMT):<br/>
Firstly, fix the broken integration test, that's a non-hierarchical proposal and confirmation.
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 18:11:22 GMT):<br/>
To test hierarchical approval, you'll need to create the hierarchy of users, and get the inputs. There's already a hierarchy there.
</p>
<p><strong>yunhangc</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 18:11:30 GMT):<br/>
ya, i think i can move the test to before so that the pr can go in first
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 18:18:11 GMT):<br/>
To answer the question about DB connection, there's no rethink container in the test docker-compose.
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 18:18:50 GMT):<br/>
We can add one, but blockchain tests should work with only the validator and processor.
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 18:19:23 GMT):<br/>
Testing rethink will require an async test library. pytest-sanic may work.
</p>
<p><strong>yunhangc</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 18:20:27 GMT):<br/>
ya, it feels odd adding rethink into the blockchain package.

</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 18:54:27 GMT):<br/>
those are just shortcuts to the docker-compose commands
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 20:23:20 GMT):<br/>
the issues are with getting docker running properly on his windows machine. I think he's having similar issues to what James had when we went to Microsoft. @kthblmfld do you remember what you guys did to get James up and running? Or does our current documentation already reflect those steps?
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 20:28:35 GMT):<br/>
http://coderbro.com/docker/2017/10/24/docker-volumes-vs-copy.html @adamgering @kthblmfld It looks like it makes a difference when building the image, but not sure if it'll make a difference once we have prebuilt images in dockerhub for non-dev
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 21:30:14 GMT):<br/>
@bobonana The developer setup pages in the Wiki ought to cover all of the blockers I hit with James 
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 21:30:49 GMT):<br/>
I think I even added a blurb about checking out and committing as-is (ie any CRLF/LF issues) 
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 21:31:52 GMT):<br/>
The protobufs were in an inaccessible state in non-dev mode, and there he was having issues in dev mode dues to the mounting of volumes
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 21:32:17 GMT):<br/>
So I created a branch that reverted the protobuf refactor and he deployed that
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 21:33:45 GMT):<br/>
Not sure where things stand regarding dev/non-dev mode and protos at this moment. But I saw @warren13245 seemed to get the app running by granting drive access permissions to Docker 
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 21:34:15 GMT):<br/>

@SumanPapanaboina The current focus is an RBAC solution that integrates with Active Directory, Azure Active Directory and overlays a proposal/approval structure. On the short term roadmap are multi-approvals and hierarchical approvals. There is no support for ACL/ABAC models at this time.

if someone creates a new user in sawtooth do we want that to be a part of the delta sync? 
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 21:03:50 GMT):<br/>
if so, we need to supply an initial password to create a new user in Azure AD https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/beta/api/user_post_users
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 21:04:23 GMT):<br/>
Does LDAP have a similar requirement @kthblmfld @mtn206 
</p>
<p><strong>mtn206</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 21:14:47 GMT):<br/>
For the test instance we have, user objects do not need a password defined, but this could be different for other AD instances
</p>
<p><strong>mtn206</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 21:20:25 GMT):<br/>
Did we decided to create users within NEXT? 
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 21:45:06 GMT):<br/>
if we only make changes to users then AAD outbound delta sync is good to go and I'll make the PR
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 21:45:49 GMT):<br/>
@ChrisSpanton are we allowing user creation in NEXT and syncing them to AD providers?
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 22:44:41 GMT):<br/>
A few thoughts...
We’ll be triggering user creation at TMO from within NEXT, but it will be a custom call which generates the user on the directory side and then syncs it in
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 22:45:27 GMT):<br/>
It should be easy to create from NEXT, but how do we ensure we meet password standards defined by directory environment?
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 22:46:19 GMT):<br/>
Perhaps a generated user is a stub with ‘no access’ and to do anything you need to complete a process somehow? It’s an open discussion IMHO
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 22:46:59 GMT):<br/>
I’m the generic use case, assuming we’ve solved for requirements, then yes I assume many will want to create users from NEXT
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 23:40:11 GMT):<br/>
since this adds a layer of complexity to the delta sync (and questions like 'How do we decide which provider new users get synced to, or do we sync to all providers?') should we include it as a user-story/feature for another sprint?

Also, just made a PR and edited the wiki for windows dev environments, worked through it with Ana and if @Nonj wants to it would be a good first review for him. I'm wondering if instead of having users install libtool, automake, and pkgconfig usign the installers, should we have them install to git-bash as per https://gist.github.com/evanwill/0207876c3243bbb6863e65ec5dc3f058 ?

Request for Feedback:

The project should be decomposed into user stories such that developers and stakeholders can prioritize and timeline the stories, developers have a practiced process for creating new stories, and developers are able to pick up stories to work on.

Brainstorm the components that need to get built to achieve the vision of this project. Decompose those components into deliverable pieces and create a user story for those pieces. Mark that user story "SX [User Story] {Title}", assign them to the current sprint. Put them on the groomed board if they have no dependencies and can be worked on this sprint, otherwise leave them on the backlog board. Don't assign points until picked up.

Epic #406

My thought is to create a User Story for each contributor this sprint, and for each person to attempt to create some user stories that have yet to have been captured, or decompose those that have that require decomposition.

Not blocking.
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 22:15:11 GMT):<br/>
I have had it described to me by multiple other contributors as a blocking issue. It confuses new contributors who do not share our level of insight into this project or it's history. I feel it makes debugging and error tracking excessively difficult and confusing. 
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 22:16:55 GMT):<br/>
We also have two new developers working on Windows who are actively impacted by this. Yes, they can still make contributions, but do we really want to tell them that they need to exit the IDE and run a docker container every time they want to lint their code?
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Mon, 05 Nov 2018 22:46:46 GMT):<br/>
@bobonana understood. I pushed a feature out while my IDE was blowing chunks and it wasn't fun to work around. Are you trying to sort this out now?

Yes, it's perfectly reasonable to run lint in a terminal window and not use an IDE.

PRs and Commits should generally have the same title, so you can easily find the PR from given the commit title.
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 17:00:34 GMT):<br/>
But if we go with the idea that I commit needs to be explicitly oriented towards exactly what it does (ie: feature, crlf, whitespace... all separate commits in one PR), then the PR -> commit relationship becomes one to many
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 17:07:59 GMT):<br/>
@pgobin I would like to discuss the idea of changing requirements for approvals on UI merges during standup, or just float the idea now: I have not been reviewing your PRs. Rather, I have been rubber stamping them with instant approval. We all have, with the occasional non-blocking comment about obvious mistakes (typos, copyright, nitpick). My point: It feels like admin work more than it does code review and quality collaboration.
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 17:09:26 GMT):<br/>
Likewise, we don't receive (and don't expect) much participation in our backend PRs from the front end team. I would like to transition towards an as-needed inclusion between teams so as to ensure the eyes on the PRs are those that add the most value
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 17:09:38 GMT):<br/>
I hope that works for you, too  :)
</p>
<p><strong>pgobin</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 18:35:30 GMT):<br/>
@kthblmfld agreed. i would highly recommend not rubber stamping anything just as a general rule. take a look at https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-next-directory/pull/595 for instance. just glancing at this PR it's clear it doesn't meet a certain baseline. Lint aside, which is being worked (i know it's taking a while, but i'd like to see it implemented by offshore correctly + i've been thoroughly refactoring bad code that may have accidentally got in), there are obvious weird things. this is an example of a PR that should be rejected immediately by the first person to get their hands on reviewing it.
</p>
<p><strong>pgobin</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 18:40:46 GMT):<br/>
i would also like to see comments challenging the rationale of code decisions just like there would be on the backend.
</p>
<p><strong>pgobin</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 18:45:47 GMT):<br/>
so with regard to your idea of eyes on the backend PRs, i like the idea of as-needed. how we want to go about PR participation may just be as a general rule: see a PR, look over a PR. don't understand something then add a comment, whether you're asked as a reviewer or not.
</p>
<p><strong>pgobin</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 18:48:10 GMT):<br/>
that is a good bridge to better collaboration between teams for a start. what do you think?
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 18:53:20 GMT):<br/>
"i would also like to see comments challenging the rationale of code decisions just like there would be on the backend."
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 18:53:38 GMT):<br/>
Absolutely. Point received
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 18:54:13 GMT):<br/>
We have a similar need in the backend to sort out some bad code
</p>
<p><strong>pgobin</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 18:55:08 GMT):<br/>
also when you said as-needed, i may have misinterpreted that. does that mean you want only approvers on a given PR that are relevant to it or does it mean you want to bring in more people on an as-need basis?
</p>
<p><strong>pgobin</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 19:00:07 GMT):<br/>
so for instance with UI PRs, i've been including you, adam, and nadia. am i right in interpreting as-needed as _not_ including those who aren't directly involved in the implemented functionality at hand?
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 19:01:23 GMT):<br/>
It means relaxing requirements on UI work - the idea of required 2 approvers. Since code changes ultimately report up to you regarding UI, it is your approval that really matters
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 19:02:16 GMT):<br/>
If/when that changes during integration and/or if we add React UI contributors, then that could change
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 19:02:31 GMT):<br/>
Or you could do your approval + that of an additional offshore
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 19:03:11 GMT):<br/>
"i like the idea of as-needed. how we want to go about PR participation may just be as a general rule: see a PR, look over a PR. don't understand something then add a comment, whether you're asked as a reviewer or not.

</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 19:03:15 GMT):<br/>
Exactly. Agreed
</p>

<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Sat, 17 Nov 2018 01:28:47 GMT):<br/>
I'll avoid reviewing UI until Phil approves first. The front-end need to tighten up the build (Travis) validation (lint, etc) so the obvious stuff doesn't pass build validation.

<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Sat, 17 Nov 2018 03:29:01 GMT):<br/>
@bobonana @mtn206 I have been trying to sort out some outstanding mismatches in your common refactor and my PR, and am finding some issues in the refactored change. This doesn't affect my work since it isn't using the common features, but we should hold off on any additional consolidation work between the 2 features because they are currently in development. 
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Sat, 17 Nov 2018 03:29:57 GMT):<br/>
Once they are stable, tested, hardened they can be cleaned up. Does that work? Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Sat, 17 Nov 2018 06:26:34 GMT):<br/>
As long as we all agree on it I'm down for whatever. I think one reason behind the refactor was so that we could test and harden a single provider pattern instead of splitting our efforts between the two, but if you feel we've past the point of diminishing returns I'm down to split and stabilize what we have
</p>
<p><strong>kthblmfld</strong> (Sun, 18 Nov 2018 04:56:43 GMT):<br/>
I am generally onboard with cleaning up clutter, deleting functions no longer in use, consolidating duplicate code, but AD and AAD integration is work-in-progress. Hands off until we have the fully built features plz

I am still committed to delivering something by Monday that behaves as expected. Because of this, I may ignore the changelog part of the sync since it is a separate story altogether IMO (if it isn't essential to data sync, then it is a feature in its own right)

Nice. I hit an issue with mapping the object from AD and am hoping the changes in the new filter/map resolve it

Some interesting (and successful) open source contribution guidelines (from Pieter Hintjens of ZMQ):

14. Maintainers SHALL NOT make value judgments on correct patches.
15. Maintainers SHALL merge correct patches from other Contributors rapidly.
18. Any Contributor who has value judgments on a patch SHOULD express these via their own patches.
https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4/
A "correct patch" is:
2. A patch SHOULD be a minimal and accurate answer to exactly one identified and agreed problem.
3. A patch MUST adhere to the code style guidelines of the project if these are defined.
6. A patch MUST compile cleanly and pass project self-tests
+ compliance with 2.6. Evolution of Public Contracts
1. All Public Contracts (APIs or protocols) SHALL be documented.
etc..

it's pointed at our dev LDAP and the dev (deprecated) AAD. I'll update AAD once we get a new instance up with an active subscription. I need to contact michael but once I do I'll spin up a second stg instance tied to an on-prem LDAP if we want that.

<p><strong>PatrickLammers</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 00:02:08 GMT):<br/>
Hi Muhammed -- the reason yours looks blank is that there is no data in the DB.  We should maybe whip up a script that would generate some content for people who are just getting started so they don't see this...  I'll get that on our backlog.  For now, you can click on the M in the upper right to drop down the menu and and go to "manage".  Then select the "roles" tile and then "create a role" in the upper right.   
</p>
<p><strong>PatrickLammers</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 00:02:57 GMT):<br/>
I'm going to assume you have read through the wiki and know what we are trying to accomplish around role based access control so I won't go into that...  
</p>
<p><strong>PatrickLammers</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 00:03:20 GMT):<br/>
Remember that every time you take it down and bring it back up, your DB will be empty again.
</p>
<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Wed, 09 Jan 2019 02:34:24 GMT):<br/>
You can start the app using ```bin/start -p``` if you want to data to persist.

It is reverted - going offline - lets chat about it tomorrow.
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 00:13:50 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @amundson. We are ACTIVELY (like accepted in this sprint active) addressing this in a comprehensive way. We'll be onboard with a consolidated process and permission structure very soon :)
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 00:13:56 GMT):<br/>
thanks for the response!
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 00:44:40 GMT):<br/>
@ChrisSpanton addressing it how? are you planning ot spin the project out of Sawtooth?
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 17:33:04 GMT):<br/>
We're exploring all options. Initially and for the short term, implement an appropriate branching/commit flow and permission to that, allowing us to restrict master. Longer term, determining whether this or elsewhere is the best place for the project.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 18:41:20 GMT):<br/>
I don't think it is appropriate to define any new branching/commit/versioning workflow or new permissioning model without going through the sawtooth governance/rfc process. It's not a T-Mobile-only or next-directory-only "project", or at least it shouldn't be, and we already have norms that work pretty well for Sawtooth. If its what you want to do, I am supportive of spinning next directory off as a lab and eventual HL project (though there is resistence to app projects, which should be considered) with its own governance structure. Right now it's positioned as an Sawtooth example app similar to sawtooth-supply-chain and sawtooth-marketplace, and I suspect that's not how you would describe the project. sawtooth-supply-chain is being spun off as the basis for Hyperledger Grid, and we will probably deprecate sawtooth-supply-chain as a result (or maybe just simplify it if we need to keep it as an example). So, there is good precedent for it.

hey guys
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Mon, 11 Feb 2019 23:16:32 GMT):<br/>
so I'm tracking down the inbound sync bug in ledger-sync
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Mon, 11 Feb 2019 23:16:56 GMT):<br/>
#1122
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Mon, 11 Feb 2019 23:17:55 GMT):<br/>
I'm pretty sure I've got it tracked down to the rethink query in lines 125-132 of rbac/ledger-sync/deltas/updating.py
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Mon, 11 Feb 2019 23:19:48 GMT):<br/>
I think it's replacing the document with the result of merging the changed fields with the document. which is why removing users from a group isn't working
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Mon, 11 Feb 2019 23:20:45 GMT):<br/>
do you guys have any suggestions for how to patch this quickly?

quick question
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 12 Feb 2019 21:17:03 GMT):<br/>
does anybody have an example payload of an entry in hte inbound queue for a delta inbound sync from ldap?
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 12 Feb 2019 21:17:42 GMT):<br/>
for example, when removing a user from a group, what does that look like as a delta inbound entry in the inbound queue
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 12 Feb 2019 21:18:08 GMT):<br/>
Or does anybody have access to the test ldap instance that can help me generate and get that payload
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Fri, 15 Feb 2019 18:08:48 GMT):<br/>
@bobonana we talked about this Wednesday, and you said you would prep and hit me for a sample first thing yesterday :)

I know, I'm sorry, I had to review some PRs, assist Ana with a couple tickets, and deal with some issue with the deployment environments and wasn't able to prepare for the sample changes. We had more issues last night too. I'm reaching out to Nadia and Phil about that now and will make sure I've got my debug statements set locally and run a sync so that we can push that test change. I'll need to have it running for about an hour before we sync on that so that the change comes through in a Delta sync and not the initial sync

<p><strong>PatrickLammers</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 18:10:41 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>PatrickLammers</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 18:11:19 GMT):<br/>
We should be creating UML diagrams and getting them onto the Wiki for public consumption.  
</p>
<p><strong>PatrickLammers</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 18:12:02 GMT):<br/>
*Question:  Which stories in the current sprint *should* result in UML updates/creation?*
</p>
<p><strong>PatrickLammers</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 18:16:02 GMT):<br/>
Related question:  Where should the live in the Wiki?  Create a new page called "UML data flow diagrams" and we paste our diagrams onto that page?
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:18:09 GMT):<br/>
@PatrickLammers I think the more ideal location is to include them in the Sphinx (https://sawtooth-next-directory.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) source, attached to appropriate doc sections
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:19:13 GMT):<br/>
@bobonana @nadiab22 @mtn206 @akgunkel @V1122am @Srinuthalapati thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:20:29 GMT):<br/>
I agree, the Sphinx docs are our official wiki. The old wiki was deprecated a while back and IMHO we should probs remove it
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:20:53 GMT):<br/>
I think every major feature should have a uml diagram 
</p>
<p><strong>PatrickLammers</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:21:27 GMT):<br/>
Perfect!  I see we already have inbound and outbound LDAP sync flow diagrams out there.
</p>
<p><strong>PatrickLammers</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:21:37 GMT):<br/>
are they correct?
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:22:07 GMT):<br/>
So if you touch a feature that does not currently have a diagram, it should probs be a success criteria and the story should be sized appropriately. We can determine this quickly enough during Sprint planning and story sizing once we have our diagrams in Sphinx (and by checking the SharePoint Michael set up for now)
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:23:09 GMT):<br/>
Same as testing. If your contribution breaks a test or you touch a feature that is untested you should probs write integration tests for that feature and size the story to account for the extra work
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:23:32 GMT):<br/>
Unless we want to write extra tech debt tickets to cover those missing tests and diagrams?
</p>
<p><strong>PatrickLammers</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:31:08 GMT):<br/>
tech debt tickets are only a last resort.  Documentation & testing are definitely part of the def of done for every story -- we need to make this part of our regular process.
</p>
<p><strong>PatrickLammers</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:33:22 GMT):<br/>
BTW:  "testing and docmentation is extra work" is a mindset we need to change.  They aren't _extra_... they are key parts of the work.

<p><strong>PatrickLammers</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:41:04 GMT):<br/>
What stories in current sprint will need UML diagrams?
</p>
<p><strong>PatrickLammers</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 20:41:38 GMT):<br/>
Are the current LDAP inbound and outbound diagrams in Sphinx correct?
</p>
<p><strong>mtn206</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 21:30:17 GMT):<br/>
Regarding Chris' suggestion I too agree that we should be placing our UML diagrams in Sphinx docs. 
</p>
<p><strong>mtn206</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 21:31:00 GMT):<br/>
My ticket #334 will be needing UML diagrams not quite sure about the other tickets, perhaps we should discuss about it as a group during stand up 
</p>
<p><strong>mtn206</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 21:32:15 GMT):<br/>
I currently only see one diagram in Sphinx docs and it is not up to date currently

Stepping over to the Tmobile/sawtooth-next-directory repo...  The repo is now live, the code is there and I *think* our premissions are right...  while Chris and I explore bulk moving of issues, i will start by manually cloning the current sprint's stories to the new repo.

<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Tue, 26 Mar 2019 17:28:22 GMT):<br/>
responding to Patrick, but also calling out the understated meta there: T-Mobile is moving our daily PR's and contributions to the Sawtooth-Next-Directory project to a fork, and will be continuing to push PR's at a regular cadence, likely at the end of our sprints. 
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Tue, 26 Mar 2019 17:29:14 GMT):<br/>
Any community members may still continue to submit PR's to the existing repository, or we can discuss providing access to our new daily commit repository, at https://github.com/tmobile/sawtooth-next-directory

Hey fellow Next-ers!  I would like some feedback on the idea of a group design/task breakdown meeting following the next Sprint planning session.  We are still forming as a team and it's clear that there is 'unevenness' in the spread of knowledge about the codebase.  The goal would be make sure that all of the non-trivial stories would get discussed and broken down into tasks *as a team* so we are all on the same page about the work _before it gets under way._

on another note, we currently use tables in rethink for our inbound and outbound queues, in the future after V1 we might want to look into repubsub https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/publish-subscribe/python/  to streamline things and make our code as the way we currently do this works but is a little clunky. It's by no means a priority concern tho. Anybody have thoughts on this?
</p>
<p><strong>nadiab22</strong> (Mon, 22 Apr 2019 16:50:33 GMT):<br/>
Could be a good solution.  I would make a ticket to evaluate the possibility of using this or finding a different solution for future sprints

</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 19:47:03 GMT):<br/>
you can set overrides or just use the environment parameters in the docker-test.yaml to set the mock server creds

</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 20:04:24 GMT):<br/>
You'll need to override the .env file with environment values in the `docker-test.yaml` file anyway as I don't think the travis .env file enables ldap or azure syncs. I'm not sure how that'll affect the running project though, since the mock ldap server is created and removed as a module level fixture, right? You might need to see if there's a way to set up a global fixture, or what exactly the best practice would be in this situation. Do you have any feedback @nadiab22 ?

How many dev hours do we typically spend every sprint stabilizing deployments? I'd guess we're pretty close to the point of diminishing returns, if we haven't already exceeded it, with our current deployment methods 
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 16:19:51 GMT):<br/>
Thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>PatrickLammers</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 21:32:38 GMT):<br/>
We shouldn't have to spend *any* hours stabilizing deployments...  ideally all changes are carefully reviewed, unit tested and validated locally before they are merged.  What was the root cause of today's outage?
</p>
<p><strong>PatrickLammers</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 21:34:30 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:07:11 GMT):<br/>
there's a PR up now
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:07:20 GMT):<br/>
were all 3 of us working on that?
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:09:28 GMT):<br/>
that feels kinda wasteful, no? can we start making a weekly/bi-weekly ops ticket or something if we're not going to address these deployment issues with an epic for v1? It'd be nice to know exactly which dev is responsible for maintaining deployments at a given time. we could have them it would more accurately reflect the amount of work we're doing, and prevent that kind of wasteful overlap (which helps us push more features for v1 at a faster rate)
</p>
<p><strong>mtn206</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:13:16 GMT):<br/>
We can decide in stand up on who will be the main point of contact for troubleshooting our deployments 
</p>
<p><strong>mtn206</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:13:16 GMT):<br/>
We can decide in stand up on who will be the main point of contact for troubleshooting our deployments for that day
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:15:39 GMT):<br/>
I'm not talking about a permanent PoC. nobody on this team wants to be the "ops person" but we're devoting a ton of hours to this and there's some massively wasteful overlap. We might as well have a weekly/bi-weekly rotating "ops" ticket or something since we're doing devops and not going to devote time to stabilizing our deployments, right?
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:17:48 GMT):<br/>
that way we each get a taste of it and can understand it more, and nobody feels pressured due to spending a lot of time on ops instead of working on tangible tickets. It doesn't feel great as a dev to walk into standup and say "I fixed the deployment" when everyone else made what feels like meaningful contributions
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:18:00 GMT):<br/>
especially when it's a pattern and visibly impacts our contributions
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:21:31 GMT):<br/>
@PatrickLammers  *the issue in this case was a conflict from a dev changing a source file on the server. No idea who made the change or why, but a hard git reset fixed things.  We were also having an issue with one of the environment variable defaults that my PR fixes*
</p>
<p><strong>PatrickLammers</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:24:45 GMT):<br/>
was the file that had been edited on the server the .env file?
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:31:42 GMT):<br/>
no
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:32:30 GMT):<br/>
i mean, it had a variable commented out, but there was a change to one of the source files that was causing a git conflict when the deployment script tried to fetch and merge
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:33:41 GMT):<br/>
after resetting and rebasing I got an error due to the missing env variable. I added a default value, logged teh bug in a ticket, and pushed the fix (literally a few characters)
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:34:19 GMT):<br/>
tbh, `local` was pitched to us as an unstable dev standbox, no? so aren't we supposed to go in and mess with it because it doesn't have to be stable?
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:34:26 GMT):<br/>
or am I incorrect?
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:34:26 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:36:15 GMT):<br/>
or is that `dev`?
</p>
<p><strong>PatrickLammers</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:42:04 GMT):<br/>
Dev is the unstable sandbox.  Local/stage are the daily builds to gather early feedback. 
</p>
<p><strong>PatrickLammers</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:44:13 GMT):<br/>
We wouldn't want these endpoint's down for extended periods because that's just more changes to examine in debugging an issue

Hey gang!  Chris and Ricky tasked me with documenting our usage of ZenHub so that new team members can quickly get up to speed with our process.  In putting together my first draft I noticed some redundancy -- We have 6 pipelines in our workflow...  but "Sprint committed" sticks out as not really being used in our ScrumBan process.    Likewise, we use labels to categorize issues into 24 types -- with the exception of 'refined' which is used to indicate a step in our workflow.  How about we stick to using the ZenHub pipelines for workflow by renaming 'Sprint Committed" to be "refined" and put our refined stories there instead of labeling them?  
</p>
<p><strong>PatrickLammers</strong> (Wed, 08 May 2019 21:16:24 GMT):<br/>
Thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>ChrisSpanton</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 18:18:02 GMT):<br/>
I think that's a good find on the inconsistency front, and it makes sense to keep with a single taxonomy as you've proposed
</p>
<p><strong>akgunkel</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 22:14:47 GMT):<br/>
I assume that means we are sticking with our ScrumBan process for a while, which I'm OK with.  But I'm not sure where Refined fits in to the pipeline in relation to Backlog & On Deck and being able to prioritize things out of the backlog.   Using a label allowed us to refine any story in the backlog or on deck, so that we can have a collection of items refined & prioritized.  If we are going to make refined a pipeline stage, should it then come before On Deck, so that only items that have already been refined can be placed On Deck?

@ChrisSpanton @PatrickLammers since we've been implementing NEXT admins we've been trying to figure out what the purpose of role admins is and how they play into admin/owner restricted functionality. do either of you have details on that? Are role admins deprecated?

@ChrisSpanton @PatrickLammers Also, the update_manager endpoint currently creates a proposal

<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 22:17:55 GMT):<br/>
@ChrisSpanton @PatrickLammers Also, the update_manager endpoint currently only creates a proposal. what's teh desired behavior here? i.e.: should this endpoint only be called by a NEXT admin and be autoapproved? should users be able to change the managers of their direct reports (shoudl should that be autoapproved then?)? should any user be able to invoke this endpoint and create an update manager proposal? Should a proposal even be created or should we auth the user and push the transaction through as a change (like with user creation, etc.)
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 23:13:33 GMT):<br/>
hey all, does the admin account not come up for anybody else when running integration tests?
</p>
<p><strong>mtn206</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 23:15:06 GMT):<br/>
Yeah it isn't coming up to me either because rbac-provider-ldap service isn't being ran when we run integration tests
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Fri, 31 May 2019 23:16:52 GMT):<br/>
so why'd we use that to bootstrap the admin account and role?

is ticket #418 purely UI?

<p><strong>PatrickLammers</strong> (Wed, 05 Jun 2019 16:00:37 GMT):<br/>
I don't think so...  we should discuss the user experience here

what do you mean by "here"?

<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 18:49:25 GMT):<br/>
Hey all, should we maybe consider changing our 200 responses to 202 down the road to reflect that it's a confirmation of successful submission of a message to sawtooth but not rethinkDB? (might be useful once we delay the head block to handle forking?) https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/202
</p>
<p><strong>mtn206</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 21:09:29 GMT):<br/>
But this might cause confusion because if a user tries to hit our endpoint and they receive a 202 it might appear that the process of the API endpoint might have not fully completed. We had a little discussion yesterday regarding it was okay to send a 200 as a response to the API endpoint because it has completed the desired functions within the API. Even though the object has not been 100% updated/created/deleted from the Sawtooth blockchain and/or RethinkDb.  
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 20:12:23 GMT):<br/>
I'm still not understanding how a 202 message is confusing. I mean, what part of our architecture doesn't align with the description of a 202 response? 
</p>
<p><strong>bobonana</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 20:15:11 GMT):<br/>
>The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 202 Accepted response status code indicates that the request has been received but not yet acted upon. It is non-committal, *meaning that there is no way for the HTTP to later send an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of processing the request. It is intended for cases where another process or server handles the request, or for batch processing*.

I mean, this sounds almost exactly like our case where a successful submission indicates that the message has been accepted by the validator node but not yet added to the chain with consensus, and has not yet been added to rethink. and there's no way for us to send an asynchronus response indicating that it has been added to rethink. right?

@arsulegai seems like something that might fit better with grid though, and would have to be designed in that context. at a minimum, needs to be rewritten from scratch as sabre contracts and rust apis too.

Maybe creating a labs project around it with a new charter to become part of grid or something? Either way, such a project could be inspired by this even if its archived.
