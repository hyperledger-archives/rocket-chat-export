Lint aside, which is being worked (i know it's taking a while, but i'd like to see it implemented by offshore correctly + i've been thoroughly refactoring bad code that may have accidentally got in), there are obvious weird things. this is an example of a PR that should be rejected immediately by the first person to get their hands on reviewing it.","username":"pgobin","ts":"2018-11-16T18:35:30.106Z"}

Likewise, we use labels to categorize issues into 24 types -- with the exception of 'refined' which is used to indicate a step in our workflow.
