maybe a little ahead of that, 4814be165df4973c65589deab75f41602202b4fa, to pick up some doc commits. then everything else we want as backports (poet removal for example)

`4814be` seems conservative, but conservative is probably good, since we can always backport later fixes.  Commits that would be nice to backport are the commits added in `d864b2f59` and `4c80898d7`.

I'd rather be aggressive .. backports seem like they take 10x longer than getting them in initially.

<p><strong>boydjohnson</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 15:35:30 GMT):<br/>
I'll look later today for an aggressive option.

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 24 Aug 2018 18:17:03 GMT):<br/>
Don't look too hard though ;) I'll channel Tom and say conservative is good.
I just meant if you were on the fence for the two you listed I'd nudge you over there. :)
If we branch before Monday it's good timing to start an LR7 on the first candidate build.

Are we still using lmdb (py-lmdb) now that we've moved to Rust? Are there other Python packages still called out in setup.py files that are no longer being used?
thew py-lmdb project no longer has a maintainer, so its probably not a good component to be using in the long term.

`4f5bd10a4` would be a good aggressive option. The block manager commits before it don't use the block manager in the actual validator.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 27 Aug 2018 16:14:17 GMT):<br/>
We don't really want an aggressive option - I believe Adam selected that initial commit based on a bunch of testing that we have already done at that specific point. That's attractive if we want a release in September.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 27 Aug 2018 16:16:32 GMT):<br/>
@Dan ^
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Mon, 27 Aug 2018 16:17:32 GMT):<br/>
That commit comes up as July 31 and I know we've had LR7 success all month.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 27 Aug 2018 16:17:35 GMT):<br/>
My preference is to go with Adam's suggestion and then do backports that we feel are super important and/or won't cause stability issues that cause a longer testing cycle.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Mon, 27 Aug 2018 16:18:09 GMT):<br/>
If there's some specific risk like there was cache debugging subsequent to that then I'm easily persuaded to the more conservative path.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 27 Aug 2018 16:20:00 GMT):<br/>
Unfortunately, Adam is on vacation and he made that initial recommendation and is probably in the best position to describe why he picked it.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Mon, 27 Aug 2018 19:24:49 GMT):<br/>
Well I guess we can pick the conservative option and play backport or we can roll the dice on the aggressive commit and fall back to the conservative if we have instability.
I'm in favor of including block manager as it alleviated race conditions. So I feel like conservative isn't necessarily more stable.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 27 Aug 2018 19:30:20 GMT):<br/>
@Dan Are you just advocating for taking current master then?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Mon, 27 Aug 2018 19:32:04 GMT):<br/>
I was leaning towards commit 4f5bd10a4 as the aggressive commit. I think that's still about 3 weeks back in the history.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Mon, 27 Aug 2018 19:32:19 GMT):<br/>
I know we've had stable LR7 runs since that went in.
</p>
<p><strong>TomBarnes</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 16:15:43 GMT):<br/>
When we choose the sawtooth-core 1.1 branch, I think we will also want to choose the sawtooth-poet and sawtooth-raft branch so that all can be tested together.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 16:16:26 GMT):<br/>
@pschwarz how stable is BlockManager at that point? I believe there were some fixes in the last couple weeks. Would we want to grab that commit `4f5bd10a4` and then backport other BlockManager commits. Or is it so not stable at 4f5bd10a4 that we are better taking one of the earlier suggested commits and not including BlockManager at all? 
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 17:18:40 GMT):<br/>
Could you link to those commits?  I couldn't tell you what's in them by hash. I'm not _that_ good
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 18:10:56 GMT):<br/>
@TomBarnes probably no need to branch poet or raft yet. the reason for branching core is that master will become 1.2
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 18:12:03 GMT):<br/>
we probably a stable pre-psefree poet branch at some point, but probably not necessary yet
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 18:12:27 GMT):<br/>
no plans to do multiple lines of development on raft, AFAIK, so no branching required there
</p>
<p><strong>TomBarnes</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 15:24:45 GMT):<br/>
@amundson so then we run LR tests with the 1.1 branch of sawtooth_core and the head of sawtooth-poet and sawtooth-raft?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 17:19:35 GMT):<br/>
@pschwarz that commit is actually removing the java sdk, but I gather from @boydjohnson that it is the commit after blockstore is enabled
https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/pull/1734
Probably best to just look at git log.
Besides 4f5bd10a4 as the aggressive commit, other more conservative commits were listed here:https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth-release?msg=Ra7Pu6cFamcKqhJxR
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 20:11:14 GMT):<br/>
@TomBarnes yes, and in the short term we could start LR tests against main of all three and then switch over the core pieces to the branch when we get everyone on the same page for the branch point. those LR tests would be useful to inform the branch point decision too, though I don't want to wait too long before branching since we have a lot tasks to do after we branch.
</p>
<p><strong>TomBarnes</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 20:12:17 GMT):<br/>
@amundson i think we are already running LR tests on main  - will provide updates this week.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 20:13:15 GMT):<br/>
@TomBarnes ok, I would be interested to know what commit ids from core and the associated results

Hi there. Do you know the reason why the HL Sawtooth has by default lmdb setting WRITEMAP set to True? It doesn't help much on OSX, when linking volume with blockchain content (no sufficient disk space error). On Ubuntu and WIndows works fine. If there is a good reason behind it, i'll understand, but if not, then i'm curious if it can be changed in next releases.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 14:45:31 GMT):<br/>
@nubirstein that's a good question for #sawtooth this channel we are trying to focus on release process. In general though settings are designed for deployment on ubuntu. Many of us develop on other platforms but the deployment target is ubuntu.
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 21:26:02 GMT):<br/>
As far as what commits to test on, current master is pretty stable: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/commit/795699545bf285d817700d03e352d0ba72ef5679

Once we have consensus, I'll create the branch and we will start churning through the tasks (creating repos, etc.). Monday is a holiday, so maybe better to target mid-week for having the first artifacts available in the new repos.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 01:31:27 GMT):<br/>

@pankajgoyal Please treat this coming Monday's nightly master as a 1.1 candidate. I think you'd be using that for LR7 anyway.

@amundson I'm still not sure I understand why we wont need a branch for raft and poet - will we simply test with poet/master and raft/master and continue to make changes to them?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 01:37:37 GMT):<br/>
it seems we'd want to tag them or something
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 01:39:07 GMT):<br/>
we will tag them as necessary to stamp a version number on them when the time comes
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 01:41:34 GMT):<br/>
@TomBarnes the reason for branching is so we can maintain an additional version of the code. we can have multiple releases on master, and only need to branch when we are considering two separate releases being managed in parallel. so for example, in sawtooth-core's master, we have been working toward 1.1.x - thus, we have needed the 1-0 branch because in parallel we have been doing 1.0.x releases.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 01:43:44 GMT):<br/>
when we consider raft, the same version/release will work against both sawtooth-core 1.1.x and 1.2.x; so no need to branch raft. if at some point we need to manage multiple releases of raft at the same time, we can create a branch.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 01:48:49 GMT):<br/>
same for applications; almost all can support running on sawtooth core 1.0 or sawtooth core 1.1, so no reason to branch them even if we cut releases for them
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 01:53:45 GMT):<br/>
it seems likely we will want to branch poet once pse-free is active in master, simply because we might want to do releases of the "older" poet as it currently exists. I don't perceive that as important this week.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 01:55:08 GMT):<br/>
this also presumes we can keep our PRs under control and don't wildly go merging in things that would interfere with our release timeline
</p>
<p><strong>TomBarnes</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 15:00:38 GMT):<br/>
@amundson Perhaps I'm asking for the wrong thing.  What I want is to have a well defined instance of Raft to test against, and when the release goes out be able to identify which instances were tested together. So maybe that's not a branch - is it a version number?  How will we identify which versions of the various component of a 1.1 release were tested and verified to work together?

@Dan @amundson @jsmitchell @agunde:

I suggested using 0edde5778c647ffc9f424297e59d6ad14cb2e98d because it includes the new consensus api changes and is the commit that @pschwarz , @boydjohnson, and myself have done the most long-running testing with. I am fine with jumping ahead to include doc changes and the separation of the PoET repo.

I am less comfortable recommending the release of the subsequent changes to integrate the block manager and rewrite the block validator in Rust. There is a known performance issue with these changes that we have been investigating and that should be resolved before including these changes in a release. I would like to include these changes in a 1.1.2 or 1.2 release once the issue has been resolved.

fwiw, 1.2 is likely in the december timeframe. we can do 1.1.x point releases would be driven by our testing turnaround time
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 19:22:42 GMT):<br/>
I am (and have been) fine with Adam’s proposed branch point. @Dan and others, can we agree on that as an initial branch and have further discussion as backport proposals? I can prepare some backport branches (docs, poet, etc.).
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 19:24:52 GMT):<br/>
We have a lot of things held up on this from a build perspective so it would be good if I can create the branch today so tomorrow we can start on the next todo.

@pschwarz could thumbs up/down `0aa154c7e23bd887c7496d54806e78b929feb4d9` and `4c80898d7ab045d18c414dd28e40067fdc710ad6` which seem to impact back pressure.

There's a couple block store commits @boydjohnson could thumbs up/down (`c2c2f8f544ac50fb38edc7c78bce02e69472fbf2`, `a7a1bf55cd7a2b0995d2ed7fc36fe081c5e23145`).
If those are in the clear there's lots more commits (build system, docs, etc.) we could fast forward through.. 
then I start seeing blockmanager commits around here `3f3c469c550c65841fbd80b966ca33eaebd66452`

<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 22:43:13 GMT):<br/>
@Dan `0edde5778c` is the commit I am most confident in from a performance and stability perspective. If the goal is to get as far forward as possible without getting ensnared in the issue I mentioned above, I think we could safely go as far as `8440e8702afdec4d538d928d14674b392d17994a`, though I don't know whether that commit has been run in a long running environment before.

This would include a number of nice things such as:
- doc updates
- removal of poet
- workload debs
- a couple consensus api fixes not used by poet

<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Wed, 05 Sep 2018 15:22:29 GMT):<br/>
@TomBarnes Your python list looks correct. Your Rust list is missing clap and libc, and "sawtooth_sdk" is not a 3rd-party library.
</p>
<p><strong>TomBarnes</strong> (Wed, 05 Sep 2018 16:51:12 GMT):<br/>
@adamludvik thanks for reviewing Adam. I've got clap and libc - that was a cut a paste error on my part.  and agreed Sawtooth-sdk should not be on that list.
</p>
<p><strong>TomBarnes</strong> (Wed, 05 Sep 2018 17:16:17 GMT):<br/>
@adamludvik are we still using python3-lmdb? I thought all of the LMDB interfaces moved to Rust.  I ask because the Python LMDB adapter project is no longer being maintained, and it represents a  security concern since without a maintainer, there is no way to get anything fixed if a vulnerability in that component is identified.
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Wed, 05 Sep 2018 17:20:07 GMT):<br/>
Yes, we are still using python3-lmdb.

<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Wed, 05 Sep 2018 19:40:11 GMT):<br/>
And, if I recall correctly, it is used by PoET
</p>
<p><strong>TomBarnes</strong> (Wed, 05 Sep 2018 19:49:49 GMT):<br/>
@pschwarz Thanks.  Do you think it will be removed by the time we get to Sawtooth 1.2 release in December?  I will check on PoET 2 - I think it has eliminated dependency on Python access to LMDB.
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Wed, 05 Sep 2018 19:52:21 GMT):<br/>
I don't think it's a big lift to get it out of there - we replaced one usage, but need to replace two more, which require a little bit more FFI work on our part
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 05 Sep 2018 19:52:37 GMT):<br/>

question about unit test coverage: are these unit test coverage reports still meaningful? https://build.sawtooth.me/job/Sawtooth-Hyperledger/job/sawtooth-core/job/master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/coverage/html/index.html
</p>
<p><strong>TomBarnes</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 00:29:39 GMT):<br/>
...that is, are all of these unit tests still exercising active Sawtooth code (and not legacy Python code that's been replaced by Rust code)?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 14:28:07 GMT):<br/>
@TomBarnes it is still meaningful for the python code (code gets removed from the repo when its been replaced)
</p>
<p><strong>TomBarnes</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 16:17:23 GMT):<br/>
@amundson doesn't seem to be limited to Python - i notice that a number of the tests exercise underlying Rust code via ffi.  Trying to think about how to characterize that coverage.  
</p>
<p><strong>TomBarnes</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 16:18:09 GMT):<br/>
@amundson ... and good to know that the tests are not executing dead code - thanks
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 17:15:02 GMT):<br/>
sure, the rust code is getting tested. but that tool is definitely not aware enough to report on it.

<p><strong>TomBarnes</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 17:15:13 GMT):<br/>
```
agreed

</p>
<p><strong>TomBarnes</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 17:23:58 GMT):<br/>
There are 398 pub rust functions.  Only 71 pub unsafe (ffi) functions.  So even if there were python tests for every pub unsafe function, the code coverage would not be great.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 17:24:51 GMT):<br/>
functions call other functions though, so I'm not sure I follow that logic
</p>
<p><strong>TomBarnes</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 17:26:08 GMT):<br/>
agreed - when i get some time i'll see if I can improve my metric
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 17:26:22 GMT):<br/>
keep in mind the "unit tests" include running a validator with intkey smoke, so almost certainly the code coverage is high
</p>
<p><strong>TomBarnes</strong> (Thu, 06 Sep 2018 17:26:37 GMT):<br/>
good point

@Dan @pschwarz @ltseeley @amundson I would like to get this PR merged, so that the Raft repo is setup to do releases from: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-raft/pull/26 @rberg2 has pointed out that merging the PR would implicitly create a 0.1.0 "release". I think it makes sense to merge this PR now and have 0.1.0 be a "soft-release", meaning we don't do the normal release tasks like publishing debs to stable, publishing docs, etc., and have 0.1.1 be the first "hard-release". Does anyone have opinions on this or am I thinking about it wrong?

</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 16:04:15 GMT):<br/>
I'm fine w/ merging and 'soft' release.
I do think we need debs published from this repo/component associated with sawtooth 1.1.
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 16:14:43 GMT):<br/>
Yes to publishing with 1.1, that is the plan
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 16:15:55 GMT):<br/>
@adamludvik @rberg2 you have to tag to do a release. does this actually work without any tags?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 16:17:00 GMT):<br/>
this is what I suggest: merge the PR, then create a v0.1.0 tag and then bump version to 0.1.1. this will make get_version operate properly and it is consistent with what we have done everywhere else.
</p>
<p><strong>rberg2</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 16:17:43 GMT):<br/>
thats what I was getting at when I brought this stuff up with Adam.
</p>
<p><strong>rberg2</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 16:19:07 GMT):<br/>
do we do the 0.1.0 tag now and release 0.1.1?
</p>
<p><strong>rberg2</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 16:20:44 GMT):<br/>
that sounds like what Amundson is suggesting
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 16:21:46 GMT):<br/>
@amundson So we do the merge/0.1.0 tag, and a follow up PR to set the version to 0.1.1 now. That completes the 0.1.0 "soft-release". Later when we are ready to release 0.1.1 we do something similar?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 16:27:23 GMT):<br/>
@adamludvik I would let @rberg2 or myself do the actual tag and increment commit. we tend to avoid PRs to make sure it's atomic and that requires convincing github temporarily to allow it.
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 16:28:11 GMT):<br/>
Gotcha. Is there anything blocking that from being done now, or any reason to wait?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 16:28:30 GMT):<br/>
you _could_ merge in the commit, but if the history is non-linear then the commit-since-tag math is wack
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 16:28:51 GMT):<br/>
no reason I know of
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 16:30:30 GMT):<br/>
Alright, I think we should go ahead as soon as priorities allow.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 16:37:30 GMT):<br/>
We had some discussion about a sawtooth 1.1 meta-package. What is that artifact (a deb? a repo?) and do we have clarity on what it contains? (sawtooth-core 1.1, sawtooth-raft 0.1.1, sawtooth-poet x.y.z, ...)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 16:42:08 GMT):<br/>
at a "distribution level", the bumper repo will contain all the individually versioned components compatible with core 1.1.x. if we stick with "Sawtooth 1.1" as the marketing name, then that refers to the bumper repo basically. It will also apply to anything else cross-cutting like docker compose files and website content.
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 16:45:27 GMT):<br/>
@amundson Are you suggesting the meta-package and repo are synonymous? I would expect that "meta-package" refers to an "empty" deb package that has as its dependencies a semi-opinionated set of other sawtooth-packages that you can install with one command.
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 16:46:13 GMT):<br/>
So maybe `apt-get install sawtooth` gets you everything you need to run a devmode validator with an intkey workload.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 16:47:18 GMT):<br/>
no, I'm not suggesting they are the same. we also have a 'sawtooth' meta package for convenience but the way it works is too dumb to really care about versions
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 17:06:39 GMT):<br/>
I support @amundson's view of what the bumper repo should contain. I think we should discuss what is installed with the meta package in that repo.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 17:07:36 GMT):<br/>
probably the same as previously minus poet

if it is essentially "all the stuff from core to run sawtooth" then that makes the versioning make more sense
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 17:08:54 GMT):<br/>
Unrelated question, sorry if this was already discussed: why are we publishing the 1.1 repos to `http://repo.sawtooth.me/ubuntu/bumper/*` and not `http://repo.sawtooth.me/ubuntu/1.1/*`?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 17:18:31 GMT):<br/>
there was a brief thread about it a while ago. basically, it is confusing to talk about version numbers at the distribution level, especially when they match some components and not others. so we adopted the standard convention to use a code name instead (pinball theme, thus bumper). this lets us switch to 'Sawtooth 18.10" or "Sawtooth 2" or another top-level version scheme without changing our repo URL. (separation of concerns). @Dan is still advocating for "Sawtooth 1.1" as the top-level name. I'm not sure it benefits us to stick to that version scheme at that level. But, this way, we can debate it on marketing grounds solely as it won't impact the mechanics.
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 17:25:42 GMT):<br/>
So basically the advantage of a named release is decoupling: the release becomes a set of (package, version) pairs instead of a set of packages all with the same version?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 17:27:33 GMT):<br/>
correct, the release is a distribution of software, not a single piece. the same version of supply chain and such might end up in both the 1.0 and bumper repos because they work with both.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 17:28:15 GMT):<br/>
most of the SDKs will not get a 1.1.x version bump as they are still 1.0-compatible because of our stable APIs
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 17:29:45 GMT):<br/>
Makes sense to me.
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 17:29:58 GMT):<br/>
Will `http://repo.sawtooth.me/ubuntu/nightly` continue to track master?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 17:33:59 GMT):<br/>
sounds correct
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 17:37:25 GMT):<br/>
Back to the bumper discussion, how will people know which versions of which packages are compatible with each other? Will this be a requirement for membership in the apt repo? Do we need to differentiate between named releases (cross-package distros?) and version releases (single package changes) to avoid community confusion?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 17:41:51 GMT):<br/>
```
bumper repo {
   sawtooth 1.1 meta-package {
      <can someone enumerate this>
   }
   sawtooth-poet <version> {
       poet-simulator //CFT
       // Not poet-sgx //BFT
   }
   sawtooth-raft <version> {}
}
```
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 17:56:31 GMT):<br/>
@adamludvik well, everything in the bumper repo will work together. or do you mean when it's not in the repo?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 17:58:07 GMT):<br/>
currently for bumper it's really a sawtooth-core centric release, so it's stuff compatible with sawtooth-core 1.1. I could see a future release where core stays the same but we have other components like sabre or not-yet-written driving the distribution release compatibility
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 18:03:32 GMT):<br/>
It sounds like it is important clarify what is meant by "Sawtooth Release". For the sake of argument, I will take the position that it should mean a versioned core release: 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, etc. In that case, I don't think it makes sense to do another "big release" in order to add new components, you would just release that component with whatever version you want and then add it to the apt repo. Maybe you call this a sawtooth "distro" or something.
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 18:12:06 GMT):<br/>
Let me know if I am retreading old ground and need to go read an earlier conversation
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 18:17:07 GMT):<br/>
So we could say something like "Every versioned release of sawtooth has an accompanying distro which encompasses a set of packages compatible with that release, and this is what the code name refers to."
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 18:30:01 GMT):<br/>
you are retreading unwritten ground
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 18:33:13 GMT):<br/>
Okay, so does everyone already have the above in mind then?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 20:13:03 GMT):<br/>
Almost certainly not.

<p><strong>achenette</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 21:00:53 GMT):<br/>
Minus poet???
</p>
<p><strong>achenette</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 21:03:13 GMT):<br/>
The Sys Admin guide has steps to install Sawtooth software.  I'm changing the `add-apt-repository` step to include "`bumper`".  Do they need to get the poet software elsewhere?  
</p>

The Sys Admin guide has steps to install Sawtooth software.  I'm changing the `add-apt-repository` step to include `bumper`.  Will the sys admin need to get the poet software elsewhere?  (That is, in a separate step that references a different repo, package, or metapackage?)
</p>
<p><strong>achenette</strong> (Tue, 18 Sep 2018 21:04:18 GMT):<br/>
Similar question for actually installing the software.  Will `sudo apt-get install -y sawtooth` include the necessary stuff for a PoET consensus engine? 
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 12:57:12 GMT):<br/>
I think minus poet meant that the deb meta-package for sawtooth wouldn't include any consensus except devmode. Separately you would install poet with something like `apt-get install sawtooth-poet`.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 12:57:39 GMT):<br/>
Or similiarly `apt-get install sawtooth-raft`
</p>
<p><strong>rberg2</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 14:32:33 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 16:59:10 GMT):<br/>
I was discussing with @Dan and we thought good new features to call out 1) start of conversion to rust 2) highlight sabre 3) consensus engine redesign
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 16:59:50 GMT):<br/>
any thoughts on other things that would be worth calling out?
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 17:00:26 GMT):<br/>
and then i was thinking about maybe alluding to some potential updates in 1.2 which could include further rust, and consensus engines like raft/pbft/poet2-sgx
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 17:00:34 GMT):<br/>
open to feedback
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 17:02:54 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 17:47:10 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 19:17:44 GMT):<br/>
Does that mean that the current depdns in the ns-control file above are out of date? i.e. should we be expecting to see `python3-sawtooth-poet-engine` in that list somewhere?

<p><strong>rberg2</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 19:29:03 GMT):<br/>
hmm yeah that package should be in there. I can add that.
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 20:30:04 GMT):<br/>
@Dan should we create a `sawtooth-poet` meta package instead of adding poet-engine to the sawtooth meta package? And remove poet from the meta package?
</p>
<p><strong>achenette</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 20:42:19 GMT):<br/>
@adamludvik and @Dan - Does that imply that there might eventually be other metapackages like `sawtooth-raft`? And if someone wanted to install Sawtooth with their own consensus, would they create their own `sawtooth-MyConsensus` metapackage?
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 20:45:07 GMT):<br/>
The meta package pattern is just for convenience when there are many packages to install. With sawtooth-core and sawtooth-poet, this makes sense since there multiple packages that need to be installed to get a functional system. This is not a necessary pattern for consensus engines though, but there is nothing stopping the maintainers of that consensus package from doing so. For example, right now there is only one package for sawtooth-raft, so a meta package wouldn't make sense.
</p>
<p><strong>achenette</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 20:53:04 GMT):<br/>
It seems we're documenting the metapackage approach in the sys admin guide (and, presumably, in the app dev guide eventually).  I was hoping that the doc would be generic enough that people could use it as a model if they wanted to install a different consensus mechanism/algorithm.
</p>
<p><strong>achenette</strong> (Wed, 19 Sep 2018 20:59:11 GMT):<br/>
In other words, I'm hoping for a consistent approach for the metapackages that are under our control.

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 12:02:21 GMT):<br/>
I'm inclined to keep PoET in the sawtooth meta package for ease of use. Just one install command that way. If raft and eventually pbft are small then maybe just add those too.
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 14:35:05 GMT):<br/>
*sawtooth-mega package
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:17:46 GMT):<br/>
@Dan I'd rather not have to remove poet on every install
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:17:52 GMT):<br/>
:)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:21:21 GMT):<br/>
seriously though, the problem with removing things is it's not as trivial to cleanup the dependencies that get pulled in (all those python packages, etc.)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:22:36 GMT):<br/>
though, the same problem may exist with examples, at least those are all within the core repo
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:24:13 GMT):<br/>
Yeah I think it's cleaner with a smaller package but messier for writing install directions.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:24:48 GMT):<br/>
is "apt-get install -y sawtooth sawtooth-poet" messy?
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:27:19 GMT):<br/>
`apt-get instally -y sawtooth-core sawtooth-poet`?
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:27:48 GMT):<br/>
sawtooth-core => install everything in sawtooth-core?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:36:45 GMT):<br/>
seems ill-defined in that the definition of core keeps changing. like, if we split out the examples, would that list change?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:38:00 GMT):<br/>
if 'sawtooth' pulls in poet, raft, and pbft, it should also probably pull in sabre and seth. should it pull in supply chain, mktplace, and next directory? that would be "everything in the repo" quite literally
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:40:13 GMT):<br/>
we could do 'sawtooth' (default packages that are used in almost every install), 'sawtooth-all' or 'sawtooth-everything' (everything in the repo), sawtooth-poet, sawtooth-raft, sawtooth-pbft, sawtooth-sabre, all separately
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:41:46 GMT):<br/>
the most common combination for us going forward will probably be core, raft, and sabre
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:41:46 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:42:44 GMT):<br/>
(as pbft becomes stable, obviously)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:43:54 GMT):<br/>
though, we deploy using docker primarily too, so this is already an edge-case
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:46:59 GMT):<br/>
I think the "everything in core" definition is compelling because of its simplicity. Makes it much easier to decide what should go in it for everyone involved. I'm not sure that "core keeps changing" is a valid counterargument. I was under the impression we were mostly done with taking things out of core, but maybe this is not the case?
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 16:08:34 GMT):<br/>
I think given where the industry is today, I think ease of install is preferable to optimal/lean install
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 16:10:01 GMT):<br/>
e.g. optimize for the 100 people that may want to experiment with sawtooth vs the 20 core devs
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 16:37:37 GMT):<br/>
yeah i guess I'm fine with ```sudo apt-get install -y sawtooth sawtooth-poet```
</p>
<p><strong>achenette</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 17:15:28 GMT):<br/>
^ This works well for the docs.  It's easy for users to see how to change the command if they want different consensus software.
</p>

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 20:30:13 GMT):<br/>
so as a matter of process what would be a good way to share the LR data so that we aren't restricted to screenshot interpretation? the grafana site is publicly accessible btw, but this particular run was already stopped. @pankajgoyal has started a new run with the same bits and I've asked that run continue past 7 days if possible.
As far as another backport, that's probably fine. If we got it in tomorrow (maybe along with some necessary rustfmt change that boyd just posted) then we could still get in another LR7 before end of month.
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 20:53:42 GMT):<br/>
I prefer to look at the data on grafana myself if it is publicly available, because it gives you some tools for diving deeper on the data. In the past we have kept the data around for awhile after the run ended for people to review it posthumously.

For long term archiving, we could figure out how to export the data for a specific run out of influxdb so we can restore the view later.

@Dan @boydjohnson this PR is blocking releases and getting the memory leak fix backported. What needs to be done to resolve it? Looks like our options are 1. Merge it as is, possibly opening a new PR to peg lint version, 2. Add a new commit to peg the lint version, 3. Drop the PR and add a commit to peg to the pre-breaking lint version.

I started LR1 for Raft (1.1 release repo + Raft) on 27th Sept at 16:00Hrs approx (IST) . I setup the following raft consensus parameters:
sawtooth.consensus.raft.period=3000
sawtooth.consensus.raft.election_tick=20
sawtooth.consensus.raft.heartbeat_tick=2
Observation: After approx 15 hrs of run, I'm getting queue full on all rest end points. You can have a look at grafana at http://52.66.91.194:3000/d/dRHP9TDik/dashboard?orgId=1&from=now-18h&to=now&var-DATASOURCE=Raft_new . I'm also attaching the snapshot of grafana dashboard for your reference.

@pankajgoyal It looks like the network is still committing blocks though, is that correct? Seems like something is holding back the transaction throughput below whatever the workload rate is. What is the workload rate? What is the max block size? You could try increasing max block size and/or decreasing the raft period to increase throughput.
</p>
<p><strong>pankajgoyal</strong> (Mon, 01 Oct 2018 02:59:35 GMT):<br/>
@adamludvik I posted two grafana sessions above. For one of the sessions, the transactions are getting accepted only at Leader node's rest end point. The details for that are as below:

sawtooth.consensus.raft.heartbeat_tick=150
max_batches_per_block = 500

@adamludvik why is openssl installed in sawtooth-raft?  I cant find any place where it is actually used.
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Mon, 01 Oct 2018 23:29:17 GMT):<br/>
It is probably being pulled in with the rust sdk, which installs it.  
</p>
<p><strong>TomBarnes</strong> (Mon, 01 Oct 2018 23:30:40 GMT):<br/>
so it should be installed by the sawtooth SDK, not the raft build - correct?  
</p>
<p><strong>TomBarnes</strong> (Mon, 01 Oct 2018 23:30:47 GMT):<br/>
[dependencies]
clap = "2"
hex = "0.3"
log = "0.4"
log4rs = "0.8"
log4rs-syslog = "3.0"
protobuf = "2"
raft = "0.3.1"
sawtooth_sdk = { git = "https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core.git" }
serde_json = "1"
uluru = "0.2"
</p>
<p><strong>TomBarnes</strong> (Mon, 01 Oct 2018 23:30:59 GMT):<br/>
but instead it installs it explicitly
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 00:35:16 GMT):<br/>
Actually, it is more complicated than that. We are using openssl as a shared
library. The SDK is calling into that library through FFI. (Previously this was
done using a small C function I had written, but we are now using the full
openssl rust library bindings. The story is basically the same though). 

If you are getting the rust sdk through github or crates.io, then there isn't a
good way to have the SDK install it for you because it is a deb package in an
apt repo. If you were getting it through a deb package, then you could just
specify it as a dependency, but there is not good way to package Rust libraries
that aren't shared libraries as deb packages.

There is one last alternative, which is to vender openssl with the SDK, but there are separate licensing considerations there I think.

<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 16:05:01 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>TomBarnes</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 16:11:08 GMT):<br/>
@adamludvik thanks for the details on openssl - since Raft  clearly uses it, I will leave OpenSSL in the NOTICES file and corresponding documentation.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth-release?msg=r2Y6iwBSwyHha3fro) @adamludvik I just observed QUEUE_FULL in rest_api_debug.logs file

[2018-10-02 16:26:11.877 [MainThread] route_handlers DEBUG] Received CLIENT_BATCH_SUBMIT_RESPONSE response from validator with status QUEUE_FULL
[2018-10-02 16:26:11.878 [MainThread] helpers INFO] POST /batches HTTP/1.1: 429 status, 375 size, in 0.003290 s

</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 02 Oct 2018 17:01:11 GMT):<br/>
QUEUE_FULL indicates that the validator's batch queue is full. The limit is calculated based on the historical throughput of the network. This could indicate that for some reason, the validator is not able to process batches anymore. This is likely because of one of the following:
- Crashed/missing TP
- Crashed/missing consensus engine
- Internal validator problem
- No remaining system resources

You will need to look at the status and logs for each of those to determine the root cause.

<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 16:33:18 GMT):<br/>
@amundson in response to your comments on this PR about backwards compatibility and 1.1 https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/pull/1889, I have a few thoughts.

First, since we haven't actually released 1.1, I think this PR should be considered for backporting immediately.

Second, the Consensus API has not gone through any sort of stabilization and committing to backwards compatibility without an effort to stabilize the API implementation as we did with the TP API would be a mistake in my opinion. If there is a requirement that the Consensus API implementation be stabilized before the 1.1 release, then that is a big gap.

Third, without this change, BFT consensus algorithms that depend on signed message passing would not actually be BFT with 1.1, which seems like a significant loss. An example of such an algorithm would be PBFT. An example of an algorithm that is not affected by this is Raft.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 16:34:14 GMT):<br/>
I like the first, backporting
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 04 Oct 2018 16:35:22 GMT):<br/>
because we want to use pbft with 1.1

@ltseeley what kind of uptime are you getting with Raft? On bumper the LR tests are failing after ~15 hours (see a few posts above ^). 
Also can you copy @pankajgoyal on what settings you are using?
</p>
<p><strong>ltseeley</strong> (Tue, 09 Oct 2018 14:43:06 GMT):<br/>
@Dan @pankajgoyal it's been quite some time since I did more long-term testing of Raft; most of my testing involved shorter runs since we were more concerned with measuring performance. As far as settings for a 10 node network running 10TPS, I would recommend these settings:

sawtooth.consensus.raft.period=0
sawtooth.consensus.raft.election_tick=100
sawtooth.consensus.raft.heartbeat_tick=10
max_batches_per_block = 150

@pankajgoyal have you looked in the logs for anything out of the normal?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 21:21:37 GMT):<br/>
I looked at logs Pankaj saved from a run last week and there were no errors. I didn't find anything that jumped out. You could see backpressure kick in but I assume that was a consequence of the defect and not the source. The replica was dropping a fair amount of duplicate blocks but that seemed expected and unrelated.
The main observed failure was that the replicas stopped accepting transactions and only the leader was 'live'.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 22:29:00 GMT):<br/>
probably a good next step is to figure out how to repeat it outside of that environment (like in docker)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 16:23:56 GMT):<br/>
@Dan given the list of things to do yet prior to release, which we should be able to post here in some reasonable form on Monday, we are probably a couple weeks out for the release

@Dan re:PBFT/consensus API - I'd consider PBFT support (compatibility?) a blocker for 1.1, and I don't think we want to support two PBFT branches
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 17:04:36 GMT):<br/>
Not clear. the consensus API needs this https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/pull/1909 for PBFT.
If you are talking about the event pattern for communicating settings changes to a consensus engine, that's not even defined yet so I don't think we would want to hold up 1.1 for weeks / months.  
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 17:10:49 GMT):<br/>
well, maybe we say "PBFT needs to target core 1.1" and the question I'm asking is "do we need changes in 1.1 for that to be workable?"
</p>

@adamludvik ^
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 17:19:41 GMT):<br/>
My preference is to not break the consensus API once it is published on the 1.1 branch. I think that means we should have https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/pull/1909 merged before releasing 1.1. I do not believe the settings push-notifications would be a breaking change (I see it as more of an optimization), and I don't think it is required to make the PBFT implementation stable.

The following tasks are being undertaken to prepare for the Sawtooth 1.1 release:
-Identify & apply core backports (Shawn, Adam, Ryan, Anne, others) [1 week]
-Final LR7 testing (Pankaj) [1 week]
-Create release notes for 1.1 (Shawn, Adam, Andi, Ryan, Anne, others) [1 week]
-Website enhancements, automation (Ben, Shawn) [1-2 weeks]
-Official FAQ & Community page integrated into website (Ben, Dan A, Shawn) [2 days]
-Kubernetes updates (Richard) [3 days]
-Release Artifact builds, Tagging, Publishing (Ryan, Richard, Ken, Boyd, Shawn) [2 weeks]
-Release announcement (Kelly, maintainers) [1 week]
-Post-release blog entries (various topics and authors) [weekly]
-Coordination w/HL Marketing (Mark, Dan, Shawn, Kelly) [ongoing until release]
-Determine release date (root team: Adam, Andi, Dan, James, Kelly, Peter, Shawn, Tom) [ongoing until release]

At request of HL, release date will be discussed privately by the root team prior to announcement. Except for the date, everything else will be discussed in #sawtooth-release.

The activity durations are engineering estimates. Activities are expected to happen in parallel.

Let us know if there are any release preparation activities not listed in the items shown.

If I have some release notes text where should I drop that? (it's about poet and sgx in 1.1)
If I have some thoughts on the webpage where should I share that?
</p>
<p><strong>mfford</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 21:42:08 GMT):<br/>
For now, @Dan send release notes text to me, as I will be collecting them
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 24 Oct 2018 15:07:28 GMT):<br/>
@Dan if the website thoughts are deep, we can have a discussion about it in #sawtooth-outreach . if it's tactical (tasks to do before release), maybe here?

@amundson @Dan et. al, any thoughts on this comment in the backports PR:
> Note that I think we should also backport the change in 20e2265 as it fixes a known bug with the consensus API. However, this change depends on two components in the validator not being backported (block manager and fork cache) so I will need to rewrite part of the fix for 1-1.

</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 26 Oct 2018 18:51:27 GMT):<br/>
i think based on our branch point we are already pretty aggressive with backports. I'd rather see us get 1.1 out and then 1.2 before EOY than add more risk/time to 1.1. 
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 26 Oct 2018 20:01:38 GMT):<br/>
If you change your mind, here is the PR with more details. I'll let you and @amundson decide if we should include it.

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 14:33:03 GMT):<br/>
thanks!

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 14:49:42 GMT):<br/>
@Dan @adamludvik I think we should put in Adam's fix for that known bug before we start re-running LR testing, since we have to do the LR runs anyway.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 14:50:08 GMT):<br/>
so use the builds from the #1921?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 14:50:43 GMT):<br/>
for LR testing? I think we are going to spin some builds specifically for that once we get all the backporting done
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 14:51:21 GMT):<br/>
i.e. in the appropriate repos, not out of a jenkins PR. 
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 14:52:51 GMT):<br/>
ideally we make sure that we have everything in the repo that is consistent to test with (core, poet, etc.) so we know the release will be consistent
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 14:53:20 GMT):<br/>
Sure. If we want to start evaluating the blockmanager stuff today, though, then we should spin up an LR using the bits out of #1921?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 14:55:38 GMT):<br/>
the change in #1921 is not the block manager. it's a more targeted fix that is 1-1 specific because we didn't want to risk of backporting more
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 14:56:39 GMT):<br/>
to the question though, my hope is that those testable artifacts are not too far behind merging in these backport PRs, and that they would be available later in the day

<p><strong>rberg2</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 15:00:19 GMT):<br/>

@Dan @amundson one more backport I think we want in 1-1: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/pull/1924

This stabilizes the consensus p2p messaging API to something similar in spirit to https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-rfcs/pull/23 and is required for implementing this https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-rfcs/pull/30

</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 19:45:16 GMT):<br/>
@amundson @Dan If we decide we want all three of these PRs I suggest we close the first two and just merge the third. Merging them one at a time will require rebasing and waiting for Jenkins to rebuild but the result will be identical to merging just the last one.
 (https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/pull/1918, https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/pull/1921, https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/pull/1924)
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 20:03:43 GMT):<br/>
Or if we just want the first two, we just merge the second one.
</p>

@amundson @Dan still need you to approve this for merging: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/pull/1921

I recommend we merge that branch and start LR testing off of the result.
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 00:29:53 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/pull/1924 still needs a little work. Seems I missed a couple things in my haste to get it through. It is entirely API related and should have no effect on stability/performance for an LR run.

@amundson & @Dan - FYI, I'm doing a handful of quick doc changes to fix broken links and annoying errors.  I'd like to backport these changes to 1.1 so that the released docs are clean and all links work.  

Question: Should I backport each one individually as soon as it's merged into master? Or should I batch them into a single PR once I've finished my link-checking pass? 
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 19:45:21 GMT):<br/>
batch please
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 20:42:29 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Sun, 04 Nov 2018 20:44:45 GMT):<br/>
@pankajgoyal the missing core metrics (eg execution rate) suggest that your grafana setup is out of sync with the metric types the validators are reporting. Also, you should configure telegraf so you can report system metrics.

<p><strong>TomBarnes</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 17:46:47 GMT):<br/>
@achenette seems odd that rust SDK is shown as experimental in the SDK table when the whole of sawtooth is moving to rust
</p>
<p><strong>achenette</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 17:48:03 GMT):<br/>
That's a question for the people who determined the "status" of each SDK.  I recall that Shawn, Peter, Adam, and Dan were deeply invested in how to mark each SDK.  
</p>
<p><strong>achenette</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 17:48:21 GMT):<br/>
I made a change recently, and none of them said anything about changing the Rust status...

<p><strong>achenette</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 17:48:21 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>TomBarnes</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 17:50:20 GMT):<br/>
@amundson @Dan @pschwarz Is the SDK table in PR 1947 correct in showing rust SDK status as "experimental"?  We've moved a lot of code to rust this year so I was expecting that the Rust SDK would be one fo the best maintained and most up to date.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 17:57:31 GMT):<br/>
That's probably an outdated designation. 
</p>
<p><strong>achenette</strong> (Wed, 14 Nov 2018 18:20:03 GMT):<br/>
I'll need info (and agreement) on what corrections should be made. 
https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/app_developers_guide/sdk_table.html

For example, is the Rust SDK a 1 for client signing?  Transaction processor?  Can we check any other boxes, like Stable API or State Delta? 
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 16:02:23 GMT):<br/>
client signing and TP should be 1s
@pschwarz can you comment on rust sdk's state delta maturity?

yes, all 1s but not API stable. it wont' be API stable until we go through some form of review process, at which point we could make it 1.0.

To confirm: For Rust, the SDK table should change as follows:
- Change all three Maturity #s to 1
- Add checkmarks in all three  Complete columns (Client Signing, Transaction Processor, and State Delta)
- Leave the existing checkmark in the State Delta/Stable API column.
- Do not add checkmarks for Client Signing/Stable API and State Delta/Stable API.  

Is that correct, @amundson & @Dan & @pschwarz?

Please check out my proposed Rust changes for the SDK table in the following image.  If these changes look good, I'll create a PR with the goal of backporting it to 1.1.

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 18:00:27 GMT):<br/>
@amundson why aren't the other 2 APIs stable? Are there planned changes? Seemed like there were already a lot of new TPs and the old fundamental TPs ported to rust.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 18:01:44 GMT):<br/>
needs a final review which hasn't been done yet. after we do that, we will increment the rust sdk version to 1.0.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 18:05:16 GMT):<br/>
don't expect any radical changes between 0.1.x and 1.0.x and the existing TPs can/should use 0.1.x crate until they explicitly support 1.0
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 18:11:59 GMT):<br/>
for example, one discussion point on that will be whether we would like to purge the use of Box in parts of the API and take the approach Ursa has taken (strong opinions were stated against this, but its worth the discussion before we lock it down)
</p>
<p><strong>achenette</strong> (Wed, 28 Nov 2018 16:01:48 GMT):<br/>
The updated SDK table is in PR 1953. It's not building because of a lint problem (not a doc issue), but it's available for review.

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 17:11:24 GMT):<br/>
We would like to make it possible to request doing a release. This came up because Anne has some doc commits in the 1-1 branch that haven't been released yet, and its caused some frustration.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 17:14:09 GMT):<br/>
So, what we are planning to do is watch this channel on Tuesdays for requests for a release of a component. If a reasonable case has been made to do a release of that component, then we will do the release on Thursday. This lets the folks doing the release expect some level of potential work on Thursdays, and gives everyone the ability to request it.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 17:14:52 GMT):<br/>
This is, of course, for minor point releases. There remains much more governance overhead for X.Y releases.
</p>
<p><strong>agunde</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 17:16:43 GMT):<br/>
Is there a requirement that the changes are already back-ported (merged into the correct branch) before making the request? For example how Anne's Doc updates are already in the 1-1 branch?  
</p>
<p><strong>agunde</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 17:17:00 GMT):<br/>
(I would assume so but clarifying)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 17:17:12 GMT):<br/>
Yes, that seems like a good requirement to me. And also, no breaking things between tuesday and thursday.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 17:19:07 GMT):<br/>
We should do this all pragmatically and not get caught up in the rules unless they matter. And adjust it if we learn this wasn't the best approach.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 17:20:26 GMT):<br/>
Also, this is always per-component and not "release everything", since only so much time will be available to do these things on Thursdays.

<p><strong>boydjohnson</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 19:03:43 GMT):<br/>
@pschwarz That logger bug fix that is in master should be backported to 1-1.
</p>
<p><strong>achenette</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 19:33:54 GMT):<br/>
Should that be done for the next release? Andi and Shawn mentioned above that PRs should already be backported by Tuesday in order to be considered for release on Thursday.

</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 19:54:12 GMT):<br/>
@boydjohnson let's get that backported on Friday, and it can get into next week's release
</p>
<p><strong>boydjohnson</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 19:55:12 GMT):<br/>
Only half the code correctly logs without this fix.
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 19:57:19 GMT):<br/>
But it would be good to have it tested in 1-1, in case that fix doesn't address all of 1-1's issues w.r.t. logging
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 19:59:03 GMT):<br/>
It wasn't broken in master, so there could be another reason
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 19:59:29 GMT):<br/>
yeah, that change fixed some segfault stuff in 1-1 right?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 19:59:37 GMT):<br/>
maybe "fixed" if it wasn't actually the cause
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 20:00:26 GMT):<br/>
The original fix in 1-1 fixed some segfault stuff
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 20:01:37 GMT):<br/>
The master fix addressed an observed issue where the code would panic.  I don't know if they are related, now that you describe it as a segfault issue. 
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 20:02:03 GMT):<br/>
maybe it was panic. @boydjohnson do you recall?
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 20:02:04 GMT):<br/>
So I think it needs some more time to be tested against the 1-1 codebase
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 20:03:06 GMT):<br/>
That seems fine to me. We should err on the side of not introducing regressions.
</p>
<p><strong>boydjohnson</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 20:04:04 GMT):<br/>
I don't recall whether the 1-1 original fix was a panic or a segfault. It wasn't clean, whatever it was.
</p>
<p><strong>boydjohnson</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 20:04:39 GMT):<br/>
Thinking back about it the second init of the logger caused a panic.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 20:04:42 GMT):<br/>
now you can test how good your commit messages are :)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 20:05:59 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/commit/81121bac2572fc90001b7dda8b74e88c3cf24ceb
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 20:06:06 GMT):<br/>
It almost tells us :)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 20:06:57 GMT):<br/>
so, if its a panic it should be easy to test, but don't we expect the same result we got before?
</p>
<p><strong>boydjohnson</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 20:08:20 GMT):<br/>
Just a second. I'm going to look at @pschwarz fix to see if it is just a revert.
</p>
<p><strong>boydjohnson</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 20:09:28 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/commit/c2e5e2b69b41f798179ce8e630e19d7e5fe8392c This is the fix that we need, as well as the revert.
</p>
<p><strong>boydjohnson</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 20:10:02 GMT):<br/>
Peter's message is more thorough than mine.
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 20:14:11 GMT):<br/>
It does explain why we won't get the same result
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 20:14:20 GMT):<br/>
if it was panicking 
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 20:14:46 GMT):<br/>
Which, guessing by Boyd's message, it probably was
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Tue, 29 Jan 2019 22:18:35 GMT):<br/>
@boydjohnson If it hasn't fixed it, was it a failure that appeared during the tests?
</p>
<p><strong>boydjohnson</strong> (Wed, 30 Jan 2019 21:28:22 GMT):<br/>
I was apparent in all integration tests that used the validator, since the validator would panic on startup.
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Wed, 30 Jan 2019 21:29:34 GMT):<br/>
Ok.  Will create a backport PR for it, but it probably won't get in until next week
</p>

Ok.

<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Thu, 07 Feb 2019 16:30:02 GMT):<br/>

[?]: We are planning to have next dot release of Raft consensus. So far we are using nightly (bionic) branch of sawtooth-core to test Raft. So, we want to ask if there is a tagged bionic branch of sawtooth-core nightly which we can use now and perform Raft release activities.

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 18 Feb 2019 14:53:24 GMT):<br/>
@pankajgoyal there are no 1.2.x core releases yet. the intent would be that poet, pbft, and raft all have to support both 1.1 and master. so you should to test against 1.1 as well.
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 09:27:15 GMT):<br/>
@amundson agreed. The question was whether there is a branch for bionic we can peg our release activities to. The master is a moving target. Is it OK to tag the master?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 14:25:11 GMT):<br/>
@amolk my impression is that poet+core master has issues passing liveness tests. I don't think we would want to do a release of core while that remains the case (tag == release).
</p>
<p><strong>manojgop</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 06:07:23 GMT):<br/>
@amundson Is the release of core dependent/blocked on sawtooth-poet ? Can we have a sawtooth-core release for bionic which will work with PBFT and RAFT ?
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 10:02:54 GMT):<br/>
@amundson Could you please share more info on what's the issue w/ PoET? AFAIK it hasn't changed in a while. The last meaningful changes were in December, before the 1.1 release.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 14:39:37 GMT):<br/>
@amolk I don't think root cause is known yet, but its an interaction between PoET and core master. It could be a bug in master.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 14:40:18 GMT):<br/>
It is informative though if your RAFT testing is against core master and it is stable.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 14:41:07 GMT):<br/>
@ltseeley @rbuysse @pschwarz do you guys have any more commentary on this that would help describe the issue?
</p>
<p><strong>ltseeley</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 15:10:43 GMT):<br/>
From what I've been able to tell (and @pschwarz may be able to clarify some of the finer points), it seems that the issue is caused by changes to the way the validator manages blocks. There are certain scenarios that occur with PoET that the validator didn't have a problem with before, but now it takes exception to. We aren't totally sure yet if it's the validator that's incorrect or PoET (or quite possibly a bit of both).
</p>
<p><strong>ltseeley</strong> (Wed, 20 Feb 2019 15:12:51 GMT):<br/>
Specifically, it seems like an issue with the fork resolution and how the validator keeps track of references to blocks. That's why we're seeing issues with PoET and not the non-forking algorithms Raft and PBFT.

<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Sun, 24 Feb 2019 09:38:02 GMT):<br/>
@ltseeley do you have any plans to fix the PoET issue? It seems like a significant change to the validator behavior.

<p><strong>pankajgoyal</strong> (Mon, 11 Mar 2019 17:45:39 GMT):<br/>
@amundson @rberg2 We have been testing sawtooth-raft against sawtooth-core master branch (hash: 0cf2e8c0cd908e68cf1453c8160468736a1323aa). Can a tag be placed at this hash of master branch which will be the reference of sawtooth-core for raft release?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 11 Mar 2019 21:42:41 GMT):<br/>
@pankajgoyal the consensus engines shouldn't depend on a specific version of the core repo right? if you want to test against a stable version, why not use 1.1.x?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 11 Mar 2019 21:44:07 GMT):<br/>
a release of core right now needs more discussion, because PoET tests fail against it
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 11 Mar 2019 21:44:55 GMT):<br/>
I think we either make a decision to fully deprecate PoET (which seems unlikely) or we hold the release until everything is working together again
</p>
<p><strong>pankajgoyal</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 04:12:51 GMT):<br/>
@amundson There is an important patch that is needed for raft. This is PR from seeley (https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/pull/2019). And this patch is on top of sawtooth-core master (0cf2e8c0cd908e68cf1453c8160468736a1323aa). And we have been testing raft by applying seeley's patch on top of this master hash. So, we want a TAG on this master hash without worrying about any further changes that keep coming into master branch. And yes, we are testing raft against 1.1.x also.
</p>
<p><strong>HarshaIntel</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 04:17:28 GMT):<br/>
@amundson This patch disables the gossip n/w and it s proven to work for long hours (LR runs) without backpressure, hence this patch is needed to be taken on top of teh master shared above.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 04:46:19 GMT):<br/>
@HarshaIntel back pressure is good. the only way to avoid back pressure is to have a really low workload, which means the test isn’t stressing the network. glad this patch helps. curious if you also get stable results if you load the network with a workload just above what it can handle.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 04:48:38 GMT):<br/>
@pankajgoyal are you saying raft is not stable against 1.1? I believe pbft is, and I would expect raft could be as well.
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 04:51:22 GMT):<br/>
It is stable on 1.1 but performs better with the patch. Would request you to merge it and backport to 1.1
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 04:52:25 GMT):<br/>
It seems possible that this patch helps raft because it makes it less likely to trigger performance/timing bugs, and for solely functional reasons. thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 04:55:26 GMT):<br/>
in terms of tags, we only do them for releases (our versioning code would be potentially sensitive to arbitrary tags), which is why I am interpreting your tag request as a request for a release. And like I said before, releasing while poet tests are failing seems like the wrong path forward.
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 04:59:41 GMT):<br/>
We just need a fixed point of reference to run our final Raft validation and point anyone interested in running Raft on Bionic. If a tag isn't the right way to go about it, we'll be happy to have some other point of reference. BTW, there's a 1.2 tag that seems to have been created back in September :)
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 05:04:07 GMT):<br/>
And you're right about the patch. It makes the processing of consensus messages a bit more efficient and reduces some of the timing dependent issues we see under heavy loads. The right long term solution would be to eliminate the GIL related bottlenecks on queue processing.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 05:14:43 GMT):<br/>
@amolk that bottleneck comment is inconsistent with all the performance data I have seen in the past (which suggested a primary bottleneck in the predecessor tree). if you have data that shows something different, that would be good info for #sawtooth-core-dev. the use of python is going away, and so thus will the GIL. the transact library should address both the GIL and predecessor tree performance when we get to using it later in the year.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 05:17:11 GMT):<br/>
you should only test under heavy loads if thats what exposes the raft bugs. assuming you want to get to a stable raft release.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 05:18:54 GMT):<br/>
@amolk do you mean literally only raft on bionic as in a docker container, or do you mean sawtooth?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 05:24:07 GMT):<br/>
the 1.2.0 tag exists at the branch point; it is an artifact of the branching and versioning process.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 05:24:47 GMT):<br/>
backporting isn’t going to help w/bionic
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 18:20:51 GMT):<br/>
@amolk I'd like to start considering a feature cut-off date for 1.2 so we can start to do testing. Do you have a sense for how long the remaining features desired for 1.2 that have RFCs in-progress for will take to implement?
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Mon, 18 Mar 2019 09:23:35 GMT):<br/>
@amundson Raft is mostly done. We'll restart work on PoET 2 once Raft is done and aim to be ready later in Q2.
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Mon, 18 Mar 2019 09:25:48 GMT):<br/>
regarding your earlier comment, backporting that PR would help with Raft on 1.1. That's separate from the Bionic requirement.
</p>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth-release?msg=xEY5HFBizlRnOVbD3s) @amundson Could you give some more details on "transact library" ?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 18 Mar 2019 14:06:08 GMT):<br/>
@manojgop basically, a rust re-implementation of the tep within sawtooth (schedulers, context management, execution, and state)
</p>
<p><strong>manojgop</strong> (Mon, 18 Mar 2019 15:43:59 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @amundson . Could you please clarify what is predecessor tree and what is the bottleneck there ?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 18 Mar 2019 16:00:16 GMT):<br/>
@manojgop the predecessor tree is a component of the parallel scheduler which helps determine implicit dependencies between transactions. the bottleneck is CPU.
</p>
<p><strong>manojgop</strong> (Mon, 18 Mar 2019 16:09:08 GMT):<br/>
@amundson So if I understand correctly, Rust implementation will make sawtooth core multi threaded and performance can improve on multi core CPUs.  That's very encouraging if we can make Sawtooth performance (in terms of TPS) competitive with other ledgers for various workloads
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 18 Mar 2019 16:24:17 GMT):<br/>
@manojgop we are already competitive in apples-to-apples comparisons, AFAIK. but yeah, it is going to be a substantial performance increase.

The convention we've used is to only include the major.minor version, not the .patch number. But whatever the engine reports its version as, that's what the setting has to match. Here's where Raft's is set: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-raft/blob/master/src/engine.rs#L110

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 26 Apr 2019 17:08:19 GMT):<br/>
FYI - @wkatsak mentioned adding ipv6 support prior to the 1.2 release

<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Fri, 26 Apr 2019 17:54:49 GMT):<br/>
@ltseeley Thanks. The Raft documentation stays to use version `0.0.1`. Or It used to say that--now it says to use the current version but now that is (unhelpfully) removed. It would be nice, at least, to have a link to the source code or some obscure command line syntax so the user can somehow discover what version to use. :slight_smile:
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 26 Apr 2019 17:55:08 GMT):<br/>
specifically, the sawtooth.consensus.algorithm.version setting is the _protocol_ level and has nothing to do really with software version conceptually
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 26 Apr 2019 19:28:56 GMT):<br/>
a critical bug fix might be conceptually a protocol version change in that you don't want people attaching broken nodes to the network even if the wireline is the same.
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Mon, 29 Apr 2019 14:30:00 GMT):<br/>
That sounds like it would be effectively a behaviour change, so sounds reasonable to bump the version presented to the validator, via settings

Hello, as @amundson mentioned, I (and Taekion) have a patchset for 1.1 that enables running Sawtooth on IPv6 networks.  We are in the process of "smoothing out" the patches and validating it on master.
</p>
<p><strong>wkatsak</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 12:03:16 GMT):<br/>
What is the timeframe for getting it into 1.2, and what type of testing would you like to see? It essentially consists of a zmq flag, and other small changes (rest api, etc) to correct assumptions that only work for ipv4 addresses.
</p>
<p><strong>wkatsak</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 12:03:49 GMT):<br/>
We have a testnet that ONLY has ipv6 connectivity (but has local ipv4 stack for localhost, etc), so this was the motivation.

@wkatsak Would you mind creating a JIRA ticket for your patchset for enablement of Sawtooth on IPV6? We are tracking items intended for version 1.2 together on Jira for Sawtooth. In addition to the instructions for "Tracking Issues" in the community doc, also create it as issue type= improvement, indicate Sawtooth Version 1.2 in the "Fix Version/s" field and assign it to yourself. If you need help, you can DM me directly. Here is the link: https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/community/issue_tracking.html
</p>
<p><strong>wkatsak</strong> (Thu, 02 May 2019 14:25:07 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 15:28:15 GMT):<br/>
Intel has an internally hosted regression test environment. They would like to help validate the 1.2 candidate (extended regression tests, LR testing of all 3 consensus protocols). Probably the minimal coordination is just awareness of the 1.2 branch point. @amolk on point for that.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 15:36:48 GMT):<br/>
@amundson remind me the of the code name nomenclature.. are code names for major releases or minor releases?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 16:14:10 GMT):<br/>
@Dan code names are for project-level releases. Sawtooh 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 16:16:38 GMT):<br/>
So in terms of semver that would be minor versions (and implicitly major versions).
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 16:20:13 GMT):<br/>
two separate things - version numbers on components (very semver, have minor versions, etc.) and project-level releases which are essentially sawtooth distributions
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 16:20:13 GMT):<br/>
two separate things - version numbers on components (very semver, have X.Y.Z versions, etc.) and project-level releases which are essentially sawtooth distributions
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 16:50:00 GMT):<br/>
So a tangible aspect of that distinction is that if I were to pull apt packages for any sawtooth component, I would pull from a unified repo for that distribution e.g. ubuntu/multiball/
Which itself could include python3-sawtooth-poet-cli 1.45.2 and python3-sawtooth-intkey 27.1.2
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 17:55:09 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 17:56:10 GMT):<br/>
in fact, many of the components will be the same version between bumper and chime

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 14:42:32 GMT):<br/>
@amolk I've not been watching Jira as frequently as I used to. I need to get back on that. Good for others to be engaged there too.
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 14:42:54 GMT):<br/>
Agree
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Mon, 10 Jun 2019 15:58:00 GMT):<br/>
@amolk do you have any LR testing plans or thoughts on communicating results/analysis to share?
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 07:00:59 GMT):<br/>
Regression tests have been run on PBFT. LR1 tests have started on PoET, PBFT and Raft. LR7 tests will start later this week or early next. We will provide regular updates on the results here on this channel.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 15:45:31 GMT):<br/>
@amolk great you are testing too
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 15:45:51 GMT):<br/>
what specifically do you mean by "Regression tests have been run on PBFT."?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 15:47:38 GMT):<br/>
In general, PBFT is very well-tested at this point and passes LR7s. We maybe see a slow increase in memory usage over time, but we think it is more pronounced in 1.2 because we Sawtooth+PBFT is faster.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 15:48:46 GMT):<br/>
AFAIK, Raft may not pass the same level of testing under load, but it does not matter for the upcoming release of Sawtooth because we aren't planning on making any claims about Raft stability.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 15:50:26 GMT):<br/>
PoET on the other hand... it needs more LR7 testing for sure, and work to fix some apparent issues with poet-engine. Nodes drop out of the network.
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:08:53 GMT):<br/>
@amundson We have a test suite that's meant to exercise Sawtooth via the REST interface. By and large most test cases are applicable across the board and not dependent on the consensus mechanism. The outcome of some of the tests depends on the consensus being used (e.g. a RAFT follower may keep an invalid transaction in queue and not return a transaction failure unlike a PoET validator). We've used this test suite for the 1.1 release, for Raft and now for PBFT on the 1.2 branch. The only findings to note are that for some malformed messages trying to read state, the client gets back an 'Internal Server Error' instead of a meaningful return code. These are not new and we've classified them as low severity.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:12:30 GMT):<br/>
@amolk have you entered tasks in JIRA for them, or do you mean internally?

STL-1371, although now that I look at it, the description needs to be meaningful
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:24:52 GMT):<br/>
RAFT and PBFT are stable so far 12+ hours into the LR1. Both are on 10 node networks.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:25:16 GMT):<br/>
@amolk what load?
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:25:32 GMT):<br/>
Nominal load of 10TPS
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:25:40 GMT):<br/>
that's not high enough IMO
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:26:29 GMT):<br/>
but, like I said, we did PBFT under the max load it can handle. it's good. but I think that low load is why Raft is succeeding?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:27:02 GMT):<br/>
the load should be set right below what it's capable of processing on the given hardware configuration (all the bugs seem to come out then)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:27:29 GMT):<br/>
(but again, I'm less worried about Raft passing)
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:28:16 GMT):<br/>
We'll keep increasing the load in subsequent runs. We're running PBFT for the first time and haven't run Raft in a while so not sure how any validator changes might affect it.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:28:17 GMT):<br/>
for PoET, maybe at least do 20TPS? can you replicate problems with it at 10TPS?
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:29:33 GMT):<br/>
We're seeing some intermittent failures in summarize block for PoET. Had seen them in Raft as well long ago.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:29:37 GMT):<br/>
what workload generator are you using? intkey?
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:30:08 GMT):<br/>
intkey mainly. On another test network we're using intkey+smallbank
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:30:12 GMT):<br/>
increasing the load might help the failures come out faster
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:31:17 GMT):<br/>
I'm curious if there is a difference between 1.1 and 1.2 in this respect
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:32:21 GMT):<br/>
some of our comparison testing between 1.1 and 1.2 wsn't possible as 1.1 can't handle the same level of testing as we are now doing in 1.2
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:32:43 GMT):<br/>
but I'm not sure that comparison has been done w/PoET engine
</p>
<p><strong>rranjan3</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 16:35:16 GMT):<br/>
Have witnessed the FutureTimeoutError on summarize call (@Amol pointed) in 1.1.5. Yet to verify on latest(1.2).

<p><strong>ltseeley</strong> (Fri, 28 Jun 2019 13:16:18 GMT):<br/>
Backpressure is usually symptom of something else going wrong; the node can't commit blocks/batches for some reason. Can you check the PBFT logs to see what happened around that time? Also, are there any errors in the validator?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 28 Jun 2019 14:20:34 GMT):<br/>
I'm curious if the validator was restarted there

<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Fri, 28 Jun 2019 21:33:35 GMT):<br/>
Validator wasn't restarted. Attaching logs for the validator that fell out of sync. Look from Block number 15400. 
</p>
<p><strong>ltseeley</strong> (Mon, 01 Jul 2019 17:16:34 GMT):<br/>
It starts failing all blocks starting at block 15293. Can you see why PBFT failed block 15293?

Hi, any news of sawtooth 1.2? When will it be released?
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 06:07:03 GMT):<br/>
Soon :relaxed: 
</p>
<p><strong>RealDeanZhao</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 06:08:56 GMT):<br/>
:grinning: 
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 15:51:41 GMT):<br/>
@RealDeanZhao the release is blocked on a regression which shows up during PoET long-running network testing (PBFT runs do not exhibit the same issue). once that's resolved, it should not take long for the release to be official.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 16:42:33 GMT):<br/>
There are interesting observations with 1.2 release candidate
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 16:43:55 GMT):<br/>
1. We observe a KeyError issue (a side effect of validator sending duplicate block to consensus engine) in validator version 1.2 but not on latest master build or earlier 1.1 validator
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 16:44:34 GMT):<br/>
2. There are too many forks on 1.2 when compared to 1.1, with same PoET binary
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 16:59:27 GMT):<br/>
I want to make sure we are aligned on what build is being tested. It looks like we've continued to have doc backports but the last coding change is ~June 28. https://build.sawtooth.me/job/Sawtooth-Hyperledger/job/sawtooth-core/job/1-2/changes
@arsulegai do you know which build your LR is executing?
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 18:19:00 GMT):<br/>
I will take a step back here before commenting more. However as pasted in #sawtooth-core-dev along with logs, the KeyError issue logs I have is for validator version 1.3.1-dev12-dirty
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 18:30:22 GMT):<br/>
1.3.1 sounds like master
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 18:30:58 GMT):<br/>
1.2: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/blob/1-2/VERSION
master: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/blob/master/VERSION
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Wed, 10 Jul 2019 18:54:25 GMT):<br/>
There's one more log with version version 1.2.1-dev615-dirty which has seen the KeyError issue
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 08:22:24 GMT):<br/>
Ok, now I am confident on receiving the duplicate block from validator. It's seen in yesterday's nightly 1.2 build as well
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:24:46 GMT):<br/>
I created an issue in Jira to track it https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/STL-1664
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 03:17:34 GMT):<br/>
Clarification on point 1 of my earlier message. The validator sends duplicate block on latest master as well, just that it didn't end up in KeyError issue. It's however messing up the state machine in the PoET. https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-poet/pull/38 handles and solves the issue because of validator's changed behavior.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 03:22:57 GMT):<br/>
Clarification on point 2: We found a suitable configuration settings for the 10 node network to run smoothly.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 12 Jul 2019 19:22:38 GMT):<br/>
Reviewed and merged #38. I guess we need to backport that to 1-2.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Sat, 13 Jul 2019 05:40:45 GMT):<br/>
1-1, 1-2, master all share the same PoET and this change has no effect on 1-1. With earlier versions of Sawtooth, this issue doesn't occur at Validator. However doesn't harm to backport to 1.0, shall I?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Sun, 14 Jul 2019 15:55:32 GMT):<br/>
oh I don't know what I was thinking. no need to backport.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Sun, 14 Jul 2019 15:56:41 GMT):<br/>
Are we all set now for Chime / 1.2 with PoET LR success or is there still some regression to be resolved?
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 11:23:13 GMT):<br/>
PoET-SGX shows stability at 10tps
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 15:35:45 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 15:46:56 GMT):<br/>
LR1 completed
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 15:47:11 GMT):<br/>
(with the pending patches in sawtooth-poet repository)
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 16 Jul 2019 14:17:11 GMT):<br/>
@arsulegai reports that the LR testing is looking good. We have one PR in sawtooth-poet that needs a tweak and then that is the last thing on my end that is holding up `chime`.

Hi, any update on when the next version of the Java SDK for Sawtooth planned for release? The new version has support for two important features - deleting an address and application-specific events.
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 09:26:43 GMT):<br/>
@VishalBatra The SDK should appear with the rest of the Sawtooth release
</p>
<p><strong>VishalBatra</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 09:41:19 GMT):<br/>
Ok, thank you very much. Is there a tentative date planned for this release?
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 09:51:11 GMT):<br/>
August 13 was the earlier planned date, but now it's postponed by 2 weeks.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 14:25:20 GMT):<br/>
(a minimum of 2 weeks, we haven't picked a new date yet)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 14:27:39 GMT):<br/>
but, the SDK point releases are actually independent of the overall release. @rberg2 ^ java sdk release request
</p>
<p><strong>rberg2</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 18:16:32 GMT):<br/>
Hello, I did a release of the java sdk version 0.1.3 on Jun 28 2019. I do not see any code changes since that release. Is anything missing from 0.1.3 that you expect to be there?
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 09:27:00 GMT):<br/>
@VishalBatra ^
</p>
<p><strong>LeonardoCarvalho</strong> (Sat, 10 Aug 2019 17:10:24 GMT):<br/>
I see the tag v0.1.3, withe the VERSION bumped to 0.1.3, but the POM and Readme showing v0.1.2 ,,,
</p>
<p><strong>rberg2</strong> (Mon, 12 Aug 2019 14:16:38 GMT):<br/>
I believe the POM is changed with the command `mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=v0.1.3` during release
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 12 Aug 2019 15:18:08 GMT):<br/>
Still, the versions should be kept in sync. To match what we do everywhere else, the version in the repo at HEAD should be the next version (the one not yet released).
</p>
<p><strong>rberg2</strong> (Mon, 12 Aug 2019 16:07:20 GMT):<br/>
kk I made a note in the release docs to do that. looking at one of the released pom files it did get updated during release, so I don't think that's a problem. https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/hyperledger/sawtooth/sawtooth-sdk-protos/v0.1.3/sawtooth-sdk-protos-v0.1.3.pom

It tries for some time and then throws network error. I tried to create Jenkins server on 2 different machines and both have the same behaviour. Any leads will be appreciated.
