{"msg":"Hi everyone, I have a question regarding of how to design an application on Sawtooth:\n\t- Firstly, as I see in provided examples from Sawtooth, the only methods implemented inside Transaction Processors are Update/Create actions, like Create Account, Deposit, ….\n\t\t-> By then, I see in Sawtooth, Transaction Processor only keep responsibility of Writing data into blockchain. Other actions like get, query business data will be up to Client responsibility, via RestAPI, with query functions on State. And Client will query and parse raw data in State to extract business data. Is it true?\n\t\t-> If yes, should we have a solution for reading business data by rules defined inside Transaction Processor, as in normal Ethereum smart contract, which have both Get and Create/Update methods inside a Smart Contract, which we can define rules of reading data.\n\n\t- Secondly, I would like to ask for how should we design to apply permission schemas into get/query data in Sawtooth? As you can see in privacy meaning, Only user have right of reading data of his/her state on Blockchain. User A cannot read and query data of user B\n\n\t- Lastly, as above question, I want to ask for a way of better query data without needs of parsing raw business data on State. I would like to have a way to allow Client query data by logic defined on Transaction Processor. I see it possible to update Sawtooth to allow that, but I want to ask for any impaction and intension of Sawtooth developer why we don’t add that into Sawtooth.

{"msg":"That's interesting discussion and sorry I'm late commenting on this, the PR from @knkski is similar to what I expected would be present. I faced so many issues when writing my first application (especially the client which I wrote in Go), it wasn't as easy as sawtooth document made it look like.\n\nHere's my wish list which could help\n\n1. Header ID is sign of serialised header (similar idea for both transaction/batch). A builder concept here would help.\nExample:\ntransaction = Transaction.builder().signing_key(/*accepts key*/).header(/*accepts transaction header object*/)....build();\nHaving such utility will avoid developer errors and provide a default means of constructing transaction and batches.\n\n2. Sawtooth (under transactions and batches) document mentions that headers are to be serialized and developers should be careful when performing serialize/de-serialize operation as it should be consistent across languages. As a first time developer, I was worried with these instructions (have a question as well here, why should it be mentioned when we're using Protobuf to perform these operations). I guess document is influenced by Python language.\nIt would help if somewhere it's also mentioned to make use of Protobuf libraries for serialize/de-serialize operation (infact just highlight this part). In case of Go, Protobuf library has to be explicitly called by passing reference of constructed header, it wasn't mentioned anywhere.\n\nI wish for these because there wasn't a way to know which step in my transaction composition has gone wrong. Validator just responds that sent batch list cannot be de-serialized. It was painful to debug !! :(","username":"arsulegai","ts":"2018-10-10T02:03:52.250Z"}

{"msg":"@LeonardoCarvalho to expand on that - all the nodes in the network use consensus to agree on the current block (called HEAD). they use one of the consensus algorithms to do this (PoET, PBFT, Raft, etc.). Part of that is verifying the block. Each block has a merkle root of state (a hash of state essentially) that each node recreates. The process of recreating that state involves running every transaction (in order as it appears in the block). The actual execution of those transactions is scheduled either using the parallel scheduler or the serial scheduler -- but the result is the same (the parallel scheduler is designed to give the same results as the serial scheduler, only faster). Thus, all nodes need all the relevant transaction processors since they are all verifying and recreating state by running through the transactions.","username":"amundson","ts":"2018-10-31T14:59:26.052Z"}

Merely transorting strucured data does not encourage use by larger companies who need to be involved int he project.

What happens if you tell corporate lawyers (I have gone through this at ADP & IBM) that you will use a project from one source, and a piece (in this case an SDK) from another source, you have a headache to be approved, even if its just your tech manager.  Much better to get from a single source.  So I would advote as @arsulegai that we should have the top 2-3 languages in the SDK.
