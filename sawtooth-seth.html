Do we know/expect that the burrow transaction processor will be stateless? I saw some error handling code that referenced consensus. Does there need to be any interaction between consensus and the transaction processor? 
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 08 May 2017 17:21:38 GMT):<br/>
@boydjohnson this is a first cut. the purpose of this branch is to refine the API of Burrow's EVM as we go so that it is stateless and not integrated tightly with other burrow components.  After we go through this exercise, what we learn will be used to update the Burrow itself (which lives int the hyperledger burrow repository).
</p>
<p><strong>boydjohnson</strong> (Mon, 08 May 2017 17:22:08 GMT):<br/>
Cool. Sounds good.

The only reason I haven't merged this yet, is that there was an on-going discussion between @benjaminbollen and myself on whether we should move 'borrow' up a level so it's a the same height as sawtooth_burrow_evm, instead of under it.

Hello @dennismckinnon! Looking forward to working with you.
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 22:06:25 GMT):<br/>
Thanks I'm looking forward to working with all of you too! So far I love what you have put together I think you are really on the ball. The only suggestion so far is for allowing transaction processors to produce events and pipe those out somewhere.
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 22:06:55 GMT):<br/>
I was introducing a co-worker to sawtooth today and one question did come up
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 22:07:16 GMT):<br/>
why when running through the tutorial does there not seem to be blocks continuously produced
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 22:07:38 GMT):<br/>
Is it not using PoET?
</p>
<p><strong>boydjohnson</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 22:15:49 GMT):<br/>
I don't think our tutorials have examples of using PoET. I am not entirely sure, but I think that our validator won't publish blocks if not given batches, no matter the consensus algorithm.
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 09 May 2017 22:58:14 GMT):<br/>
Really? That seems odd... If consensus like PoET uses largest elasped time to determine the correct fork don't you still need to create empty blocks for registering that time onto the correct chain? otherwise wouldn't it be super easy to overtake? Maybe that intuition is wrong. I have been focused mostly on the transaction processor side and not so much on the consensus side. It just seemed curious to me.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 02:24:17 GMT):<br/>
Default consensus is devmode which won't publish an empty block.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 02:25:46 GMT):<br/>
What would be some example events? Generic like log messages or with some structure?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 02:26:44 GMT):<br/>
We are currently designing the stats system which might be similar.
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 12:34:36 GMT):<br/>
Well the evm and solidity allows for events to be triggered by the smart contract
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 12:35:31 GMT):<br/>
These are massively useful in many applications from notifying interested parties that something important has happened to triggering cache updates
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 12:37:39 GMT):<br/>
the solidity events structure is normally pretty simple containing some data about the block they occurred on and some other information that allows you to find the contract it came from along with some data you can attach from the contract
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 12:39:20 GMT):<br/>
@benjaminbollen probably could give more information about their current implementation
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 12:40:38 GMT):<br/>
I think they are pushed into the log right now
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Wed, 10 May 2017 12:40:47 GMT):<br/>
from EVM, they would be both `LOG` opcode executions and errors that we d want to deal with (additionally trace messages from the EVM itself)

Thanks again for everyone who was able to attend the call.

I do not catch very well the way of the integration burrow-STL.
a) As other kind of family with own language of Smart Contract but using the STL-Validator,
b) or only to interconection of Burrow to the POET -STL-Consensus
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 12:07:31 GMT):<br/>
indeed, a. to objective is to have a transaction family in sawtooth that executes Ethereum code

<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 12:09:24 GMT):<br/>
@adamludvik although the data in leaf nodes is opaque to the validator core, what serialisation protocol do you currently use for (most) transaction families?
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 12:21:34 GMT):<br/>
We are favoring protobuf right now for serialisation although we have also tried CBOR and a couple other things.
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 12:28:56 GMT):<br/>
@PacoEcotrust I think a simple way to start on a is to just store EVM accounts and associated storage in global state under the account address plus some prefix.

1) Did I get any of the facts wrong?
2) Ideas/suggestions/thoughts related to the initial "naive solutions"?
3) Additional parts of Burrow and the EVM I need to consider to get a basic, initial implementation functioning?

I think option 3. makes a lot of sense if attainable; suggested option 4. requires more design work and coordination with STL but can reflect better that account storage can potentially be separated out (and is costly in global state)
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 16:51:15 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the quick reply! Reading through it now.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 18:07:20 GMT):<br/>
@benjaminbollen cool.  the biggest hurdle with Option 4 is that the stateful storage would need to keep all state ever generated, not just the latest, in order to appear stateless.  That would probably be less efficient than using the context manager as the database.  within Sawtooth's context manager, great care is taken to avoid state/database writes when things get thrown out.  for example, if you have a block being processed with many batches and many transactions, if one of the transactions is invalid, no writes to state will have occurred (since the merkle root calculation only occurs when needed)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 18:12:33 GMT):<br/>
Another (maybe significant) Con to Option 3 is that there would be increased latency from the back/forth with the validator, which may take longer then Option 1; this would depend on a lot of factors, like how big the storage is and how much savings you get with Option 3 in terms of bandwidth.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 18:14:03 GMT):<br/>
I'm curious if you have some rough numbers in terms of sizes here, like the rough sizes of code, storage, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 18:16:35 GMT):<br/>
Yes, i see the pruning of "rollbacked" state and validator would also have to pass over the tp and be new logic; i dont think we should pursue option 4 now, but on longer term separating account storage from accounts enables both parallisation and privacy. Design can be completely different, not attached to it, but storage and accounts can be separated and it is useful mid-term
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 18:18:20 GMT):<br/>
Storage is effectively unbounded, 2^(512 + 160) bits in total Ethereum "universe"
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 18:18:43 GMT):<br/>
- hope i got the math right there
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 18:23:51 GMT):<br/>
But code starts at a few1 00-1000 bytes per contract - riugh guess. But often per object you create a contract
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 18:25:30 GMT):<br/>
Nice thing of not putting storage in the global treeis that we have 12bytes for sharding 
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 18:26:29 GMT):<br/>
Prefix 3 + zone 12 + address 20
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 18:28:34 GMT):<br/>
The only way to bound storage is to impose it (with Ether or config) 
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 18:58:00 GMT):<br/>
@benjaminbollen: what are a typical number and size of kv pairs stored at a contract address?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 19:23:14 GMT):<br/>
I don't think there is a good answer to that
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 19:23:25 GMT):<br/>
some contracts make use of only a single stored value
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 19:23:47 GMT):<br/>
while others might have objects with 20+ fields in them and several hundred objects
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 19:24:15 GMT):<br/>
typical depends on the use case
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 19:24:37 GMT):<br/>
the size of the values though are never more then 32bytes
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 19:25:32 GMT):<br/>
when you compile solidity code is decided where to put everything
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 19:25:53 GMT):<br/>
it would probably be easier to support off-state state directly in the context manager, and let it manage the complexities than to expose those details to TPs; I think we could attach non-state data to addresses pretty easy as long as it had the constraint of only updating off-state state for addresses being written to
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 19:25:55 GMT):<br/>
so as to hide as much as possible the kv store from you
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 19:28:03 GMT):<br/>
but, off-state state doesn't give you privacy by itself, nor would it be particularly more performant except during state transfer events (whether that be checkpointing or state export)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 19:29:18 GMT):<br/>
I'm interested in more thoughts on how we might use that in combination with other things from a privacy perspective
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 19:37:34 GMT):<br/>
the question of whether unpacking the entirety of state (option 1) is faster than the querying of the parts accessed is interesting. My gut reaction when reading 1 was that since we could have potentially a massive amount of data store under a single contract that option 1 was not feasible
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 19:38:24 GMT):<br/>
doesn't eth's merkle state do #1 today?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 19:39:13 GMT):<br/>

my understanding was that there was a hierarchy of tries going on

<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Thu, 11 May 2017 19:39:51 GMT):<br/>
so each account had its own trie of storage

does it have some kind of key -> hash radix scheme inside the subtrie referenced by storage_root then?

<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 12:38:38 GMT):<br/>
It looks like only the accounts are managed directly by that State type and that account storage is managed in the block cache. Storage points at the state root stored in the account.
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 12:47:25 GMT):<br/>
I am leaning towards separating out accounts, code, and account storage with storage possibly fragmented depending on how that gets used. I am with agreement that these should be managed by the sawtooth context manager as doing so on the TP side would mean reproducing a lot of the effort that went into the CM. All that said, I am working on option 1 for the first pass as it is simple and we can iterate on it more easily once we have something functioning. 
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 14:16:44 GMT):<br/>
Sounds good to me.  If there is a case for the CM to have off-chain state associated with address that we can articulate, I'd like to open a JIRA task for it as I have ideas on the how, but am struggling with the why. :)

<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 15:03:00 GMT):<br/>
Yeah I came to the same conclusion  I think after talking with Silas last night
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 15:09:05 GMT):<br/>
I understand option 1 and its simplicity. But I am worried that the deserialization of all account storage might take much longer then a bunch of individual key queries. If we combine option 2 and 3. One domain has the account data serialized at the nodes. And a second domain stores all contract states. Likely at key `hash(account+storageaddress)` and store there a serialized list of `{account:20bytes, storageaddress:32bytes, value:32bytes}`
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 15:11:00 GMT):<br/>
including the storage address is not necessary but might be good for double checking that an error didn't occur somewhere. If we wanted to obfuscate that we could drop it. 
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 15:12:44 GMT):<br/>
the reason for using a hash (since arguable you could just have it all serialized at the storage address since we are already separating them. Is because solidity uses the lowest keys first for fixed length arguments and higher storage addresses are only really used by mappings and non-fixed arrays
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 15:13:30 GMT):<br/>
so if we just deserialized at the storage root the lowest addresses would likely contain the data for almost every contract which exists on the chain
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 15:26:25 GMT):<br/>
"solidity uses the lowest keys first for fixed length arguments" Could this also be used as an argument for having multiple sequential key-value pairs for a given account stored at a single address in global state? That way you wouldn't always need to deserialize all of storage, but you wouldn't need to send a message to the CM for every address you want?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 15:28:52 GMT):<br/>
well.... 
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 15:29:03 GMT):<br/>
it depends how you are structuring your contracts
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 15:29:19 GMT):<br/>
there are kind of two approachs
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 15:29:19 GMT):<br/>
there are kind of two approaches
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 15:29:50 GMT):<br/>
first you can have a small contract for each object you care about each with self contained logic
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 15:30:06 GMT):<br/>
and the second is that you store all the objects together in a mapping
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 15:31:03 GMT):<br/>
in the first case storing the commonly used low address values together would be a benefit. 
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 15:31:17 GMT):<br/>
in the second Its not going to give you much
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 15:31:43 GMT):<br/>
but it wouldn't hurt too much either if we were sensible about how much we chunked together
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 15:32:12 GMT):<br/>
but that feels like an optimizationg we could add on after the fact
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 15:34:53 GMT):<br/>
I'd be interested to see some solidity code that demonstrates those two approaches. Definitely sounds like there is a fair amount of optimization that can be done. I'm recording your ideas from above in my doc, along with Ben's ideas so we don't lose them.

ok. as a first draft option 1. can definitely work for limited storage
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 15:47:31 GMT):<br/>
@adamludvik are multiple apply requests expected to arrive within the same (preserved) context? and is the TP told about which context it is in?
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 15:48:35 GMT):<br/>
At a mimum we can only use a TxCache per call (which is almost a necessity)
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 15:54:09 GMT):<br/>
The TP is given a Context ID as part of the apply request (TpProcessRequest) which it uses to ask about global state. The ContextManager implements a cache between global state and the TP, which eventually gets synced to global state.
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 15:56:03 GMT):<br/>
So a cache at the TP would be a second layer of caching and would probably just be used to reduce communication between the validator and TP and deserialization/serialization steps.
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 15:56:19 GMT):<br/>
Does that answer your questions?
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 16:18:54 GMT):<br/>
yes, it does.  But there is no concept of opening and closing a context, right; and there is no assumptions for the TP that the same contextID may not have been written to (by other copies of the TP... or ...)
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 16:23:00 GMT):<br/>
or is the ID derived from the subtree and a unique identifier of the whole subtree (and its non-mutation?)
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 16:35:19 GMT):<br/>
I realise Im not making myself clear; is the contextId purely for `State` to synchronise its communications (like a JSONRPC id field); or does it carry meaning;  how long is it valid; invalidated after one responds to the `Apply` request?
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 16:36:04 GMT):<br/>
Im trying to look at the go_inckey to better understand this, but perhaps that s not rich enough to discern fron

^ @boydjohnson @jsmitchell 
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 16:53:38 GMT):<br/>
Those guys can probably answer better than me, but I believe the contextID does a little more than just synchronise communications (we have a field called "correlationID" that does this). The contextID is a handle used by the TP to access a "snapshot" of state that the TP calculates a state delta on top of. The state delta is recorded by the validator without it actually being written to global state. It is valid until the TP finishes processing the request and responds with OK, signaling to the validator that all changes to state have been requested.

In other words, the validator sends off a bunch of requests to one or more processors at once, along with a contextID they should use when asking to set/get state. It then manages multiple snapshots of state for each request using the contextID and records all of the requests to change state that the processors send it. Eventually these get "squashed" together into one state delta and this is used to actually update global state later (I think when the block is published).
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 16:57:31 GMT):<br/>
At some point we will add docs around this topic... If you are feeling ambitious, the context manager is here: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/blob/master/validator/sawtooth_validator/execution/context_manager.py and we have tests for it (with some documentation and ASCII art) here: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/blob/master/validator/tests/unit3/test_context_manager/tests.py
</p>
<p><strong>boydjohnson</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 18:23:36 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, that sounds right. The things that I would point out are that the TP has no control of exactly when the sets it makes to the context manager are actually written to the underlying radix/merkle tree.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 18:35:39 GMT):<br/>
A context id is an opaque/random string which is used to lookup the context on the validator side.  There is a 1-to-1 relationship between context and a request to process a transaction.  A context has a merkle root and a key/value dictionary.  When processing reads, the context manager looks up the context based on the context id then retrieves the read based first on the context's key/value store and then the merkle tree.  when processing writes, the context manager updates the context's key/value dictionary (key being the address, value being the data).  Thus, writes to a context do not immediately cause writes to the merkle tree.  Contexts can also be chained together such that the context manager will look through the chain of contexts for a value, which makes what I just described the simplistic case.  When we need to generate a merkle root hash of state, the scheduler will instruct the context manager to squash together multiple contexts.  This causes a write to the merkle tree (which is batched efficiently, updating only nodes that need updating) resulting in a new merkle root hash.  This is usually associated with the end of a block, as block construction requires we generate a new merkle root hash.  Once squashed, contexts are deleted.
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:02:56 GMT):<br/>
hmmm thats interesting
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:03:43 GMT):<br/>
and possibly problematic
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:04:05 GMT):<br/>
lets say that we have contracts A0 A1 and B
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:04:24 GMT):<br/>
B is storing the number of times it has been called. simple counter
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:06:10 GMT):<br/>
the A contracts (When Called) are calling B and requesting the current count then storing it
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:09:30 GMT):<br/>
if two independent transactions occur (which don't have each other as a dependency and don't appear in the same batch) then my understanding is that two requests to process the transactions will occur (separately)
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:10:41 GMT):<br/>
So if B starts at a counter value of 1 after the transactions are processed B will have 2 and both A's will have 1 which would not be the intended consequence in this case
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:24:53 GMT):<br/>
the transactions that reference the same state are made sequential by the scheduler
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:26:32 GMT):<br/>
the list of input and output addresses and dependent transactions allow the scheduler to determine whether the transactions can be run in parallel off of a common base state and then merged or whether they need to be run sequentially
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:27:57 GMT):<br/>
beyond that, the ordering is prescribed by the block publisher as input to the scheduler
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:28:46 GMT):<br/>
once the schedule is finalized for a set of valid transactions the transaction batches are written into the published block along with the corresponding squashed state root hash
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:28:46 GMT):<br/>
once the schedule is finalized for a set of valid transactions, the transaction batches are written into the published block along with the corresponding squashed state root hash
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:30:37 GMT):<br/>
when a receiving validator validates the block, the ordered set of transactions from the block are submitted to the local scheduler and the same execution graph is produced, which results in the same context exposure to the transaction processors for the transactions, which results in the same squashed set of state transitions, which results in the same state root hash, which results in the block being considered valid
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:31:01 GMT):<br/>
excellent!
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:31:44 GMT):<br/>
so this is already covered and we just need to set it up so it never tries to parallelize (for now and the immediate future)
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:31:56 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:32:23 GMT):<br/>
the easy case is just listing the contract state address as both an input and output
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:32:24 GMT):<br/>
whats the easiest way to do that? Add a fixed input to the list to every transaction?
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:33:17 GMT):<br/>
there are probably cleverer things we can do down the road
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:33:48 GMT):<br/>
Yeah my naive first guess I don't think is safe from malicious actors cause they could choose to manipulate it.
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:34:42 GMT):<br/>
Is it possible that we could add a configuration field flag for transaction processors which determines if it even attempts to parallelize transactions to that transaction family?
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:35:24 GMT):<br/>
the context manager enforces the input and output addresses
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:35:52 GMT):<br/>
if you try to read from an address not listed in input or write to an address not listed in output, the transaction will fail
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:36:32 GMT):<br/>
and the scheduler guarantees isolation based on those addresses (and wildcards)
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:36:32 GMT):<br/>
and the scheduler guarantees isolation based on those addresses (and address prefixes)
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:36:50 GMT):<br/>
hmmm... I don't think i properly understand the inputs and outputs
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:36:55 GMT):<br/>
so, i don't think there is a situation where you can screw it up
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:37:07 GMT):<br/>
are these state addresses?
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:37:11 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:37:33 GMT):<br/>
places the transaction processor will read from and write to as part of the transaction
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:37:46 GMT):<br/>
how does the transaction maker (client) know this information without having a complete copy of state?
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:38:20 GMT):<br/>
it is either easily predictable or they can use a prefix which has the effect of enforcing sequential execution
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:39:06 GMT):<br/>
so, for evm contract execution without chaining, the input addresses would be the location of the contract bytecode and the location of the contract state (if these were stored separately)
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:39:18 GMT):<br/>
and the output address would be the same location of the contract state
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:39:48 GMT):<br/>
with contract chaining, the transaction client would have to list out the same for the downstream contracts
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:40:47 GMT):<br/>
if that is burdensome, you could go so far as to list the namespace prefix which would force the scheduler to make the execution sequential
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:41:41 GMT):<br/>
evm contract address:bytecode is immutable though, right?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:42:04 GMT):<br/>
ok so yeah we currently have no lightweight way to determine ahead of time the possible contracts that will be called.... mostly because you can have addresses of the contracts be arguments sent in during the transaction
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:42:17 GMT):<br/>
the bytecode is immutable yes
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:43:09 GMT):<br/>
worst case the inputs/outputs are wildcarded to enforce serial execution
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:43:37 GMT):<br/>
yes that is acceptable.
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:44:29 GMT):<br/>
but i'm worried (maybe needlessly so) about it being the choice of the client as to whether to enforce serialization
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:45:03 GMT):<br/>
mostly because its not immediately clear to me that that will not lead to edge cases
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:46:16 GMT):<br/>
but I guess that the fact that the context manager enforces serialization on matching inputs and outputs
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:46:19 GMT):<br/>
its fine
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:46:22 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:46:31 GMT):<br/>
None is not an option
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:46:49 GMT):<br/>
the client crafting the transaction can't elect to cause isolation violations
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:47:13 GMT):<br/>
So even if they try to instigate the weirdness I described above they wouldn't be able to cause havok in the rest of the wild carded transactions
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:47:21 GMT):<br/>
perfect
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Fri, 12 May 2017 19:47:25 GMT):<br/>
yep

Not sure this is the right place to put this. I tried to find the github repo for the documentation so I could submit as a PR but couldn't. I think I have found a slight typo in the application developer tutorial.

```
$ sawtooth keygen --key-dir /home/ubuntu/sawtooth/keys/ validator

instead as you can see  it is 8800

</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Sun, 14 May 2017 22:27:09 GMT):<br/>
and then I thought I would press on and try doing the config  tp steps  but when I submitted the transaction a bunch on of these messages popped up
```

Hi @dennismckinnon The docs that reference tcp to load batches to the validator are out of date. It should be http and the rest_api needs to be running. A quick way to get everything (many things) running is to use docker and run this file using docker-compose: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/blob/master/docker/compose/sawtooth-demo.yaml
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 15:39:38 GMT):<br/>
I did do the docker compose route first
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 15:39:42 GMT):<br/>
and I got it working
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 15:40:36 GMT):<br/>
but I wanted to get it running in the vagrant environment so I had the more hands on deeper understanding of how all these pieces fit together
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 15:42:01 GMT):<br/>
mostly because I want to start writing my own transaction processors and clients etc so I cultivate the knowledge of how everything is supposed to connect on our side

WIP branch for Tyler: https://github.com/aludvik/sawtooth-core/blob/evm-tp-part1/sdk/go/src/sawtooth_sdk/client/signer.go
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 20:26:54 GMT):<br/>
Hey all, I have a very preliminary branch that connects the Burrow EVM to the Sawtooth Validator using option 1: https://github.com/aludvik/sawtooth-core/commits/evm-tp-part1 
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 20:27:46 GMT):<br/>
I have a simple python script that creates a transaction and sends it to the REST API. The payload format just mirrors the arguments to `vm.Call()`: https://github.com/aludvik/sawtooth-core/commit/95f9e106f6232dd474e3d6bf55029f6d0dcf51b1
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Mon, 15 May 2017 20:34:02 GMT):<br/>
@dennismckinnon Do you have any ideas or suggestions on how to manually test the EVM using that client_test.py file? What would be the best way to generate the byte code that would be fed into the EVM? Or is that the wrong approach?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 01:08:53 GMT):<br/>
hmm
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 01:09:02 GMT):<br/>
I was actually just thinking about this
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 01:09:28 GMT):<br/>
in order to test the vm we would need to deploy a solidity contract... even a simple one
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 01:09:58 GMT):<br/>
we have a javascript library which hooks into burrow
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 01:12:06 GMT):<br/>
I think the easiest thing right from the start would be if I could pull out the formatted payload from using that library
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:22:41 GMT):<br/>
we can't create one with solc?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:26:59 GMT):<br/>
oh yes
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:27:10 GMT):<br/>
creating the contract data is the easy part
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:27:56 GMT):<br/>
but all the arguments to the evm use a very awkward "homemade" encoding procedure
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:28:36 GMT):<br/>
so the data payload for interacting with the contracts is not nice
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:29:39 GMT):<br/>
so i think the easiest plan for circumventing web3 and the abi encoding procedure for now is to simply intercept the data payload as it currently runs
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:30:03 GMT):<br/>
and see if those same payloads produce the expected result from what adam has put together
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:30:44 GMT):<br/>
then with a bit more time I think I can reroute the js libs we have already to connect to the rest api
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:38:07 GMT):<br/>
this is part of what 'monax pkgs do' does?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:39:49 GMT):<br/>
yes monax pkgs do produces transactions using a command line tool written in go
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:39:54 GMT):<br/>
it does the same task
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:40:10 GMT):<br/>
but I am personally more familiar with the workings of the js libs
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:42:14 GMT):<br/>
In fact I am pretty sure I have found the location of minimal cut for connecting to the rest api
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:42:44 GMT):<br/>
I just need to do more of the tutorials to understand writing clients with the sdks
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:43:32 GMT):<br/>
luckily, js is one of the languages with client support in the sdk

Good 'aye!, dennismckinnon
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:48:52 GMT):<br/>
Nice to meet you
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:49:15 GMT):<br/>
I have no idea what we're talking about, but I'm glad you like the the JS SDK client stuff
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:50:07 GMT):<br/>
Just getting started with it
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:50:51 GMT):<br/>
one question. since its not on npm i assume to `require` the sawtooth-sdk i should point it to the folder in the sawtooth-core repo?
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:51:36 GMT):<br/>
that is one way to do it
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:52:01 GMT):<br/>
just `require('../path/to/sdk')`
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:52:15 GMT):<br/>
You can `npm install` it though
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:52:34 GMT):<br/>
`npm install ../path/to/sdk`
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:52:51 GMT):<br/>
And then `require('sawtooth-sdk')`
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:53:10 GMT):<br/>
(it gets the name from the `package.json`)
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:54:22 GMT):<br/>
that seems the better way :)
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:54:28 GMT):<br/>
:)
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:54:52 GMT):<br/>
Both should work fine. If you do an install, it will copy the files over to `node_modules`, so you will need to install again if there are updates. Probably won't come up since you aren't actively developing it.
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:55:33 GMT):<br/>
You _might_ be able to do a _link_ instead of an install, which does a symlink. That might just be Yarn though.
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:56:17 GMT):<br/>
yeah I'll just make myself a mental note about the re-installing
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:56:27 GMT):<br/>
If you run into trouble, google "npm install local package", and you'll find a bunch of stuff. Should be pretty straightforward though.
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:57:19 GMT):<br/>
You've seen the JS SDK tutorial in the docs yeah?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:57:50 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:58:59 GMT):<br/>
that hopefully makes it pretty clear
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:59:05 GMT):<br/>
let me know if you run into trouble though
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 03:59:12 GMT):<br/>

@adamludvik I am getting a better feeling for it all I'm thinking about and working towards implementing the js client for the burrow family. And I am still trying to get you some test transaction data do you can continue unfortunately I hit a snag and everyone is asleep right now. But ill try to get that to you first thing tomorrow.

I would like to better understand what you have implemented though so as to get a better idea of how we can test. You have implemented "call" but there is some confusion from me since there doesn't seem to be a way to do queries (which run the vm but don't change state and return some data) Is there currently a provision for the rest-api to return data from a transaction (call)? I haven't gone through the xo family tutorial yet which I feel like would probably answer this question since you must have SOME way of querying data out of the chain.

In either case I'll reach out to you tomorrow and we can chat again maybe? for now though... to sleep... perchance to dream. goodnight all!
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 13:44:31 GMT):<br/>
@dennismckinnon I can chat again today if you like. Almost to work now, will send you links shortly about querying. 
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 13:46:18 GMT):<br/>
perfect timing as I just got some test payloads I think.
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:02:17 GMT):<br/>
Here is the REST API spec, _most_ of which is implemented: http://intelledger.github.io/0.8/rest_api/endpoint_specs.html
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:03:15 GMT):<br/>
And here it's being used by XO to submit transactions and query state: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/blob/master/sdk/examples/xo_python/sawtooth_xo/xo_client.py
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:22:23 GMT):<br/>
oh
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:22:41 GMT):<br/>
you are manually handling the querying of state?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:23:01 GMT):<br/>
as in the client needs to know how to access the right storage addresses?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:38:15 GMT):<br/>
yes, the client specifies it's inputs/outputs.  however, can also specify portions of the tree instead of specific nodes.  so for what you are doing, you could just use inputs=[prefix],outputs=[prefix] where prefix is the namespace the txn family is using
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:39:26 GMT):<br/>
thanks shawn. That is the answer to another question I had but not the one I was currently asking :P
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:40:22 GMT):<br/>
ok, expanding on the one you didn't ask - you can think of inputs/outputs as hints for parallelism that are enforced during processing (you can't read/write to addresses you didn't specify)
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:41:23 GMT):<br/>
so when I'm constructing the transactions in js for example. For the inputs I only put the string of hex representation of the domain for the evm
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:41:40 GMT):<br/>
in something like this
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:41:45 GMT):<br/>
```
const encoder = new TransactionEncoder(privateKey, {
    // We don't want a batcher pubkey or dependencies for our example,
    // but this is what setting them might look like:
    // batcherPubkey: '02d260a46457a064733153e09840c322bee1dff34445d7d49e19e60abd18fd0758',
    // dependencies: ['540a6803971d1880ec73a96cb97815a95d374cbad5d865925e5aa0432fcf1931539afe10310c122c5eaae15df61236079abbf4f258889359c4d175516934484a'],
    familyName: 'intkey',
    familyVersion: '1.0',
    inputs: ['1cf12650d858e0985ecc7f60418aaf0cc5ab587f42c2570a884095a9e8ccacd0f6545c'],
    outputs: ['1cf12650d858e0985ecc7f60418aaf0cc5ab587f42c2570a884095a9e8ccacd0f6545c'],
    payloadEncoding: 'application/cbor',
    payloadEncoder: cbor.encode
})
```
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:42:53 GMT):<br/>
so if the domain for the evm was DEADBE those inputs would be just `deadbe`
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:44:10 GMT):<br/>
I think the addresses @adamludvik was defining were prefix+evm_address+padding, so yeah, if prefix=deadbe then inputs: ['deadbe'], outputs: ['deadbe']
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:45:19 GMT):<br/>
for retrieving state via the rest api, you need to be able to calculate the address to retrieve
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:45:23 GMT):<br/>
Ok cool. Now back to the question I was asking :) The evm during its execution can return data in fact its expected to.  
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:45:54 GMT):<br/>
what is it returning data to?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:46:06 GMT):<br/>
the client
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:47:15 GMT):<br/>
we use this in two primary ways
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:51:44 GMT):<br/>
the first is when actually processing a transaction we can get back information about the actual exectuion (did the contract refuse to process the request because it was not the right time or you are not the right user or the specified object you wanted to manipulate did not exist etc) or we have functionality to "simulate" a transaction which doesn't modify state but runs the evm in full against current state. this second mode we use primarily for retrieving structured information from the smart contracts since in order to know where values are being stored we would otherwise need to do some very tricky analysis of the bytecode. In general its easier to just write a function in the smart contract which retrieves the information for you
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:52:17 GMT):<br/>
for example. here is a simple "get-set" contract
```
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;

contract getset {
  uint storedData;

  function set(uint x) {
    storedData = x;
  }

  function get() constant returns (uint retVal) {
    return storedData;
  }
}
```

</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:55:54 GMT):<br/>
so in this example the set function inside the smart contract doesn't return anything (but it could)
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:56:01 GMT):<br/>
it just changes the value
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:56:20 GMT):<br/>
the get function doesn't change state but returns the value we care about
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 14:57:27 GMT):<br/>
this is the dead simple example when we start getting to actual systems we have built we have much more structured data and a lot of returns
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:00:05 GMT):<br/>
I'm available to chat all day today so if you would like to discuss this in a call at some point we can do that :)
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:24:39 GMT):<br/>
@amundson do transactions have unique ids that are available to the client? Or is that only known to the chain and the transaction processor? I know that there is room for specifying dependencies but not sure where you get that from. I'm guessing its the hash of the serialized transaction but I don't see that explicitly stated in the architecture section of the docs
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:25:28 GMT):<br/>
the transaction id is its signature
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:25:36 GMT):<br/>
and is generated by the client
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:29:43 GMT):<br/>
as in the header_signature?
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:30:08 GMT):<br/>
yep
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:30:25 GMT):<br/>
ok excellent
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:30:52 GMT):<br/>
ben and I were brainstorming alternative methods for getting the returns of evm calls back
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:32:07 GMT):<br/>
one simple idea is to have them written to state in another domain under the transaction id
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:35:06 GMT):<br/>
the only downsides are, 1)The purpose of simulated calls was to be quick queries which did not need to be confirmed into state. (with tendermint this process would take 2 seconds which for read access is not really good) 2)by writing returns into state this means that alot of unnecessary query data would be stored to the chain. I can think of some uses cases for this (such as proof of access) but for most its just wasteful
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:51:02 GMT):<br/>
where are the simulated calls used?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:51:42 GMT):<br/>
in the code? or in practice?
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:51:51 GMT):<br/>
in practice
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:52:24 GMT):<br/>
well in the example above with the get set contract, since the get function does not modify state it would be a simulated call
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:52:43 GMT):<br/>
(no blocks need to be formed its just a query)
</p>

(PR up with initial implementation and scripts to build it: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/pull/470)
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:54:05 GMT):<br/>
are these calls invoked by a client? or as part of contract chaining?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:55:23 GMT):<br/>
simulated calls are invoked by the client
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:55:53 GMT):<br/>
against what version of state?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:55:53 GMT):<br/>
they run a transaction exactly as if it were a normal transaction. but state doesn't get changed
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:56:39 GMT):<br/>
so, it's basically the contract defining an interface for the exposure of its private storage
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:56:49 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:56:56 GMT):<br/>

@pschwarz ^
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:57:42 GMT):<br/>
pertinent to our discussion of segregation of namespace from logic
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:58:05 GMT):<br/>
because eth contracts define their own storage format, it's an additional abstraction
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 15:59:33 GMT):<br/>
but, there may be a pattern there around requesting/rendering vs. invocation for the purposes of executing a transaction
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 16:01:45 GMT):<br/>
having the capability of triggering a transaction processor and having it return some data without the transaction actually having to go through consensus has been incredibly useful for us
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 16:02:21 GMT):<br/>
One thing I use it for is to copy segments of smart contract data into a traditional sql table for easier querying
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 17:31:15 GMT):<br/>
@dennismckinnon @benjaminbollen We had a local discussion here around events and querying. Instead of querying at the TP level, we could instead run an additional instance of the EVM that interacts with the REST API directly (using a different implementation of the AppState interface).
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 17:32:39 GMT):<br/>
This would also allow us to determine which addresses will be read/written from prior to submitting a transaction to the validator and possibly provide a place to implement an event system.
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 17:34:35 GMT):<br/>
interesting

</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 17:37:27 GMT):<br/>
So in that picture it seems like the client has to run their own evm and then it fetches state from the rest api to run against?
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 17:39:26 GMT):<br/>
Yeah. So if the client is only reading from state, it won't result in transactions being sent to the validator. However, if it is changing state, it could construct transactions that get sent to the validator and end up at the TP where it modifies state.
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 17:41:21 GMT):<br/>
The client would also be able to "listen" for changes to specific addresses using the REST API State Delta Subscription that @pschwarz to set up an event system.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 17:55:56 GMT):<br/>
I'm mulling it over. It seems fine though. Only concern is the added complexity to the client having to run its own evm (and ensuring its running the same version as the transaction processor).
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 18:07:29 GMT):<br/>
as a general note (from the sideline; apologies for being absent here) I see value in separating the questions of validation to the questions of querying; and with burrow we are pushing (as fast as we can) to a cleaner separation
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 18:09:55 GMT):<br/>
The event system, in its current form, runs over ZMQ, but we have some plans for accessing it via a web socket provided by the REST API
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 18:18:32 GMT):<br/>
(in case of burrow, to have tx and query input and output-result streams only on a verifying (not validating) node; we call it a "worker" - which has a full copy of state; then from there snapshot and export state and combine it with light client work to enable non-fully replicated clients)
</p>
<p><strong>benjaminbollen</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 18:22:21 GMT):<br/>
to the extent that that is not helpful here; I want to put up a warning against allowing queries against validator/mining nodes; it is imo an undesirable paradigm;
for the immediate term, getting the state from validator and running a client-side TP* is a good step - if that s how I understood the above sketch
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 18:44:06 GMT):<br/>
yep, that's the intent

<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 19:13:26 GMT):<br/>
this is from the first contract deployment?

<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 19:13:29 GMT):<br/>
yep
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 19:14:03 GMT):<br/>
I don't see any sstores
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 19:14:16 GMT):<br/>
this looks good to me
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 19:14:28 GMT):<br/>
but you could check to see if the account was created
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 19:15:17 GMT):<br/>
OH
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 19:15:21 GMT):<br/>
I don't think it was. I have debug statements in SawtoothAppState, and I don't see any of them printing.
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 19:15:28 GMT):<br/>
you were confused why you DONT see a SSTORE
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 19:15:53 GMT):<br/>
you don't see it because code is stored in a different place than ... storage
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 19:16:12 GMT):<br/>
the sstore opcode is for putting something into storage
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 19:16:47 GMT):<br/>
as for why there isn't a create
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 19:16:52 GMT):<br/>
that part is weird to me
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 19:17:07 GMT):<br/>
oh wait
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 19:17:40 GMT):<br/>
i think maybe the returning the code in memory is what triggers the storage into the account code slot
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 19:18:15 GMT):<br/>
whereas the create opcode is used to create a contract from another already existing contract
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 19:18:22 GMT):<br/>
(what we call contract factories)
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 19:20:39 GMT):<br/>
Still something seems weird
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 16 May 2017 19:21:33 GMT):<br/>
I thought the evm would return the address of the created contract

I have written up a Sawtooth Burrow-EVM 0.1 Transaction Family Spec which I intend to follow for the rest of the integration. I believe it describes a system with the minimum set of functionality which we can use to iterate on for further improvements. I have posted it for public review and comment here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mHaM9MPJD9jGqyJfvrJsj9eSYLBdBLbccYJ8-B1CWgY/edit?usp=sharing

Hi adam

<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:22:44 GMT):<br/>
Hi @adamludvik 
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:23:38 GMT):<br/>
all of these data fields were generated by using the javascript libraries we have in order to do the formatting
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:24:15 GMT):<br/>
but I intercepted the payload on its way to the existing version of burrow
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:24:27 GMT):<br/>
as for how calling a contract works
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:24:55 GMT):<br/>
iirc what happens is that the address field is that of an existing contract and so the code of the contract gets run
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:25:31 GMT):<br/>
the data payload becomes the message data (not 100% what its called in the code i can dig into that in a bit)
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:26:47 GMT):<br/>
basically the code gets loaded from the account that you are calling and gets submitted to the evm which also has state, memory and message data available to it to work with
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:27:01 GMT):<br/>
I think that might be called the context of the evm instance but not sure
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:28:26 GMT):<br/>
anyways in the first we are creating a new contract so the address would be null and that makes the message data run and any return data from that run is the contract code during this time it can also modify state of the new contract's account
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:28:56 GMT):<br/>
in the second its is structured data so that the evm can pull out the contract function call arguments
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:29:15 GMT):<br/>
once upon a time we had to do this by hand but solidity and the abi do all the formatting
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:29:42 GMT):<br/>
the first 4 bytes are a trick to specify which function is being called
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:29:52 GMT):<br/>
and the rest are arguments
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:30:17 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:30:28 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:32:36 GMT):<br/>
seth is the client, load creates a new contract with the initialization data, exec calls the loaded contract with the given "message data" I think you called it, and show just dumps everything out in state at the address
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:33:02 GMT):<br/>
There are a bunch of simplifications going on here, but the bare minimum functionality is there
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:34:04 GMT):<br/>
hmmm
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:34:16 GMT):<br/>
its weird though... the contract data looks wrong to me
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:35:44 GMT):<br/>
nvm
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:36:16 GMT):<br/>
its just weird to me that it has the 606060 start....
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:36:34 GMT):<br/>
because I thought that was part of the contract deployment code
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:36:46 GMT):<br/>
and didn't usually end up in the final code
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:37:03 GMT):<br/>
but I just checked your raw evm output again from last week
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:37:17 GMT):<br/>
and it seems like that does get included
</p>

<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:38:38 GMT):<br/>
Is there any additional processing that needs to happen with output the EVM gives after executing the contract deployment code?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:38:51 GMT):<br/>
ah! message data = call data
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:38:54 GMT):<br/>
thats right
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:39:03 GMT):<br/>
been a while since i worked with the raw opcodes
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:40:39 GMT):<br/>
Sorry, that was after doing the get transaction
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:40:39 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:40:59 GMT):<br/>
this looks right

</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:43:13 GMT):<br/>
would be returned to the client
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:43:31 GMT):<br/>
You can see it do SSTORE in that second file.
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:43:47 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:43:52 GMT):<br/>
this is wonderful
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:44:07 GMT):<br/>
and it has no return data
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:44:10 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, I am thinking we implement a simpler version of the EVM wrapper we did with the TP on the client side, so you can actually return the value from the client
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:44:16 GMT):<br/>
Like we discussed
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:44:22 GMT):<br/>
(though in practice it normally would)
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:44:48 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:45:16 GMT):<br/>
though that does make it a wee bit complicated for non-query type returns
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:45:31 GMT):<br/>
like if the set returned a confirmation code
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:45:36 GMT):<br/>
or an errorcode
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:46:07 GMT):<br/>
hmm, we will have to figure out how to handle those too then
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:46:10 GMT):<br/>
you wouldn't want to get that by simulating the call first and ignoring reality when it got into a block
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:46:29 GMT):<br/>
mostly because it could be unreliable by the time it got into the block
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:46:45 GMT):<br/>
but as ben pointed out before
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:46:45 GMT):<br/>
that makes sense
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:47:11 GMT):<br/>
if you have a forking chain consensus algorithm then this doesn't always make sense
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:47:35 GMT):<br/>
I'm guessing that if there is some kind of event pipe to send it back through then thats the best you could do
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:48:40 GMT):<br/>
Anyways this is awesome!
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:49:42 GMT):<br/>
Since this seems to be working I'll focus on writing a dumbed down version of the jslibs we have
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:49:47 GMT):<br/>
to hook into sawtooth
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:50:30 GMT):<br/>
We should try deploying a slightly more complex contract too. Do you think it would be hard to write something in the same vein as the intkey family in solidity?
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:50:32 GMT):<br/>
http://intelledger.github.io/transaction_family_specifications/integerkey_transaction_family.html
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:51:01 GMT):<br/>
three functions?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:51:19 GMT):<br/>
set(key, value), inc(key, value), dec(key,value)?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:51:19 GMT):<br/>
set(key, value), inc(key), dec(key)?
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:51:28 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, basically.
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:51:41 GMT):<br/>
Right now we just have one key, right?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:52:39 GMT):<br/>
oh really?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:52:47 GMT):<br/>
so you don't even specify the key?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:53:01 GMT):<br/>
it basically the get set contract with two additional functions?
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:53:16 GMT):<br/>
I mean, in that contract code you provided. There isn't a key, just one value you can set/get.
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:53:31 GMT):<br/>
In the intkey family, there are many keys
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:54:02 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:54:14 GMT):<br/>
what can the keys be?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:55:10 GMT):<br/>
or do you care if i just make the key and integer
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:55:37 GMT):<br/>
The keys are "utf-8 encoded strings with a maximum of 20 characters" in the spec, but we can do whatever makes sense in the land of smart contracts. So an integer would be fine.
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:57:13 GMT):<br/>
Another thing that would be useful is a brief write-up of how to generate the blobs you provided originally. (contract deployment code, function call code) I have been playing with solc, but haven't gotten very far yet.
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:57:32 GMT):<br/>
yeah solc is only half the battle
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:58:04 GMT):<br/>
in order to format your data for calls you use the abi
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 17:58:38 GMT):<br/>
which has to be one of the most confusing things ever... most of the time I just imagine it as a black box

by the way adam
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 18:13:29 GMT):<br/>
if this was an actual contract you would recognize the structure
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 18:13:44 GMT):<br/>
its much like the handlers you demoed yesterday
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 18:13:54 GMT):<br/>
an bunch of checks to validate input
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 18:14:06 GMT):<br/>
followed by some changes to state
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 18:14:38 GMT):<br/>
basically smart contracts are their own transaction handlers running in a vm

@adamludvik I can do two things for you. One is I can tear out the parts of the javascript libraries that do the formatting of data payloads and expose that functionality for you
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 18:23:21 GMT):<br/>
or I can write a client to hook into the rest-api and will submit the transactions
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 18:23:35 GMT):<br/>
unless you already have a js lib for that
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 18:23:55 GMT):<br/>
in which case I can focus on incorporating the formatter in with it
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 18:24:36 GMT):<br/>
in either case its going to be a day or two worth of work to get it done since I have to be carefule about not breaking that black box
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 18:25:10 GMT):<br/>
but i'm planning on working this weekend somewhat so I could probably have it monday or tuesday
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 18:44:18 GMT):<br/>
That `seth` client is interacting with the REST API and submitting transactions, but it is pretty basic right now. I think it would be interesting to have a tool that outputs those blobs you generated, but I'm not quite sure what it would look like yet. Also, thanks for coding that up and dumping the output for me!
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 26 May 2017 18:49:51 GMT):<br/>
Long term, we will need to write a client that supports interacting with smart contracts in whatever way is most natural/accepted by the community. This implementation is more of a PoC than anything else. Once I get this merged, we will want to write a second version of the spec that solves a lot of these other problems that you, @amundson and @benjaminbollen have brought up.

@benjaminbollen @dennismckinnon how often are the block information op codes used in practice in smart contracts (0x4?)?
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 17:08:58 GMT):<br/>
I have updated the spec and am going to start converting it to Sphinx. I also updated the Appendix in the doc. It is now a catalogue of the work that needs to be completed for the integration to reach maturity. My hope is that we can use it to assign specific tasks going forward and collaborate more efficiently: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mHaM9MPJD9jGqyJfvrJsj9eSYLBdBLbccYJ8-B1CWgY/edit?usp=sharing
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 18:05:47 GMT):<br/>
@amundson the most useful of those tends to be TIMESTAMP (0x42)
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 18:07:40 GMT):<br/>
NUMBER can on occasion be useful and there are some use cases for blockhash (mostly as a source of an "unpredictable" number even though its not truly random which is an interesting question in its own right)
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 18:09:08 GMT):<br/>
but of these TIMESTAMP is definitely the most widely used
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 18:09:45 GMT):<br/>
i would say >50% of applications we have written make use of timestamp.
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 18:10:15 GMT):<br/>
normally its in the case of tracking when an instrument comes to maturity
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Thu, 01 Jun 2017 18:10:34 GMT):<br/>
why do you ask?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 22:42:57 GMT):<br/>
@dennismckinnon thanks.  I ask because I needed another opinion on whether we should expose block information to sawtooth transaction processors.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 22:48:05 GMT):<br/>
I'm very interested in learning the mechanics around trusting a block's timestamp
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:01:39 GMT):<br/>
Well... in non forking consensus its extremely useful. I can see that it might be less reliable in a forking consensus model
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:02:25 GMT):<br/>
how do you know the block wasn't generated with an inaccurate timestamp?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:02:38 GMT):<br/>
(from a network perspective)
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:14:56 GMT):<br/>
@amundson in the case of bitcoin the timestamp is in the blockheader, blocks are rejected by nodes if the timestamp is > +/- 2 hours of your local clock
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:15:54 GMT):<br/>
also your blocktime must be later than the last block time
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:16:54 GMT):<br/>
looks like that is much tighter in ethereum - Is block.timestamp <= now + 900 and is block.timestamp >= parent.timestamp?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:17:54 GMT):<br/>
must ignore timestamp on historical blocks
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:20:26 GMT):<br/>
what do you mean
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:21:47 GMT):<br/>
well, if you start from genesis and use +/- 2 hours, very few blocks are going to satisfy that
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:21:55 GMT):<br/>
(only the most recent)
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:22:40 GMT):<br/>
The only checks that are done are relative to the previous parent, and your local time
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:23:30 GMT):<br/>
I guess it's really not +/-
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:23:34 GMT):<br/>
it's just +
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:24:02 GMT):<br/>
so if some reason the previous miner chose to skew the block they published to actual time + 2 hours
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:24:15 GMT):<br/>
you're only response is the do their timestamp + 1 second
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:24:35 GMT):<br/>
which if the network accepted their block, and more than 1 second has elapsed since they broadcast, than they should accept your block
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:25:00 GMT):<br/>
ohhh
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:25:15 GMT):<br/>
you don't check block timestamp for correctness when you are syncing
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:25:28 GMT):<br/>
if that's what you are asking
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:25:35 GMT):<br/>
that's what I was suggesting, yes
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:25:42 GMT):<br/>
you just assume that it was correct if that is on the 'most work' chain
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:26:15 GMT):<br/>
theirs no way to confirm a posteriori
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:27:11 GMT):<br/>
so in a way it's like your 'distributed oracle'
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:27:38 GMT):<br/>
the block timestamp is a type of "transaction" that the network agrees to at the time, but can't be verified after
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:27:38 GMT):<br/>
in bond, we injected clock transactions which worked in a similar fashion - https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/blob/0-7/extensions/bond/sawtooth_bond/updates/clock.py
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Mon, 05 Jun 2017 23:27:45 GMT):<br/>
yup
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 01:58:03 GMT):<br/>
@amundson you generally dont need it to be precise. Most legal instruments either care about ordering or time within some fairly wide degree of tolerance. They usually dont care about second minute or even hour accuracy
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 02:01:27 GMT):<br/>
But based on the discussion above which i only partially followed are you saying that there is absolutely no mechamisms to bound the error in the timestamp. A block could have a timestamp 10 years. 100 years out?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 02:02:07 GMT):<br/>
Most applications in that sense only care about timestamp to indicate approximate time after which execution is possible
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 02:03:25 GMT):<br/>
There are some like randao type contracts which would place closer constraints but in those cases you could substitute NUMBER as a potentially more reliable indication of passed time?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 02:03:36 GMT):<br/>
Maybe even thats not the case
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 02:03:54 GMT):<br/>
You will have to let me know about that
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 14:01:13 GMT):<br/>
@dennismckinnon have you seen any contracts that use a "before TIMESTAMP" check instead of "after TIMESTAMP"?
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 14:32:37 GMT):<br/>
Are those just negations of each other? Anything that can be formulated as after TIMESTAMP can be reformulated as NOT before TIMESTAMP and vice versa
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 14:42:35 GMT):<br/>
they have different assurances based on how TIMESTAMP is bounded
</p>
<p><strong>dennismckinnon</strong> (Tue, 06 Jun 2017 15:04:58 GMT):<br/>
I see... sort of. I am able to convince myself both ways right now :P In any case before TIMESTAMP logic can on occasion happen.
</p>

@silasdavis Yes, we have done some research and design work towards implementing that interface. We are also planning to support (most of) the JSON-RPC methods defined here: https://monax.io/docs/documentation/db/latest/specifications/api/

@adamludvik is there any design work I could see? Do you plan to support RLP serialisation and secp256k1 keys?
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 13:47:39 GMT):<br/>
Sure, I will put something together to share with you. Our goal is for existing apps built on web3.js to be able to transition to Sawtooth as seamlessly as possible. I am not aware of how those features are used in that context, so we do not have plans to support them.. yet. Could you elaborate more on how those are used and why we might want to support them?

RLP is the serialization schema used by Ethereum
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 15:26:21 GMT):<br/>
we already support SECP256k1 @silasdavis - it is our dominant signing algorithim
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 15:32:39 GMT):<br/>
I know what RLP and secp256k1 are. I am wondering how they are relevant to supporting web3.js
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 15:42:51 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis to clarify, we are planning to implement a JSON-RPC server that provides (most of) the methods used by web3.js and burrow, not write a new web3.js library. The only place I can think of off the top of my head where the encoding scheme and encryption scheme would come into play at that layer is with the `eth_sendRawTransaction` rpc method and maybe the `transact` (which the monax docs say is unsafe) and `broadcastTx` (which the monax docs say is not useful yet).
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 16:52:42 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, looks promising.

Regarding the encoding it depends what assumptions are made by web3 clients. If all they do is use the hashes returned by web3 methods as arguments to other calls, like the hash from `eth_sendTransaction` being used for `eth_getTransactionByHash` then it shouldn't matter
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 16:53:10 GMT):<br/>
but if they do things like try to form a particular blocks hash client-side and query it then it is a problem
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 16:53:25 GMT):<br/>
perhaps that is not mainstream behaviour I'm not sure 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 16:54:20 GMT):<br/>
As you say `eth_sendRawTransaction` would be an issue. Also we can't implement the various 'uncle' block methods
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 16:54:31 GMT):<br/>
but that's fine and no way around it

Another thing I think we need to do is break out the Burrow EVM in to an clearly reusable library rather than the copy pasting we currently have
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 17:00:07 GMT):<br/>
there are already some fixes that are in Burrow not in your version
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 17:00:27 GMT):<br/>
and it would be nice if we had an easy way for you to push any improvements or fixes upstream
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 17:01:18 GMT):<br/>
Did you make any/many changes to the EVM code when integrating it?
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 17:19:54 GMT):<br/>
Sounds like we are on roughly the same page. I agree that it would be better to depend on a separate burrow repository rather than have the code copied into ours. We only did that as a temporary convenience until the EVM is in a more reusable form.

We did make a couple small changes to the evm code which I will send shortly.

</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 17:27:03 GMT):<br/>
I think that is the only functional change made so far. The other modifications have just been fixing some   typos/missing pieces from when the evm was initially committed.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 17:45:13 GMT):<br/>
So you could could just depend on Burrow, you'll only pay for what you import (not a great story with dependency management in go so far, though I am just trialling https://github.com/golang/dep).

Not sure if Ben did any earlier editing to break any dependencies, easy enough to check
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 07 Sep 2017 17:47:45 GMT):<br/>
If we had a pure EVM repo would you vendor it?

The sawtooth-core git repo you have is quite recent?

<p><strong>boydjohnson</strong> (Fri, 15 Sep 2017 16:50:17 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure. @adamludvik wrote the `build_all` script. Do you have any ideas?
</p>
<p><strong>ktimam</strong> (Fri, 15 Sep 2017 16:51:40 GMT):<br/>
Is there a ready made docker image on docker hub that i can use directly, i'm interested in the ethereum vm capabilities?
</p>
<p><strong>boydjohnson</strong> (Fri, 15 Sep 2017 16:58:19 GMT):<br/>
I don't think so for our evm transaction processor, seth-tp.
</p>
<p><strong>ktimam</strong> (Fri, 15 Sep 2017 17:00:22 GMT):<br/>
Does the step [--- Running sawtooth-dev-go ---] have to run for docker-compose to succeed?

<p><strong>boydjohnson</strong> (Fri, 15 Sep 2017 17:01:16 GMT):<br/>
I think so.
</p>
<p><strong>ktimam</strong> (Fri, 15 Sep 2017 17:04:44 GMT):<br/>
It seems to be searching for build_go in the wrong path, its directly under /bin?
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Fri, 15 Sep 2017 17:21:54 GMT):<br/>
@ktimam Ethereum support is still in the early stages and we do not have a ready made docker image available yet. Make sure you are running `build_all` from `sawtooth-core` (you should have to do `./bin/build_all`). You can use `./bin/build_all -l go` to skip the other langauges. 
</p>

Regarding seth-rpc, is there any timeline for when it would be available? Is it possible to deploy Solidity contracts and work with them through applications (mobile and web) without seth-rpc?
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Fri, 15 Sep 2017 22:09:37 GMT):<br/>
@ktimam seth-rpc should be complete in the next few weeks
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Fri, 15 Sep 2017 22:10:02 GMT):<br/>
you can currently deploy solidity contracts I believe, but interacting with them through Web3 is not yet possible until seth rpc is available
</p>
<p><strong>ktimam</strong> (Sat, 16 Sep 2017 20:05:41 GMT):<br/>
I tried building on Ubuntu build, and all is working flawlessly, seems to be a windows issue. Thanks @kelly_ @adamludvik @boydjohnson for your help, highly appreciated
</p>
<p><strong>ktimam</strong> (Sat, 16 Sep 2017 20:07:31 GMT):<br/>
One more question if you would allow me, are there any documentation/tutorials for compiling solidity code and running it on the node (i'm guessing the process is different than ethereum)?
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Sat, 16 Sep 2017 20:47:55 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Sat, 16 Sep 2017 20:48:07 GMT):<br/>

Thanks @kelly_ . I was wondering if it is possible to use sawtooth burrow with truffle, i've been trying to migrate the contract using port 8080 of the seth-client instance, but it fails to connect?

pinging the seth-client ip address work fine though

</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Mon, 18 Sep 2017 15:49:54 GMT):<br/>
@ktimam We do not have any documentation/tutorials for compiling solidity code and running it yet. The plan is to have some of this complete by the end of September, as @kelly_ mentioned.
</p>
<p><strong>ktimam</strong> (Mon, 18 Sep 2017 16:07:10 GMT):<br/>

Not sure if this is helpful @ktimam but you might be able to see the Jira list here: https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=3&view=planning&selectedIssue=STL-648&epics=visible&selectedEpic=STL-447
@adamludvik Looking at that epic, it seems like the functionality should be done (need some logging, unit tests, etc.). I can't tell if STL-648 is required for @ktimam's interests or not (which I assume are 'can I use Truffle').
</p>
<p><strong>ktimam</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 15:53:28 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @Dan

<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Mon, 09 Oct 2017 19:10:30 GMT):<br/>
@ktimam We have the Ethereum JSON RPC API mostly implemented, but have not done integration testing with it against web3.js yet. We have not implemented the Burrow JSON RPC API yet. I am working on writing some better docs first in the hopes of enabling the community to maybe help make the last push towards getting all the pieces talking correctly.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 13:23:20 GMT):<br/>
Hey @adamludvik is the Web3 stuff on a branch anywhere I could look at, fine with it being preliminary 
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 15:09:56 GMT):<br/>
It is in our master branch now: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/tree/master/families/seth/rpc
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 15:11:22 GMT):<br/>
As mentioned above the next thing that needs to happen is to fire up web3.js, point it at the running seth-rpc, try interacting with it, and start fixing any inconsistencies.
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 15:12:07 GMT):<br/>
I am slowly getting the documentation done now, but I am dividing my time between writing that and researching tendermint

<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 15:13:09 GMT):<br/>
I heard from @amundson that you may have some feedback re: tendermint+sawtooth
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 16:01:43 GMT):<br/>
that's great, I need to avoid the temptation to get distracted on this now, but I think we'd definitely like to work with you more on the Burrow integration
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 16:01:58 GMT):<br/>
regarding Tendermint, and I've been speaking to @amundson just now
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 16:06:15 GMT):<br/>
Tendermint has a rather larger idea of what it thinks its job is as a consensus engine that I think Sawtooth does via its consensus interface

</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 16:07:04 GMT):<br/>
in particular it expects to deal with gossip of transactions, formations of blocks, proposing of blocks, signing of blocks
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 10 Oct 2017 16:08:53 GMT):<br/>
and exposes a callback interface (called ABCI) that you implement with the main methods of `CheckTx` and `DeliverTx`, the former it uses to check transactions it receives to its mempool against a disposable state cache (that the ABCI app - the implementer of the callback interface), and the latter it uses to verify a block before it is committed

You might be able hook directly into their `ConsensusReactor` but its not their intended public interface: https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/master/consensus/reactor.go

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 11:05:00 GMT):<br/>
@adamludvik in case it is useful, here is my more recent implementation of the Burrow ABCI app - our interface to Tendermint: https://github.com/silasdavis/burrow/blob/bosmarmot/consensus/tendermint/abci/app.go
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 11:05:42 GMT):<br/>
whereon it is passed to the tendermint `Node` on launch here: https://github.com/silasdavis/burrow/blob/bosmarmot/consensus/tendermint/tendermint.go#L52-L55
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 11:06:48 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Wed, 11 Oct 2017 14:21:49 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis Thanks for the info! This confirms the research I did yesterday and helps a lot. I have some internal discussions today re:ABCI and will share the output after that.

the used to be a solidity section in the sawtooth docs which has been removed in the RC's... my understanding was that sawtooth could use the EVM to run smart contracts, does this still hold? Can someone point me out where in the code I can find the EVM integration please?
</p>

I guess this is it https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/tree/master/families/seth

<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Mon, 04 Dec 2017 21:56:53 GMT):<br/>
@ddcprg We removed Seth from the core repo and the RC's due to some licensing issues we did not have time to resolve. Improvements to the new repo will be made starting January.

Hey everyone. I want to use a distributed ledger to start storing information that can be accessed across a few different offices. I specifically want to use Seth because of the Ethereum smart contracts. I need some material to get started though. Can anyone share some helpful links on how to get started using seth or just the sawtooth ledger in general. Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Sat, 09 Dec 2017 22:43:04 GMT):<br/>
Sure. You can install Sawtooth directly to ubuntu using apt-get, or run it through docker, or launch it on amazon from the marketplace. Instructions for each of those are in the sys admin guide here: https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/1.0.0rc4/sysadmin_guide.html
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Sat, 09 Dec 2017 22:45:34 GMT):<br/>
@amundson || @adamludvik where would one find the Seth docs these days? I see the Seth repo has a broken link in the readme. 
https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Sat, 09 Dec 2017 22:48:34 GMT):<br/>
@PallabPaul above I link to docs for the latest Sawtooth code which is nearing 1.0 release. A stable release (v0.8) is also available and the Seth documentation for that can be found here: https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/0.8/solidity_developers_guide.html 
</p>
<p><strong>PallabPaul</strong> (Sun, 10 Dec 2017 04:01:10 GMT):<br/>
@Dan thank you very much I am really looking forward to using Seth
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Mon, 11 Dec 2017 16:33:08 GMT):<br/>
Currently the only way to read the seth docs is from the source: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/blob/master/docs/source/introduction.rst. They are not being published anywhere. @Dan, the link you sent above to the 0.8 docs is out of date.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Mon, 11 Dec 2017 17:21:47 GMT):<br/>
do we have a plan to get the seth docs building?

@Dan I do not know what the plan for building seth docs or cleaning up the new repo in general is, but as far as I am aware it is not a priority currently.

as you can see, the first `seth account create` failed, with a panic, but setting `--nonce=0` made it work. this is not always the case ;(
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Mon, 18 Dec 2017 20:48:12 GMT):<br/>
@grkvlt To clarify, `seth account create` always fails when you omit --`nonce=0` and it sometimes fails even when you do?

<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Mon, 18 Dec 2017 21:13:54 GMT):<br/>
er, yes @adamludvik - it even seemed like it would fail if the key file and alias were not the same (i.e. `seth account import name.pem name`) at least if they're the same and i set the nonce it would always work. anyway, it seems like if i set the nonce value it always works now, so maybe my setup was broken before...

I've added a PR that builds the Seth documentation at https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/pull/4 which @PallabPaul  might find useful, but I wasn't sure how to handle links to the `sawtooth-core` documentation, maybe @Dan or someone could take a look?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 19 Dec 2017 20:26:41 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 02:27:09 GMT):<br/>
@Dan I've also created https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/pull/5 which updates `sawtooth-seth` to be compatible with Sawtooth 1.0.0 - I just finished testing it with the 1.0.0rc6 release (plus the two extra PRs mentioned in the comments) and it seems ok so far, but would appreciate someone else taking a look
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 02:28:24 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 02:47:41 GMT):<br/>
I filed https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/STL-959 about the issue with account creation failing in Seth. Looks like the Hyperledger JIRA needs a 'component' category for Seth added, only Burrow EVM exists at the moment, so I used thst?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 16:11:38 GMT):<br/>
@grkvlt you are not stepping on any toes. these are great!
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 16:11:57 GMT):<br/>
@mfford can you look into adding a jira component for Seth?

<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 19:10:35 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 19:10:35 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @Dan - I'm thinking of doing some work to get the Docker images in better shape. Over 1 GiB for an image makes for slow startup! I've also got a Dockerfile to build an image for the `smallbank-workload`, which would be useful for people doing perf testing. I'll add images for the other workload tools and put it alongside the other files in `docker/` for the moment? It's also pretty big when built, so I'm guilty of this too,  but I plan to use the same techniques to slim down _all_ the images in a single PR...
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Wed, 20 Dec 2017 23:11:31 GMT):<br/>
@grkvlt just letting you know I really appreciate your contributions to seth.
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Fri, 22 Dec 2017 21:25:15 GMT):<br/>
btw, i realised after looking at the code that the `alias` for a seth account *must* be the same as the filename for the key, i.e. `test.pem` must have alias `test` and `more.wif` must have alias `more`, so why does the import command need both:
```$ seth account import alias.pem alias
```
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Fri, 22 Dec 2017 21:26:33 GMT):<br/>
i guess i could look at updating the code to choose the alias based on the key filename, unless people think the change should go the other way (i.e. save the key filename with the alias, and allow them to be different) - wdyt?

@adamludvik I have created https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/pull/7 which makes the Seth build use the `1-0` branch of Core, which should fix any build errors. I suggest that once this is merged we should create a branch of the Seth repository based on that (which is compatible with 1.0.x) and I will then work on updating the master Seth branch to be compatible with the master branch of Core next...

Looking for a point release of Burrow in the next few weeks that I think you will probably want to integrate into Seth - including many improvements of encapsulation and EVM compatibility 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 15:45:19 GMT):<br/>
I'd recommend using the dep tool (https://github.com/golang/dep) that seems to be at very real risk of providing actual working dependency management for Go, and you can pull us in as a dependency. Either vendor us a check us in (best Go experience) or do it as part of build. Dep will very soon support vendor pruning (https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/944) so vendoring in-repo will be basically free - no extraneous packages - and you'll be go get-able. In context of STL doesn't help, but nice for contributors working on tests 
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 15:52:05 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis that sounds great, I'll take a look at how we could integrate that into the Seth build

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 16:18:38 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis are you suggesting we fix the seth repo on a point release of burrow? sounds fine. I think there is some work to get to that point, as we are still using the internal fork.
</p>

@amundson I'd definitely like to get Seth updated to be compatible with the latest sawtooth, and also with the latest Burrow EVM, but I'm also thinking about improvements to the CLI tools in terms of output and usability, and working on exposing more configuration and performance tuning properties. I need to dig into the Seth code further to get a better understanding of how it works, though...

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 18:05:52 GMT):<br/>
to summarize, some priorites are: 1) getting seth completely updated to sawtooth 1.0; 2) build/docker enhancements; 3) externalize and use next burrow point release; 4) web3.js compatility
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 13 Feb 2018 18:06:19 GMT):<br/>
5) CLI/tool enhancements

how to run seth ? can i build or do some command to add it to transaction family.

@grkvlt Can you help @kakuzu ?
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Wed, 14 Feb 2018 21:12:07 GMT):<br/>
@kakuzu at the moment it's a bit involved - the `hyperledger/sawtooth-block-info-tp` image isn't on docker hub yet, so you need to build `sawtooyh-core` images first (run `./bin/build_all`) then check out `sawtooth-seth` and try `docker-compose up` after editing `docker-compose.yaml` to remove `hyperledger/` from the image used to start `block-info-tp`... there's a pull request waiting to be merged that updates the documenttion for this...
</p>
<p><strong>agunde</strong> (Wed, 14 Feb 2018 21:12:44 GMT):<br/>
Thanks! @grkvlt 
</p>
<p><strong>kakuzu</strong> (Wed, 14 Feb 2018 21:13:01 GMT):<br/>
ok i will look into it. thanks
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Wed, 14 Feb 2018 21:13:57 GMT):<br/>
the seth team are working on making this easier, so bear with us for the moment!
</p>
<p><strong>kakuzu</strong> (Wed, 14 Feb 2018 21:15:05 GMT):<br/>
ok, :) it is easy if image was there i just need to deploy contracts on containers.

getting that block-info docker image published is in the queue, should be coming soon

Hi, is there any tutorial on how to extend sawtooth-core with sawtooth-seth? I tried this https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/seth/nightly/master/seth_developers_guide/getting_started.html ,  but sawtooth-seth has been removed from sawtooth-core repository and thus after running the commands $ git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core
$ cd sawtooth-core/
$ ./bin/build_all -t seth -t python

Hi again, I downloaded an older version of sawtooth-core https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/releases/tag/v0.8.10 which contained the seth transaction family. Then, I tried to run the sawtooth-seth.yaml file with docker-compose. I encountered an access denied error when pulling the seth-rpc (see screenshot below).How can I solve this?

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 18:27:42 GMT):<br/>
@anastath we are currently updating the docs to reflect the separation of seth from core. there is a PR from @grkvlt right now to update the docs and compose file - https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/pull/8
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 19:25:18 GMT):<br/>
I updated https://github.com/grkvlt/sawtooth-seth/blob/602616b1dbbeb97bba14d8bb68dc02210ab21dea/families/seth/rpc/src/calls/transaction.rs#L68-L77 with what I think is a better idiom for calling the client from the seth RPC service, but it's a bit more verbose... Can someone check PR #9 again please?
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 19:30:28 GMT):<br/>
@amundson this is an update I made after your last comment on my PR... also, is there any good resource you cam recommend for me to improve my Rust skills?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 21:45:01 GMT):<br/>
@grkvlt I'm still learning Rust myself, and have recently started to really get the functional aspects; I've been reading a lot of Option/Result and trying to chain things together to get the right outcomes, but the example code where I've figured that out isn't open sourced yet. Unrelated to error handling, I really enjoyed this - http://cglab.ca/~abeinges/blah/too-many-lists/book/
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 21:48:21 GMT):<br/>
@grkvlt you have two approvals on https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/pull/9
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 19 Feb 2018 21:50:05 GMT):<br/>
@grkvlt I added an approval on https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/pull/8 but I didn't actually test it, so probably best to get an approval from someone who tests it
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 13:22:23 GMT):<br/>
does anyone here have suggestions how i could debug an issue wth `seth-rpc` that seems to cause it to hang on `eth_getTransactionReceipt` calls from Truffle... looking into it, it seems like a call to `client.get_transaction_and_block(txn_id)` is blocking after sending a `CLIENT_TRANSACTION_GET_REQUEST` message to 0mq (i think, `client.rs` line 397) so maybe i should be looking at the validator code for `sawtooth-core` instead? i'm trying to fix smart contract deployment with Truffle here...
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 19:32:14 GMT):<br/>
heh, it turns out that `CLIENT_BLOCK_GET_BY_TRANSACTION_ID_REQUEST` messages are _NOT_ being handled by the Sawtooth validator! obviously I'm fixing that, and will submit pull requests shortly
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 21 Feb 2018 23:17:11 GMT):<br/>
@grkvlt nice debugging
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 13:26:27 GMT):<br/>
Once https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/pull/10 is merged, it looks like Seth will be usable with Truffle for smart contract deployment - I've started some more intensive testing, but initial checks look good...

<p><strong>kakuzu</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 20:52:22 GMT):<br/>
@grkvlt pls let me know when it's done. Really need to setup environment to move forward with set and sawtooth.

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 20:21:35 GMT):<br/>
Publishing the block-info-tp docker image got delayed waiting for sawtooth 1.0.2 to be tagged. we are going to instead publish a 1.0.1 version ad-hoc so we unblock the seth work.  should appear soon.
</p>
<p><strong>kakuzu</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 20:23:18 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 20:41:04 GMT):<br/>
I'm told that the block info tp is published
</p>
<p><strong>kakuzu</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 20:43:12 GMT):<br/>
ok thanks 
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 20:43:46 GMT):<br/>
in theory, now if we update docker compose file, we don't need to build sawtooth-core to use seth
</p>
<p><strong>kakuzu</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 20:45:03 GMT):<br/>
so i clone the seth from git and run directly docker compose file, all the component will be up
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 20:47:32 GMT):<br/>
if you were to edit the compose file to use the image from hyperledger, yes. we still need to get that change into the seth repo.

My understanding is that the sawtooth-seth:latest image needs to be built from the Dockerfile in sawtooth-seth. I think there is a build script in the repo that does it.
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Sun, 25 Feb 2018 14:49:25 GMT):<br/>
@boydjohnson @kakuzu yes, you need to build `sawtooth-seth` by running the `./bin/build_all` script - i'll give that a check on monday, as I have been using my own Dockerfile up till now for my Seth deployments
</p>
<p><strong>kakuzu</strong> (Sun, 25 Feb 2018 21:40:00 GMT):<br/>
@grkvlt thanks ,when you build do the build all it says seth module missing 
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 15:01:44 GMT):<br/>
so, to build using that PR, try the following:
```
$ git remote add grkvlt https://github.com/grkvlt/sawtooth-seth.git
$ git fetch grkvlt
 * [new branch]      fix/build-dockerfiles -> grkvlt/fix/build-dockerfiles
...
$ git checkout -b fix/build-dockerfiles grkvlt/fix/build-dockerfiles
Branch fix/build-dockerfiles set up to track remote branch fix/build-dockerfiles from grkvlt by rebasing.
Switched to a new branch 'fix/build-dockerfiles'
$ ./bin/build_all
...
```
you should then have the `sawtooth-seth` image in your local Docker instance:
```
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                                     TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
sawtooth-seth                                  latest              ee90e48a3d5c        18 minutes ago      1.64GB
...
```
now try running the compose file, after editing it with the appropriate image and version details:
```
$ docker-compose up
...
```
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Mon, 26 Feb 2018 15:02:30 GMT):<br/>
let me know if that doesn't work for you @kakuzu pls

@mccojo1 if you look at the `build_all` script, it seems to be setting the `$HTTP_PROXY` and `$http_proxy` (plus SSL) variables, does Node.js need some other setting for npm to work? https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/blob/master/bin/build_all#L51-L56
</p>
<p><strong>mccojo1</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 14:43:58 GMT):<br/>
echo real tough the issue was with npm install web3. apparently urls that start with git:// don't get translated correctly from behind a proxy. I had to get around it by adding this to the Dockerfile: RUN git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://

so I finally have sawtooth-seth. but when I run the next step: 

docker-compose -f docker/compose/sawtooth-seth.yaml up 

it complains that:

Pulling seth-tp (sawtooth-seth-tp:latest)...
ERROR: repository sawtooth-seth-tp not found: does not exist or no pull access

</p>
<p><strong>kakuzu</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 14:57:44 GMT):<br/>
yeah its not there in hyperledger . u can try this https://hub.docker.com/r/grkvlt/sawtooth-seth/   or https://hub.docker.com/r/scotcoin/sawtooth-seth-tp/
</p>
<p><strong>mccojo1</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 15:07:53 GMT):<br/>
ok got the scotcoin one... edited the yaml. and now when I try to bring it up:

```Creating compose_validator_1
Creating compose_settings-tp_1
Creating compose_rest-api_1
Creating compose_block-info-tp_1

ERROR: for rest-api  Cannot start service rest-api: invalid header field value "oci runtime error: container_linux.go:247: starting container process caused \"exec: \\\"sawtooth-rest-api\\\": executable file not found in $PATH\"\n"

```
</p>
<p><strong>mccojo1</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 15:11:57 GMT):<br/>
same thing happens when I try to docker-compose up from the sawtooth-seth repo:

```Status: Downloaded newer image for hyperledger/sawtooth-block-info-tp:1.0

<p><strong>mccojo1</strong> (Tue, 27 Feb 2018 15:18:47 GMT):<br/>
ok... using the docker from grkvlt/sawtooth-seth worked I think everything came up but there are some errors. not sure if they're critical. something about a module sawtooth_block_info

How to set up seth development environment?
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Wed, 28 Feb 2018 13:36:15 GMT):<br/>
so, @kakuzu what you are seeing is because the python module for `sawtooth_block_info` cannot be found by the validator - it's referenced in the validator startup command in the compose file - and it's needed by seth.fyi

fyi, @mccojo1 the images for the seth tp you found are mine. the `grkvlt/sawtooth-seth:1.0.2` image is one i have been using in testing; the whole `grkvlt/sawtooth-*`sequence of images with tag `1.0.2` are ones i use for testing, with some minor changes from the main `master` branch. so you can try those but of course, i *cannot* give assurances they won't break on you, while i'm working. the `scotcoin/*` are customised for a client, so less useful.

got it ty. FYI I was trying to follow along in the instructions from : https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/seth/nightly/master/seth_developers_guide/getting_started.html ... obv, as written it doesn't get past the first few steps now that seth is de-coupled from sawtooth-core.

yeah, it won't for now, they are working on it will be updated soon.

i've got a bit to revert on  PR 12 (for copyrights) but i think PR 11 just needs review
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 20:15:37 GMT):<br/>
Ok
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 20:16:25 GMT):<br/>
agree, we'll need to change the documentation appropriately, but if we do the refactor in a branch, it'll help to have master in a usable state for now until it's done

@dplumb @grkvlt Are you both aware of the CI process setup for Seth? https://build.sawtooth.me/job/Sawtooth-Hyperledger/job/sawtooth-seth It doesn't seem to be reporting back to github right now, but we should try to get that setup.

<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Tue, 06 Mar 2018 22:32:07 GMT):<br/>
@adamludvik that's one of the tasks I was hoping to fix this sprint, yes

it turns out that PEM format private keys created as `openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp256k1 | openssl ec -out alias.pem` may have only *31* bytes when converted, causing the `seth account import` command to fail. i think we just need to (left) zero pad the bytes to 32 to fix it, probably in the PEM conversion methods somewhere. i'll make a JIRA about this later, commenting here to make sure it's recorded

<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:46:22 GMT):<br/>
is there any fundamental reason that the `seth-rpc` microservice is written in rust? i know rust gives nice memory safety and mutability properties, but we lose those pretty much immediately when we call into python (sawtooth validator) and go (seth tp) so why not refactor the rpc service into go?
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 17:50:58 GMT):<br/>
seth is a real polyglot of a debugging challenge, with solidity -> javascript -> rust -> python -> go and back, so reducing the number of languages in the middle would be nice, but we can't get rid of go (because of the burrow evm imports) or python (sawtooth core) so it has to be rust ;(
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 19:50:25 GMT):<br/>
We are looking at replacing python overall (this is a long-run item) and so we evaluated json-rpc libraries in both go and rust.  The go implementations available were not really flexible enough, where as the rust library chosen fit our needs better.  Secondly, selecting it allowed us to kick-start the development of the Rust SDK (which is feature complete, now).   I think our experience with Rust, so far, is why we'll be replacing the python code with Rust.

@silasdavis gave an update and had completed a ton of stuff in #burrow so he probably has time this weekend to rewrite it all in rust.  :-D

@pschwarz ok - that makes sense, if you're replacing python with rust that you really do get the nice benefits of the language, so great - it also means the effort I put in to learn more about rust will be put to good use too!

i don't know enough about the burrow evm vs the rust evm impl mentioned above to have an opinion yet, but it may be worth watching?

<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 14:59:22 GMT):<br/>
I'm planning to look into how we can improve the EVM situation in the next couple weeks. Right now we just have the (probably outdated) Burrow EVM code committed in the repo which isn't ideal. I'll definitely take a look at SputnikVM during that assessment 
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 16:43:58 GMT):<br/>
i would really like to implement `eth_call` somehow (execute a smart contract method on the EVM, but do not create a transaction record in the blockchain) in the seth TP, and in my exploration so far this is quite messy, and has also shown some possible issues in the burrow evm impl that may need fixed (dealing with zero ETH transfers, for example, which are required for seth)
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 16:44:34 GMT):<br/>
it also has to be done in a way that doesn't break the sawtooth identity/permissions model
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 16:44:45 GMT):<br/>
which is also hard and/or messy
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 16:44:45 GMT):<br/>
which is also hard and/or messy, and in general not helped by multiple address spaces with different languages for each ;(

Just a quick question - am I left with just Protobuf to design the contract, or can I use the EVM?
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Mon, 19 Mar 2018 17:04:03 GMT):<br/>
You shouldnt have to edit any protobufs to create a new contract - you can create them using Solidity and deploy them using Seth

<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Mon, 19 Mar 2018 17:07:47 GMT):<br/>
@dplumb Thanks again. GETH has a very complex way of deploying. Is it different with SETH? Is there any documentation on how you do it with SETH? 
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Mon, 19 Mar 2018 17:12:06 GMT):<br/>

I just did a docker ps - I dont see a seth container. The containers are seth-cli or seth-rpc or seth-tp. That's probably another documentation change. I did a docker exec -it seth-cli bash. And seth cli works like a charm. :blush:

<p><strong>alexlf</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 10:55:31 GMT):<br/>
any ideas?

yes

<p><strong>alexlf</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 15:06:54 GMT):<br/>
yes, from yesterday
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 15:13:57 GMT):<br/>
Looking into it
</p>
<p><strong>alexlf</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 15:23:08 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 15:26:09 GMT):<br/>
Looks like a CLI parsing issue of some sort. If you add `--nonce=1` to the command you wont get a segfault.

<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 15:49:11 GMT):<br/>
The segfault looks to be caused by the `client.LookupAccountNonce()` method, and that `--nonce=1` is probably not correct. it is a transaction counter for your account so it should increment after each txn
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 15:58:53 GMT):<br/>
If you do `seth show account 976e6b6ae746e1e109b2a177bc3f8495015080bc` it will show account details including a nonce. if you set the nonce argument to that number in your `seth contract create` command that should work for you

@dplumb I restarted the docker containers from yesterday. I was able to deploy the contract.sol. However, it appears that the NODE_MODULES have disappeared. The example with node does not work - it cannot find ethereumjs-abi. I can stop docker-compose and rebuild it. Is there a better way?
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 16:06:18 GMT):<br/>
I think I may have broken something with regard to the NODE_MODULES in my PR. that is next on my list to figure out
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 16:11:50 GMT):<br/>
@dplumb Do you have plans to add solc and vim (or nano) to the seth-cli container? I added solcjs and nano in the container, after I 'bashed' into it.

<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 16:27:01 GMT):<br/>
@DevB I think solc should be in the container in order to compile contracts
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 16:27:23 GMT):<br/>
Not sure about vim or nano. What are you using a text editor for?
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 16:28:53 GMT):<br/>
agree, you should mount a volume from the host with contracts, and edit them externally. but having solc in the image would be useful
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 16:33:15 GMT):<br/>
@alexlf according to the results of your `seth account list` the address of your myalias account is 976e6b6ae746e1e109b2a177bc3f8495015080bc. So if you do seth show account 976e6b6ae746e1e109b2a177bc3f8495015080bc you should get the data for that account

@dplumb Text editor for creating the contracts. I am sure Intel will provide a web interface later :relaxed:
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Tue, 20 Mar 2018 16:42:33 GMT):<br/>
If you create a contract in the container they will only exist as long as that container exists. So I think @grkvlt is right in that we should mount a volume from the host and edit contracts externally.

I have a PR up that makes some improvements to the contract deployment workflow. It mounts a "contracts" volume on the host inside the container for external contract editing, fixes the node-modules issue, and installs solc in the `sawtooth-seth-cli` image

@hanumankumarn Not sure about that timeout issue. Are you sure all of the services were running properly?
</p>
<p><strong>hanumankumarn</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 18:31:12 GMT):<br/>
i am sure all services are running
</p>
<p><strong>hanumankumarn</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 18:33:51 GMT):<br/>
please can you confirm all the services should run then i will check
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 18:55:17 GMT):<br/>
The services are listed in the docker-compose.yaml file. You would have seen an error on `docker-compose up` if something failed to start up
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Wed, 21 Mar 2018 18:55:36 GMT):<br/>
Did the account actually get created?

How to integrate the seth with truffle?
</p>
<p><strong>hanumankumarn</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 12:11:04 GMT):<br/>
and How to integrate the seth with solc?
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 14:47:08 GMT):<br/>
Here is the section in the docs relevant to solc: https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/seth/releases/latest/seth_developers_guide/contracts.html#compiling-contracts
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 14:47:43 GMT):<br/>
I am not familiar with the workflow with Truffle, but I think it is possible at this point. @grkvlt may have more info regarding that
</p>
<p><strong>hanumankumarn</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 14:49:14 GMT):<br/>
i have tried with https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/seth/releases/latest/seth_developers_guide/contracts.html#compiling-contracts but solc is not working
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 14:49:37 GMT):<br/>
@hanumankumarn yes, you should be able to point truffle at the `seth-rpc` endpoint, and compile and deploy most contracts. some things still do not work like the `eth_call` RPC method, and there is not yet any documentation on configuring `truffle.js`
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 14:50:56 GMT):<br/>
you need to unlock the accounts you want to use with the `seth-rpc` endpoint, after creating them, so the service will need to be restarted with `--unlock alias1 alias2 etc` as an argument
</p>
<p><strong>hanumankumarn</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 14:53:08 GMT):<br/>
@grkvlt & @dplumb thank you i will start to integrate seth with truffle
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 14:54:24 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @grkvlt . also there is documentation regarding the RPC specifically in the docs: https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/seth/releases/latest/seth_developers_guide/dapps.html
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 14:57:16 GMT):<br/>
```const Web3 = require('web3');
const web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://10.0.0.1:3030/'));
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    'sawtooth': {
      network_id: '19',
      host: '10.0.0.1',
      port: 3030
    }
  }
}
```
Here is an example `truffle.js` file, replace `10.0.0.1` with the IP address of the `seth-rpc` server/container. Then run `truffle deploy --network sawtooth` or similar...
</p>
<p><strong>hanumankumarn</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 14:58:29 GMT):<br/>
@grkvlt thanks

<p><strong>hanumankumarn</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 15:01:20 GMT):<br/>
@grkvlt Do we want to use any ethereum client like geth or infura?
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 15:02:57 GMT):<br/>
no, you don't need geth as a client, truffle connects directly to the Seth RPC endpoint

</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 15:35:26 GMT):<br/>
whatever the address `seth-rpc` is exporting port 3030 on so probably the docker host vm's IP. find what it is and use it in the `truffle.js` file...
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 15:36:05 GMT):<br/>
you'll need to modify the `seth-rpc` startup command to unlock an account though
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 15:37:11 GMT):<br/>
however i don't think the docker-compose file is set up to handle this yet
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 15:37:52 GMT):<br/>
we have to make some more changes to it to set up a shared volume between the cli, tp and rpc containers, for the account PEM files
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 16:54:47 GMT):<br/>
@grkvlt I am reading your conversation with @hanumankumarn. I was able to deploy with solcjs. That's easier than downloading Truffle. What's been the experience with solcjs?
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 16:56:08 GMT):<br/>
i'm guessing you used solcjs to programmatically compile the contract, then how did you deploy to seth? through the ethereum rpc interface?
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 16:56:44 GMT):<br/>
or was it via the `seth contract` cli?
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 16:57:32 GMT):<br/>
Well, I did a NPM install of solcjs within the seth-cli container and created the .sol file there. It was the seth contract cli - yes.
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 16:58:35 GMT):<br/>
ok, that seems quite simple, yes. the reason i want to use truffle is to be able to run unit tests on my contracts, and manage dependencies (like openzeppelin erc-20 code)
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 16:59:15 GMT):<br/>
then i don't need to rely on any seth specifics to deploy
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 17:01:05 GMT):<br/>
@dplumb @grkvlt By the way folkd, I just downloaded the sawtooth-seth git onto an Ubuntu box 16.0.4. I get a failure during the docker compose up --build. Getting an error: Could not compile `tiny-keccak`. 
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 17:01:36 GMT):<br/>
Excuse the typo - it should read folks not folkd.
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 17:02:08 GMT):<br/>
I was having that issue too. If you are using default settings I think it happens because the vm runs out of memory
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 17:02:33 GMT):<br/>
I created a vm with higher memory and it worked
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 17:04:12 GMT):<br/>
@dplumb Dumb question, I guess - How do you create a vm with more memory?
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 17:05:18 GMT):<br/>
If you are using virtualbox it is an option when you are creating the vm
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 17:05:41 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 17:09:04 GMT):<br/>
Any recommendation on the memory size? I will change the instance otherwise. 
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 17:11:00 GMT):<br/>
I did 4gb. Not sure if you need that much
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 17:11:05 GMT):<br/>
it failed at 1gb for me
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 17:43:53 GMT):<br/>
@DevB i use `t2.medium` or `t2.large` on AWS
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 18:02:18 GMT):<br/>
@grkvlt Thanks. I just took a t2.medium. 
</p>
<p><strong>hanumankumarn</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 18:24:19 GMT):<br/>
@grkvlt  Please can tell where i can find seth-rpc container for replacing ip?
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Thu, 22 Mar 2018 18:35:33 GMT):<br/>
no, you need to find the IP address of the Docker VM _running_ the `seth-rpc` container. That sounds like it'll be your AWS host's IP address. Then, point Truffle at that. Make sure you've unlocked the accounts you want to use with the RPC endpoint, by passing in their aliases to the `seth-rpc` startup command with the `--unlock` flag. These account aliases must have the PEM files for their keys available to the `seth-rpc` server in its `/root/.sawtooth` folder, so you may want to check that first.
</p>

When the documentation for generating the keypair says  "Start up a shell in that container:
*$ docker exec -it seth bash* You should now be logged in as root in the container and your working directory should be /project/sawtooth-core" which container does it mean as long as there are no *seth* containers included?

@hanumankumarn I think the truffle version you are using may be the rogue. Couple of things, which I found does or does not work with truffle. I have downgraded to Truffle 4.0.0 beta. I downgraded as the new version kept giving similar problems as yours. npm uninstall -g truffle && npm i -g truffle@4.0.0beta0.0 (dont remember if it was beta 0.0). On Docker, if you are using 18.0.3, then your docker instance uses your machine IP. If 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0 or localhost does not work, do a ifconfig and obtain the DHCP ip. Also run truffle verbose and see where the error is.   truffle migrate --network sawtooth --reset --verbose-rpc.
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 15:32:23 GMT):<br/>
@hanumankumarn Try running truffle develop and then run migrate --network sawtooth.

@dplumb Which container to use? 
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 20:01:48 GMT):<br/>
`seth-rpc`
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 20:02:17 GMT):<br/>
It says alias not found in data directory
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 20:15:08 GMT):<br/>
Do I have to run seth permissions?
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 20:26:17 GMT):<br/>
It looks like your account has all permissions enabled
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 20:27:52 GMT):<br/>
I just read @grkvlt 's note -you need to unlock the accounts you want to use with the `seth-rpc` endpoint, after creating them, so the service will need to be restarted with `--unlock alias1 alias2 etc` as an argument. Do I need to restart the seth-rpc service? 
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 20:28:26 GMT):<br/>
It worked before. I didnt have to unlock it.
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 20:34:19 GMT):<br/>
Did you read through this section of the docs? You shouldn't have to restart the service as far as I know
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 20:34:22 GMT):<br/>
https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/seth/releases/latest/seth_developers_guide/dapps.html
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 20:37:56 GMT):<br/>
I just read it, it says when starting seth-rpc you need to send the --unlock alias names to it. 
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 20:38:08 GMT):<br/>
Ah yeah I think that is correct
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 20:38:15 GMT):<br/>
Sorry about that
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 20:40:43 GMT):<br/>
Any idea how can I bring seth-rpc down and restart it? I think that should solve it.
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 20:44:34 GMT):<br/>
Change the docker composer yaml file?
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 20:47:27 GMT):<br/>
Nope - does not like it. It brings the seth-rpc container down. 
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 20:52:26 GMT):<br/>
@dplumb I think there is a bug with seth-rpc when it comes to unlocking the aliases. Or perhaps it is looking somewhere else for the aliases.
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 20:55:09 GMT):<br/>
Did you create the alias within the seth-rpc container?
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 20:55:36 GMT):<br/>
if you did it on the seth-cli container, those files wont be available in the seth-rpc container
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 29 Mar 2018 20:57:33 GMT):<br/>
You should be able to kill the process and restart the rpc I believe
</p>

@pschwarz I will log the bug into Jira (Sawtooth Lake). I still have to find why it will not Log me in with the LinuxFoundation ID. I will also put it in Github if that is OK.

If you created your Linux Foundation ID using a Oauth login of some sort, you'll need to add a password to your account.  Unfortunately, Jira doesn't handle the Oauth well
</p>

I noticed that @pschwarz .:relaxed: Yes, the JIRA ticket has been created under Sawtooth Lake.

@DevB thank you i have followed the above steps its working fine but where is the contract address

<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Thu, 05 Apr 2018 13:03:56 GMT):<br/>
@hanumankumarn @DevB hi, i have been working on getting seth integrated with truffle - i'd need to see more information (particularly logs from the running containers) to be of further help. please note that full integration with the ethereum ecosystem is a work in progress, and some things may not yet work properly!
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 05 Apr 2018 20:37:13 GMT):<br/>
@grkvlt I think the problem is more with unlocking the aliases. It seems to be a bug - I have a raised a ticket in Jira. I just cant run seth-rpc --unlock [alias list]
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Thu, 05 Apr 2018 23:48:38 GMT):<br/>
@DevB what's the JIRA issue number? also note that you will need the PEM file for the users key (named as `alias.pem`) stored in `/root/.sawtooth/` folder. you can do this with docker volumes, but the compose files don't implement it yet... to test it quickly, try copying the file manually. oh, and remember `seth init <rest-api-url>` has to be called on any contain er where you wish to use the seth CLI

@grkvlt Looks like some problems have been solved. 

I set the unlock after copying the pem file to the /root/.sawtooth folder in the seth-rpc container - that worked fine

root@60a06d5dce7f:/project/sawtooth-seth/rpc# seth-rpc --unlock alias
Enter Password to unlock alias:
alias unlocked: 65cfa399ecb788912768904d63000625cbf30214

Ran the seth init http://localhost:3030 - worked fine
root@60a06d5dce7f:/project/sawtooth-seth/rpc# seth init http://localhost:3030
Initializing seth to communicate with http://localhost:3030

@grkvlt The Jira ticket is https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/STL-1141. I guess I will close it, since we have a workaround.
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Fri, 06 Apr 2018 13:55:29 GMT):<br/>
@DevB what is the transaction here trying to do? is it creating a contract?
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Fri, 06 Apr 2018 14:39:21 GMT):<br/>
@DevB  i think i see the problem - you must shut down the old `seth-rpc` and start a new one, with `--unlock alias` appended to the arguments - see how the `rpc/comp_seth_rpc.yaml` file does thia

@grkvlt Scenario # 1, When I start with:

alias unlocked: 90e77c172a41dd532831c13ac01ddc7ab9e0418f

When I run the POST, it hangs - just - no response. In fact, I waited for 15 minutes and then ctrl+c-ed

The `seth init` is for the `seth` CLI command to talk to the *REST API*, not the RPC endpoint. So, give it the HTTP URL for your REST API server, probably `http://rest-api:8008` or similar. But it's only needed before you run the `seth account` commands. Also, the `--connect` argument should point at the *validator* endpoint, probably `tcp://validator:4004` - can you try again making sure the RPC server is connecting to the validator?
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Fri, 06 Apr 2018 17:10:27 GMT):<br/>
It did not complain,

seth-rpc --connect tcp://validator:4004 --bind 0.0.0.0:3030 --unlock alias
Enter Password to unlock alias:
alias unlocked: 90e77c172a41dd532831c13ac01ddc7ab9e0418f

I still get a error response back -  { jsonrpc: '2.0', error: { code: -32603, message: 'Internal error' },   id: 19 }
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Fri, 06 Apr 2018 17:13:51 GMT):<br/>
@grkvlt Wait! I take that back, I set the seth init to http://rest-api:8008 and Bingo - it worked.
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Fri, 06 Apr 2018 17:14:47 GMT):<br/>
great. we need to write up some more documentation on the process, so this is helpful
</p>

:smile: Hah! That was quite an ordeal.

@hanumankumarn I guess this solves your Truffle problem. Three steps to nirvana:docker exec -it seth-rpc bash
cp alias.pem /root/.sawtooth/
seth init http://rest-api:8008
seth-rpc --connect tcp://comp-seth-rpc:4004 --bind 0.0.0.0:3030 --unlock alias

Test json
{url: 'http://127.0.0.1:3030', method: 'POST',

@DevB & @grkvlt  Thank you I have followed the above steps its working fine but where is the contract address?

@hanumankumarn can you perhaps upload such long log files to a gist or similar service, and post the link here instead, as it makes conversation difficult
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Sun, 08 Apr 2018 19:22:36 GMT):<br/>
also, are you running the 1.0 validator? `CLIENT_BLOCK_GET_BY_TRANSACTION_ID_REQUEST` was not used in 0.8 so that is the only reason I can think of for the last error message you give. try using the 1.0 docker images, as in the latest `sawtooth-seth` compose files

Anyone knows how to generate the docs using `seth-build-docs`? I didn't see this in the docker-compose.yaml.

@grkvlt @dplumb I am going to merge the maintainers PR shortly. I would like to immediately follow it up with a PR to add @pschwarz and @amundson to the list. They have been involved with the research, design, and development of Seth from its inception. This is evidenced by their regular involvement in code reviews. Additionally, @amundson was the first to meet with the Burrow team and conceived of the original design. Do either of you have any objections to this? We will do the formal vote in the PR that adds them but I just wanted to give you both a heads up.

do we have a bug report filed for that?

I found it. Thanks @dplumb !

<p><strong>TeXnicians</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 00:30:36 GMT):<br/>
@DevB I followed your steps, it shows alias unlocked: xxxx, but hanging there. No output on the server side and not return json. Any suggestions?
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 15:52:43 GMT):<br/>
@TeXnicians You should see the output on your Docker console. The seth-rpc goes into a listen mode after it shows the alias has been unlocked.

<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Tue, 10 Apr 2018 18:55:24 GMT):<br/>
@grkvlt is this similar to the error you are seeing on shutdown? ```thread '<unnamed>' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: "SendError(..)"', libcore/result.rs:945:5```
</p>
<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 17:30:41 GMT):<br/>
I think I fixed it here: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/pull/1565
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 15:41:53 GMT):<br/>
@grkvit @dplumb Is there any documentation on how to setup a multi-clustered validator or multi-node Sawtooth-Seth architecture. Which configuration files are needed? Should this question go to the sawtooth channel? I am more interested in how the smart contract propagates across the network - even some help on how POET synchs the method calls. Any help would really appreciated.
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 17:28:53 GMT):<br/>
@dplumb What are your recommended changes for sawtooth-default-poet.yaml to run 4 different rest apis? Say they are running on 4 different EC2-Tier2-Medium instances. What changes do I need to make to the Yaml file? 
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 17:36:48 GMT):<br/>
What do you mean by 4 different rest apis? I've only used those files for docker-compose, so I'm not familiar with what configuration options you'd need to change if you are using it with AWS. I'd recommend the #sawtooth channel for POET questions
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 17:37:15 GMT):<br/>
or #sawtooth-consensus 
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 17:38:04 GMT):<br/>
these docs may be helpful: https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/app_developers_guide/creating_sawtooth_network.html#
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 17:45:15 GMT):<br/>
I am more interested in how the Smart Contract propagates across multiple nodes. Right now the seth-cli works inside one container. In real life, you will have it dispersed across different nodes. 
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 17:51:58 GMT):<br/>
Right, you could try adding the Seth TP and block info TP to each node in that docker-compose file
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 17:52:10 GMT):<br/>
and add a client to one of the nodes
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 18:01:44 GMT):<br/>
@dplumb Will it be the same docker-compose file for all? I guess I will have to configure the Seth TP separately for each node - Is that right? 
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 18:02:34 GMT):<br/>
That is correct
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 18:03:07 GMT):<br/>
And have ports 8080 kept opened?
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 18:05:17 GMT):<br/>
You only need to connect the TP to the validator, as in the sawtooth-seth docker-compose.yaml file
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 18:08:25 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. I will get back to you with more questions? Incidentally - do you have a diagram?
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 18:10:37 GMT):<br/>
Great! I'm interested to see how it works, I don't know if anyone has tried a multi-node seth network. This may be helpful: https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/nightly/master/_images/arch-sawtooth-overview.svg

<p><strong>mshamory</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 18:56:52 GMT):<br/>
After calling a contract with an alias, an additional address appears in the seth contract list for that alias. Seth account show returns that there is nothing at that address. Is this a bug?
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 20:55:36 GMT):<br/>
@dplumb I have two instances running in AWS. Have ports 4004 and 8008 opened between them. My question is which part of the docker-compose.yaml needs to be changed  - is it sawtooth-validator -vv --endpoint tcp://validator:8800 --bind component:tcp://eth0:4004 --bind network:tcp://eth0:8800 . I dont see any peers.
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 20:58:29 GMT):<br/>
I think you need to expose port 8800
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 21:03:09 GMT):<br/>
Just opened it. Restarted the containers. I see a lot of activity with seth-tp.
</p>
<p><strong>DevB</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 21:11:26 GMT):<br/>
I created an account and unlocked the alias. Should it propagate to the other instance?
</p>
<p><strong>anastath</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 08:13:55 GMT):<br/>
Hi all, do you know when this bug will be deployed to production (https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/STL-1141)? Is there any link with the version in which this bug has been fixed so as to download and deploy it?We currently cannot unlock an account to connect with the rpc server, since "seth-rpc --unlock alias"  responds with "Alias not found in data directory" but we need  to connect with the seth-rpc server since we are developing a dapp and need to submit transactions to the validator through the seth-rpc server in json format. Thank you in advance for your answer!

as per the documentation  https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/seth/releases/latest/seth_developers_guide/getting_started.html
at the github repo https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core
i should find        sawtooth-core/docker/compose/sawtooth-seth.yaml 
unable to find one 
any help which yaml file to use
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 21:44:00 GMT):<br/>
@ShashankChndkr : I am guessing you want one of the docker-compose*.yaml files in https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 21:46:29 GMT):<br/>
Looks like based on the latest docs source, you want docker-compose.yaml in https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 21:47:33 GMT):<br/>
I wonder why https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/seth/releases/latest/seth_developers_guide/getting_started.html doesn't match https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/blob/master/docs/source/seth_developers_guide/getting_started.rst

I used the following steps: 
On sawtooth-seth folder, run $ docker-compose up (or if it is first time) $ docker-compose up --build. When everything is up and running, shell into the container from another terminal
$ docker exec -it seth-rpc bash
Once inside, run the following commands:
1. openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp256k1 | openssl ec -out alias.pem -aes128
2. seth account import alias.pem alias
3. seth account create --nonce=0 --wait alias
```Account created
Transaction Receipt:  {
  "TransactionID": "2a8c3d0e412360962d679b47818022251dab3ed8f957b562c8aaacd5580cb473525f8109b5f886485899e26e9120f74a393ba7b4f35f7e4ed75b61a7424d2372",
  "Address": "bc555571cea00df1b976d5ccec25ae85f2137ce1"
}```
4. cp alias.pem /root/.sawtooth/
5. seth-rpc --unlock alias

then the seth-rpc enter listen mode. 

Then I used another terminal window and run
```curl -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "eth_accounts", "id": 2, "params": []}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:3030
```
it returns:
```{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":["0xbc555571cea00df1b976d5ccec25ae85f2137ce1"],"id":2}
```
Then I compile the smart contract and get the deploy code, and run
```curl -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "eth_sendTransaction", "id": 2, "params": [{"from": "0xbc555571cea00df1b976d5ccec25ae85f2137ce1", "data": "0x606..."}]}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:3030
```
it either hangs or the server shows 
`ERROR  Account with address 'bc555571cea00df1b976d5ccec25ae85f2137ce1' not found.`

@harishperfect so you are trying something for sawtooth-core, right? I think #sawtooth might be a better place to discuss. For this issue, I think you can try to run `setup.py` to install sawtooth_sdk to your machine first.
</p>

@TeXnicians Yeap, I will take it there if I don't get it after running 'setup.py'. Thanks!

@TeXnicians yes, and also make sure only one `seth-rpc` instance is running, and that it is un locked
</p>
<p><strong>grkvlt</strong> (Fri, 20 Apr 2018 15:11:47 GMT):<br/>
oh, and actually you want `seth-rpc --connect tcp://validator:4004 --bind 0.0.0.0:3030 --unlock alias` i believe, where you connect to the *validator* in your sawtooth network...

Is there a workaround for this or do you happen to have a backup of the repository. Many thanks in advance.

Is there a reason that calling a contract increases an account's nonce? It's making things confusing because of the way seth contract list works. It just generates addresses up to the account nonce so it makes it looks like there are more contracts than there actually are.

Hi all, we are developing a Dapp with seth and need to get back to our client the TransactionReceipt of a Contract call Transaction so as to fetch the Return Value of the transaction. The thing is, that when we call the method eth_getTransactionReceipt the result in the response is always null (see screenshot, second point), while the transaction exists, since if we use the seth-cli > seth show recipt <TRANSCATION-ID>(see screenshot, first point), the receipt is returned without any problem. We cannot call the method "eth_getTransactionReceipt" it with function callback either.  Could the problem be in the SETH-RPC web server?

<p><strong>PieterBogemans</strong> (Wed, 16 May 2018 08:51:52 GMT):<br/>
@carla Yes I'm trying to familiarize myself a bit with seth, but the getting started with seth documentation has a command with a script in it that doesn't exist. And the docker-compose.yaml file in github repo of sawtooth-seth gives me the same error you had

@PieterBogemans  i am blocked too

<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Wed, 16 May 2018 14:58:33 GMT):<br/>
We found a fix for it - testing it out and will put a PR up shortly
</p>
<p><strong>dplumb</strong> (Wed, 16 May 2018 14:59:30 GMT):<br/>
Also, if you are going through the seth documentation, you will need to build the docs that are in the repo. There hasn't been a release yet with some updates that were made recently

i saw this too @dplumb and fixed it by building the 1-0 rust sdk as part of the dockerfile, did you do this or did you port the `build.rs` from master?

Seems like this is a known issue. So what should be my steps to fix it now:
1.If you remove like 131 in `docker-compose.yaml` : `seth init http://rest-api:8080 &&
2. Do i also need to update the cargo.toml file. Like replace exixting with :and it needed an edited `Cargo.toml` file too ?https://github.com/blockchaintp/sawtooth-seth/blob/seth-rpc-eth-call/rpc/Cargo.toml#L28

@saptarshijucse @zac this is a known problem and we are working to solve it. You can edit the dockerfile directly and change `RUN cargo install protobuf` to `RUN cargo install protobuf --version 1.4` and it should work.

warning: the `--vers` provided, `1.4`, is not a valid semver version

historically Cargo treated this as a semver version requirement accidentally
and will continue to do so, but this behavior will be removed eventually

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Sun, 03 Jun 2018 05:14:47 GMT):<br/>
I've been looking into this protobuf problem. Fundamentally, it is occurring because sawtooth-core's master branch switch to using protobuf 2.0. So we have two options: 1) make seth build against sawtooth-core's 1-0 branch (Sawtooth 1.0); or 2) upgrade seth to protobuf 2.0.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Sun, 03 Jun 2018 05:15:59 GMT):<br/>
Option (1) would require backporting some of the rust sdk (in particular, at least the build.rs file) to 1-0 branch so we can pull it in via seth's Cargo.toml.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Sun, 03 Jun 2018 05:19:55 GMT):<br/>
Longer-term, we need to remove protobuf from the Sawtooth SDK API so that it is an internal implementation detail. We were already starting to come to this conclusion anyway, but this provides a very concrete example of why it is important.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Sun, 03 Jun 2018 05:36:59 GMT):<br/>
(to be clear, I'm referring to the rust protobuf library  version numbers, not the protobuf  spec version)

That diff would move us in the direction of using the protobuf 2 crate. I haven't had time to test it yet, other than it builds and thus "docker compose up --build" gets further.

new to the chat, @mselimi what do you mean by the account being ERC-20 compatible?
</p>
<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 06 Jun 2018 08:18:38 GMT):<br/>
FWIW, ERC20 is a standard for contracts, not native account tokens. They operate at different levels of an EVM blockchain.

The protobuf issue that caused `docker-compose up --build` to fail has been resolved in master.

<p><strong>joshuaherman</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 15:00:37 GMT):<br/>
can i write a transaction processor and then use seth to extend its abilitites?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 16:02:59 GMT):<br/>
it is not currently possible to interact with arbitrary state outside of a seth contract currently (so for example, work with intkey namespace from a seth contract), because we adhere to the evm rules for state interaction which are contract-local. we would need to add a feature... basically a native (non-evm) contract to provide a bridge, but no one is working on it yet as far as I know. This is one of the reasons we created Sabre (https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/sabre/releases/latest/).
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 16:05:04 GMT):<br/>
if anyone can verify that master now works for them, that would be great, as additional testing to what we have already done
</p>
<p><strong>joshuaherman</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 16:37:18 GMT):<br/>
@amundson oh ok so if i wanted to do what i did above i wouldn't use seth i would just use something like web3 
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 16:38:52 GMT):<br/>
can you explain in more detail what you are trying to do?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 16:39:12 GMT):<br/>
(I might have missed some context)

<p><strong>joshuaherman</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 16:40:07 GMT):<br/>
@amundson sorry i was being vague after a transaction using sawtooth I would like to write some data to a ethereum blockchain
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 16:55:38 GMT):<br/>
sure, if you are just interacting with the public ethereum or such, you would use web3; you can also use web3 with seth via the rpc interface

However,in web3, many functions do not work. maybe address problem. you shoud use this command(https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC). requests module can be option.

@carla "seth command not found". Does your docker-compose-installed.yaml contain proxy build args. See my PR #35 and #36 pending commits  https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/pulls 
</p>
<p><strong>Jasminess</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 17:52:43 GMT):<br/>
@carla you may use "seth" command in "seth-rpc" right? you just  "seth account import malias.pem [want alias]"  in seth-cli. seth-cli make something and seth-rpc can share it. 
</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 18:27:47 GMT):<br/>
so how can i run "seth-rpc --connect tcp://validator:4004 --bind 0.0.0.0:3030" ?
</p>
<p><strong>Jasminess</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 18:45:50 GMT):<br/>
@carla  other problem be solved?  Using docker-compose.yaml.. seth-rpc already bind. 
</p>
<p><strong>carla</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 18:46:46 GMT):<br/>
yes seth-rpc is runing
</p>
<p><strong>cliveb</strong> (Tue, 19 Jun 2018 19:41:58 GMT):<br/>
@carla set-rpc is running as a service, but does it have proxy args in docker-compose-installed.yaml. compare with docker-compose.yaml

@Jasminess Which addresses should I put in from and to? And in place of contract I should put the blob of hexcode that I got when I deployed the contract? I just want to clarify
</p>
<p><strong>Jasminess</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 07:01:09 GMT):<br/>
@NidhiKumari I use like this.  From : unlock account address / to : contract address / data : encoded data($ node
> var abi = require('ethereumjs-abi')
> abi.simpleEncode("function(xx,xx,xx..)", "0x...", "0x...").toString("hex")
...byte array here...)
</p>
<p><strong>hanen</strong> (Tue, 26 Jun 2018 09:27:36 GMT):<br/>
@Jasminess I followed your steps but it did not work for me and then i run "seth init http: // rest-api: 8008" on the cli seth container and it worked well so thank you!

New to Seth and trying to understand some of the functionality. Through sawtooth would I be able to interact directly with the public ledger from my permissioned instance or is it more so that I can deploy contracts I have written in Solidity on the permissioned Sawtooth network I ahve?
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 16:38:13 GMT):<br/>
the latter
</p>
<p><strong>PizzaPolice12</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 16:48:25 GMT):<br/>
@kelly_ Thanks and so I would need to adjust a contract interacting with an oracle on the ethereum blockchain to a seperate oracle I construct on sawtooth?
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 16:49:06 GMT):<br/>
Seth is a way to launch your own private blockchain network with EVM contract functionality
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 16:49:37 GMT):<br/>
if you want to connect it to the public blockchain you would need a contract/oracle on the main chain and on the private chain
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 16:50:41 GMT):<br/>
or if your contract uses an oracle on the main chain then you would need to replicate the oracle for the private chain
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 16:50:45 GMT):<br/>
if that is what you are asking
</p>
<p><strong>PizzaPolice12</strong> (Thu, 28 Jun 2018 16:51:36 GMT):<br/>
Yes I just wanted to confirm the latter

I'm going through the Seth Developer Guide and off to a bad start :( When I run `./bin build_all -t seth -t python` in the Sawtooth core repo I get output saying the seth module was not found. Any suggestions? I'm on the master branch of sawtooth-core if that makes a difference.
</p>
<p><strong>ksolo</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 18:49:23 GMT):<br/>
Here's the link to the docs I'm following: https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/seth/releases/latest/seth_developers_guide/getting_started.html
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 19:05:02 GMT):<br/>
@ksolo: Those docs are outdated. You'll want to clone this repo and run the commands found in `docs/Dockerfile` to generate the updated documentation yourself: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth
</p>
<p><strong>ksolo</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 19:05:43 GMT):<br/>

hello all. nathan aw from Singapore. I was told to ask this question here. am trying to build_all seth but the error Module 'seth' not found is returned
could not find the module seth in the sawtooth-core.
$ git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core
$ cd sawtooth-core/
$ ./bin/build_all -t seth -t python
</p>
<p><strong>nathanaw</strong> (Sun, 01 Jul 2018 14:51:33 GMT):<br/>
please help, please...
</p>
<p><strong>ksolo</strong> (Mon, 02 Jul 2018 02:28:53 GMT):<br/>
@nathanaw I hit the same problem the other day (https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth-seth?msg=m56S5gRfHYWY3Snx4)
</p>
<p><strong>ksolo</strong> (Mon, 02 Jul 2018 02:30:33 GMT):<br/>
The documentation is out dated. If you don't already have Docker installed, get that and Docker Compose (if you're running Linux, it will be 2 separate packages, but the Mac and Windows version everything comes bundled together)
</p>
<p><strong>ksolo</strong> (Mon, 02 Jul 2018 02:31:49 GMT):<br/>
Then follow the instructions in the Dockerfile located in the docs (https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/blob/master/docs/Dockerfile#L21)
</p>
<p><strong>ksolo</strong> (Mon, 02 Jul 2018 02:32:45 GMT):<br/>
When I did this it took quite a long time to build the docker images and get things going, but once the docs were generated following along went much better.
</p>
<p><strong>NidhiKumari</strong> (Mon, 02 Jul 2018 06:24:22 GMT):<br/>
@nathanaw Actually the document is outdated, you can clone from this link
 $ git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth.git
$ cd sawtooth-seth/
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up 
This cmd will build seth and will do yaml up. If you face any interruption in building you can refer to these two pull requests 
https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/pull/38
https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/pull/33
Hope this helps you.

Hi Experts!
I have stuck in Sawtooth, how I can create an account or send transactions? How to see where all transactions stored? I'm working with Sawtooth-Seth, how to deploy some contracts and why to much code wrote in python and rust. How to check that, Sawtooth-Seth is working right with main Sawtooth core repo? 
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Tue, 03 Jul 2018 14:23:22 GMT):<br/>
@Anfimov: You'll want to clone the Seth repo https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth.git and run these commands to build the most recent documentation:
```
docker build . -f docs/Dockerfile -t seth-build-docs
docker run -v $(pwd)/docs:/project/sawtooth-seth/docs seth-build-docs
```
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Tue, 03 Jul 2018 14:24:19 GMT):<br/>
That documentation will have a guide on how create accounts and send transactions

hey guys, I finally was able to deploy the contract. Not exactly sure which change helped but i documented my process in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/thekaleidoscope/8d3c77e7fedb3095f5b79b10810e5253) in case someone gets their help from it instead of repeatedly asking for a same problem here and irritating others. Please feel free to add or remove anything you feel necessary

I tried to integrate truffle and use it for interaction, however the ethAccount list behaves in a non-deterministic way, it sometimes results [] and sometimes gives the account. for similar reason truffle sometime deploys and sometime doesn't. Can someone look at my truffle log and help please. https://gist.github.com/thekaleidoscope/55a01ae048454ce17b3897bb6e4ace83

@rootDistress I had a similar problem(non-deterministic way). 
In my case, edit default.yaml file ... seth-rpc: ... command : | bash -c " seth-rpc -v --connect tcp:validator:9999 --bind 0.0.0.0:9999". 
and then, unlock ... tcp:validator4004 --bind 0.0.0.0:3030. I don't know why but it work. 
and other people solved it like this "seth init http: // rest-api: 8008".

@Anfimov: It looks like you're missing the ZeroMQ library. If you use the Docker-based build process from the docs, installing that library should be handled. Otherwise you'll need to find and install that library

@grkvlt @danintel @kelly_ : I'm taking a look at having the Seth CLI talk to the JSON-RPC API instead of directly to the Rest API. It looks like there's some functionality that the JSON-RPC API doesn't expose - should we have the CLI talk to both the REST and JSON-RPC APIs, extend the JSON-RPC API, or some other solution?

<p><strong>adamludvik</strong> (Mon, 23 Jul 2018 21:38:37 GMT):<br/>
Also @Dan do you have any opinions about this? IMO it probably makes the most sense to minimally extend the JSON-RPC as necessary to enable the existing CLI commands that can't be implemented within the stand Ethereum JSON-RPC spec. These would be given RPC names with a sawtooth prefix like `saw_` or `sawtooth_`.

<p><strong>anastath</strong> (Tue, 24 Jul 2018 14:07:45 GMT):<br/>
Hi all, we are devloping a Dapp using seth-rpc. We use node.js and web3.js.  We downloaded latest seth from here (https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth) and run it with docker-compose.yaml. We deployed a Smart Contract using web3.eth.sendTransaction and then tried to call this contract again using web3.eth.sendTransaction. After each contract call, the transation is processed by seth-tp, BUT a message thread '<unnamed> panicked at 'index 32 out of range for slice of length 0', libcore/slice/mod.rs:785:5 appears.  In the third contract call transaction after the panick message above, seth-rpc exits with code 0 and we can't submit any contact call transactions unless we restart the environment with docker-copose.yaml; however, this is not an efficient solution. Could you please help on how to overcome this?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth-seth?msg=iKu3h8XiA9eMH988n) @rootDistress One thing noticed in your gist documentation is executing the command "seth-rpc --connect tcp://validator:4004 --bind 0.0.0.0:3030 --unlock <alias>". But if we use docker, connect command (except unlock) is already executed in docker compose yaml file while starting the seth-rpc container.  So I tried only with unlock command "Seth-rpc --unlock <alias>".  Though unlock was successful, I also got error "Account with address not found".  So I had to run the command "seth-rpc --connect tcp://validator:4004 --bind 0.0.0.0:3030 --unlock <alias>"  from seth-rpc container shell to make it work.

As the burrow EVM gets more use from downstream projects we wanted to set up a place where your team and the Fabric-EVM team could raise any issues with using the EVM as a library and where we could make sure you all were aware of any changes we've made to the library that are relevant for you as part of our release cycle. Hope y'all will join!

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 11:39:06 GMT):<br/>
I noticed that seth is running on an old copy and pasted Burrow: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/tree/master/burrow/src/burrow - I thought you were depending on Burrow at some point, was I mistaken?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 11:40:43 GMT):<br/>
Anyway you will definitely be missing some fixes etc - it would be better if you could depend on Burrow as a dependency using dep: https://github.com/golang/dep - it will remove any unused code for you so no bloat, but it will be clear to see which Burrow version you are using and will be easier to get updates
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 11:43:23 GMT):<br/>
Happy to help someone work through upgrade - should be fairly minor, some changes around how events are captured from EVM executions
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 11:43:52 GMT):<br/>
Currently you are missing some important opcodes like REVERT

</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 18:33:04 GMT):<br/>
You'll have to enter your password for the key into the RPC service when it boots up. Not great UX unfortunately, but that should be fixed when https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/pull/72 is merged
</p>
<p><strong>ytannus</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 18:33:48 GMT):<br/>
there is another way to create accounts? I'm using `openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp256k1 | openssl ec -out <filename>.pem -aes128` as https://gist.github.com/thekaleidoscope/8d3c77e7fedb3095f5b79b10810e5253
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 18:37:38 GMT):<br/>
If you take off `-aes128`, it won't encrypt the key, and you won't have to enter the key when the RPC service boots up

I have what seems like a very basic question about permissions.  We have multiple developers that we want to be able to work with IBM blockchain, but we cannot figure out how to grant them access to the Starter Edition service we have set up.

This channel is about Hyperledger Sawtooth Seth, which allows you to run Ethereum Virtual Machine bytecode contracts on Sawtooth. I'm not sure what "IBM Blockchain" is, but it sounds like some kind of commercial offering from IBM.

hi @kelly_ & @knkski!
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 20:24:48 GMT):<br/>
It's Ben from Truffle here
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 20:25:04 GMT):<br/>
looks like something changed recently in the `seth` cli - the usage no longer matches the docs
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 20:25:58 GMT):<br/>
the command from the docs is `seth account import key-file.pem myalias` but the new cli wants `seth account import key-file.pem --pass-file pass-file.txt` - doesn't like the `alias` arg
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 20:26:56 GMT):<br/>
and when I run that it seems to be getting a 404 from whatever API it reaches out to (based on the config file it looks to be the usual REST endpoint at `:8080`)
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 20:28:16 GMT):<br/>
@benjamincburns: Until https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/pull/72 is merged and the docs updated, you'll want to use the `seth-cli-go` docker container to run commands from
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 20:28:29 GMT):<br/>
ok, thanks
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 20:30:32 GMT):<br/>
nice, that did the trick!
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 20:31:09 GMT):<br/>
so, first thing that's getting added to my "make truffle better for sawtooth" list is a network setup workflow w/ account creation/generation
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 20:33:01 GMT):<br/>
cool, if you could script that, that seems like it would be really useful to use as integration tests for seth
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 20:35:12 GMT):<br/>
at least, i'm imagining it would be something along the lines of coming up with some basic test cases, and then `truffle compile && truffle migrate && truffle test`?
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 20:35:22 GMT):<br/>
sure thing - it may take a little while until we get 'round to adding sawtooth-specific features, though - the plan is to identify common threads among the chains we want to support and make sure that the truffle workflows for each are as similar to one another as possible, so that'll take some time
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 20:36:13 GMT):<br/>
yeah, without thinking too hard about it I'd imagine there'd be something like `truffle network init` and `truffle migrate-accounts` before that
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 20:36:41 GMT):<br/>
or more likely the equivalent of `migrate-accounts` would be wrapped into something like `network init`
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 20:36:41 GMT):<br/>
or more likely the equivalent of `migrate-accounts` would be ran automatically by the `network init` workflow
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 20:38:24 GMT):<br/>
or maybe there's a way to make it so that it all fits into the existing `migrate` workflow - will need to talk it over with the team for sure
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 20:39:52 GMT):<br/>
right now my goal is to figure out what's necessary to make the existing commands (especially the ones you mentioned) work, if anything
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 20:51:02 GMT):<br/>
is `eth_accounts` supposed to work?
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 20:51:24 GMT):<br/>
I can imagine that being a privacy issue, eh?
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 20:55:36 GMT):<br/>
I think I can work around it with `truffle-hdwallet-provider`, however
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 21:16:09 GMT):<br/>
@benjamincburns: afaik `eth_accounts` is supposed to work - are you saying that it's not working for you, or that is working and you expect that it shouldn't be exposed for privacy reasons?
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 21:17:40 GMT):<br/>
ah, sorry - I got it working
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 21:18:59 GMT):<br/>
I missed the unlock step in the gist that Kelly shared - also I'm not sure if it was necessary, but I also added the volume for the common `~/.sawtooth` directory to the `seth-cli-go` container
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 21:29:13 GMT):<br/>
ok - looks like `truffle migrate` isn't happy because `eth_getTransactionReceipt` doesn't return a `status` flag
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 21:29:37 GMT):<br/>
sure, that works to get up and going for now. part of the changes that https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/pull/72 makes is to eliminate the need for the cli to have local keys
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 21:29:47 GMT):<br/>
that's probably deep into the belly of web3 1.0, however
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 21:29:57 GMT):<br/>
that seems like a good ticket to open
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 21:30:01 GMT):<br/>
yep
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 21:30:44 GMT):<br/>
I saw a note somewhere that said that you'll need to update to the latest EVM from burrow to get the REVERT opcode - I'd imagine `status` is a similar story, as that came along w/ byzantium
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 21:30:46 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 22:10:53 GMT):<br/>
is `eth_call` supposed to be implemented?
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 22:11:15 GMT):<br/>
also looks like I'm getting back `method not implemented` for `eth_estimateGas`, which isn't as important, I think
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Wed, 26 Sep 2018 13:59:39 GMT):<br/>
@benjamincburns: Both of those are currently unimplemented:
https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/blob/master/rpc/src/calls/transaction.rs#L404

@knkski Just noticed that teh volume "sawtooth:/root/.sawtooth" is not mapped in seth-cli-go container in docker-compose.yaml file. without that the keys generated in seth container is not visible in seth-cli-go container. Currently this volume is mapped only in seth-cli container

<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Wed, 26 Sep 2018 19:56:25 GMT):<br/>
thanks for that @knkski - earlier I would have said that `eth_call` support is a major blocker for us, but since `eth_getStorageAt` is implemented, it turns out we likely have some tech in our back pocket which we can probably use to work around lack of support for `eth_call`. I'm going to give that a try this afternoon and I'll report back
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Wed, 26 Sep 2018 20:33:01 GMT):<br/>
looks like the code in question has a bunch of size checks built in and doesn't like the increased block hash size... in the short term (later this afternoon) I'm going to see if I can't just fork the relevant pieces and make the sizes line up, and then if that works I'll probably work on some PRs for the relevant projects (mostly `ethereumjs-*` projects) to make the sizes of various protocol elements configurable
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 17:38:11 GMT):<br/>
brief update - I hacked around the missing support for `eth_call` by using `web3-provider-engine`, which caused me to run into the field size checks I mentioned yesterday. I managed to get around those with some small but relatively drastic changes to a few of our dependencies (`addProperties` in `ethereumjs-util`, most notably). As a result of those changes I now have the beginnings of what will become `truffle-sawtooth-seth-provider`, and with that plus the relevant dependency changes I can successfully run `truffle migrate --network=sawtooth-seth` against a toy project :tada:

</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Sat, 29 Sep 2018 01:43:27 GMT):<br/>
another brief update - I've now encapsulated all of the necessary dependency changes into `truffle-sawtooth-seth-provider`... `truffle migrate` seems to work reliably with the current truffle beta (no modifications to truffle itself were necessary). I've also got the Pet Shop tutorial front end working with the provider, but `truffle test` against sawtooth still isn't working 100% - I'll focus on that next
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Sat, 29 Sep 2018 01:46:13 GMT):<br/>
`truffle-sawtooth-seth-provider` isn't yet published to npm, so I'm afraid you can't try it out just yet, but if people want to give it a go I'll create a temporary repo for it and you can add it as a git dependency. I say "a temporary repo" because I think its final home might be in the truffle monorepo, but I need to confer with the truffle core lead on that, as he might want to keep platform-specific stuff in its own repositories

@knkski Apologies for the late-night message - I assume you'll get to this during normal working hours...

I'm running into a bit of a roadblock... Is there any way to determine that a transaction has been processed but failed due to a runtime error in the vm? 

In Core Ethereum we expect to be able to get back a receipt for transactions which submitted without error, but which suffered some runtime error in the EVM (e.g. `REVERT` opcode... It looks like Sawtooth doesn't give a receipt in this case? `eth_getTransactionReceipt` perpetually returns `null` and the REST api `/receipts?id=...` endpoint comes back with `Transaction Receipt Not Found`. If there isn't any way to determine whether a transaction finished processing unsuccessfully, the best I can do as a workaround is to implement some kind of timeout, but I fear that this will be unreliable and may cause duplicate transaction submissions in cases when the network is busy...

@benjamincburns: I'd expect that you'd be able to get a transaction receipt even if a runtime error were encountered - is there any relevant output from the docker containers?
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 01 Oct 2018 14:03:37 GMT):<br/>
If you've got a shareable reproducible test case, it would be great if you could open a ticket with that
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 01 Oct 2018 14:13:30 GMT):<br/>
@Rexcirus: You'll need to `docker exec` into the `seth-cli-go` docker container to run the commands in the documentation
</p>

<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Mon, 01 Oct 2018 15:58:20 GMT):<br/>
that's the only place I think I was seeing anything - my guess is the TP is considering the batch failed

<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 01 Oct 2018 15:58:54 GMT):<br/>
makes sense. still weird that you're not seeing a transaction receipt

indeed - but if a block is never submitted... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 21:37:01 GMT):<br/>
@jsmitchell it was recorded, but I'm not sure when it'll be posted - I can easily do a quick-n-dirty OBS recording from home though if you want to see how it went
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 21:38:08 GMT):<br/>
it was pretty bare bones, though - I just ran `truffle migrate` - demonstrated that it was working, and then fired up the petshop demo and "adopted" a pet (fires off a single transaction and uses `eth_call` to check whether or not pets in the store are adopted)
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 21:38:14 GMT):<br/>
I didn't really show off any code or anything
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 21:38:44 GMT):<br/>
if you want to take a crack at it yourself the code I used is here: https://github.com/benjamincburns/seths-petshop
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 21:39:22 GMT):<br/>
just make sure to `npx webpack` after `truffle migrate` - and use `npx lite-server` to actually run the demo
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 22:49:19 GMT):<br/>
I think I found the bug (updated the ticket w/ the info) - if there's an error from the `TransactionHandler` we bail early (line 107) before creating the receipt (line 114). https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/blob/master/processor/src/seth_tp/handler/handler.go#L105-L118
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 22:54:12 GMT):<br/>
It looks like the code lumps in pre-execution transaction validation issues (e.g. bad nonce) with VM runtime errors
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 22:56:43 GMT):<br/>
I've barely written any go, but I can take a crack at a PR to fix it... assuming I did fix it, I'm immediately lead to the question of how to indicate transaction failure in the resulting receipt. In Ethereum we have the `status` field (`status: 0x1` means the transaction executed successfully) - is it possible for a transaction processor to add arbitrary fields to the transaction receipt in sawtooth? If so, it seems like that'd be a good thing to have.

I actually started looking into that, but it seems I'd have to edit all the protobuf definitions as well - I wasn't sure whether there was one authoritative source for them or not - if there was, I couldn't find it :-/

I've submitted [a PR](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/pull/77) for the above mentioned changes. I also added the missing `from` and `to` fields to the `SethTransactionReceipt` to make it more compatible with Core Ethereum's `eth_getTransactionReceipt` output. Sadly this still doesn't fix `truffle test`, but it's definitely a step closer.

As of that PR, the only field missing from Seth's transaction receipt as compared to [Core Ethereum's transaction receipt](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#example-31) is `logsBloom` - I'll see about adding that tomorrow.

@benjamincburns: Awesome, looks like there's just a small formatting fix then:
```
Incorrect formatting: /project/sawtooth-seth/processor/src/seth_tp/handler
Do 'run_go_fmt fix' to fix
```
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 15 Oct 2018 14:09:53 GMT):<br/>
@Dvi 19: Yeah, that's what seth is currently based on, so if you run the commands locally from the dockerfile of whichever service you're interested in running, it should work
</p>

Looks like I have one or more test failures, but I keep running into issues getting tests to run locally... seems like the protobuf generation step is  getting skipped for some reason?

it looks like the hang actually [happened on Jenkins as well](https://build.sawtooth.me/job/Sawtooth-Hyperledger/job/sawtooth-seth/job/PR-77/6/), but then [a subsequent build](https://build.sawtooth.me/job/Sawtooth-Hyperledger/job/sawtooth-seth/job/PR-77/7/) mysteriously didn't hang :-/

<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Wed, 24 Oct 2018 19:22:19 GMT):<br/>
ok, I think I figured out the nonsense with the protobuf file generation, the lines I mentioned above in the  `.dockerignore` file should be `**/src/messages/*.rs` and `!**/src/messages/mod.rs`, respectively
</p>
<p><strong>benjamincburns</strong> (Wed, 24 Oct 2018 19:22:57 GMT):<br/>
I'm guessing it's behavior that has changed in recent (or not recent) docker versions, because it doesn't seem like Jenkins has any trouble with this

<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Wed, 24 Oct 2018 20:32:07 GMT):<br/>
when the hang happens for you locally, is there output from the `comp-seth-rpc` container? I'm not seeing any output from it in the failed Jenkins build
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Wed, 24 Oct 2018 20:34:17 GMT):<br/>
It's possible that the building of the container takes too long, and forces `seth-rpc` to time out. if you can reproduce it locally, does it help to add `depends_on:\n      - comp-seth-rpc` to the `seth-rpc` container in `rpc/comp_seth_rpc.yaml`?

</p>
<p><strong>Dvi 19</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 14:24:29 GMT):<br/>
I have the seth-transaction processor running
</p>
<p><strong>Dvi 19</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 14:24:49 GMT):<br/>
must I have also the seth-rpc running in all my nodes?
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 14:33:28 GMT):<br/>
@Dvi 19: If you use the Go CLI, you won't need the RPC server running, as it talks to the rest api. Otherwise, you will need the RPC service running
</p>
<p><strong>Dvi 19</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 14:34:56 GMT):<br/>
so seth-rpc is not mandatory
</p>
<p><strong>Dvi 19</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 14:36:42 GMT):<br/>
is this the go-cli? https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/tree/master/cli-go/src/seth_cli/cli
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 14:36:59 GMT):<br/>
yeah
</p>
<p><strong>Dvi 19</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 14:38:29 GMT):<br/>
there are two folders inside (client and cli)
</p>
<p><strong>Dvi 19</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 14:38:37 GMT):<br/>
what are the differences?
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 14:39:03 GMT):<br/>
`cli` is code related to parsing CLI arguments, `client` is code related to talking to the Rest API
</p>
<p><strong>Dvi 19</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 14:39:12 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>Dvi 19</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 14:40:28 GMT):<br/>
any documentation about this cli is available?
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 14:42:57 GMT):<br/>
The best documentation is either reading the source, or doing `seth --help`. There's documentation here, which is just a dumped version of passing in `--help` to all of the seth subcommands: https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/seth/releases/latest/cli_reference.html
</p>
<p><strong>Dvi 19</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 15:01:24 GMT):<br/>
how can I get the binary of seth to run commands?
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 15:02:31 GMT):<br/>
adapting the commands from the dockerfile will be your best bet: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/blob/master/cli-go/Dockerfile

<p><strong>Dvi 19</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 15:51:55 GMT):<br/>
what is the "gas" used for in sawtooth seth?
</p>
<p><strong>Dvi 19</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 15:52:01 GMT):<br/>
is it unlimited?
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 17:47:48 GMT):<br/>
@Dvi 19: It is limited, to prevent endless loops, but you can set it to an arbitrary number by passing in `-g NUM` to the CLI commands
</p>
<p><strong>Dvi 19</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 21:48:26 GMT):<br/>
Gas is only used to create contracts? 
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 21:52:16 GMT):<br/>
In ethereum, gas is used to pay for the execution of contracts. In addition to creating an economic cost for using the resources of other people's computers, deterministic halting of a contract after a fixed amount of resource is spent is a very nice characteristic. For seth, we have a overall platform gas limit per contract.
</p>
<p><strong>Dvi 19</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 22:05:26 GMT):<br/>
What happens when gas is 0?
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 22:11:56 GMT):<br/>
no contracts would run?
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 22:12:25 GMT):<br/>
i don't believe 0 == unlimited
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 22:12:41 GMT):<br/>
that's undesirable anyway

one related comment that doesn't belong on that PR
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 12:24:07 GMT):<br/>
have you considered supporting sendRawTransaction?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 12:25:15 GMT):<br/>
this would be a pain no doubt since you'd have verify in secp256k1 and so have a way of storing that public key against an account then deserialise in RLP
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 12:25:42 GMT):<br/>
but when I've thought about this in the past for Burrow it would be doable (though we do support secp256k1 natively - perhaps you do too?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 12:26:11 GMT):<br/>
given your web3 support is getting pretty fleshed out supporting this call would allow you to interact with client-side wallet implementations like metamask
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 13:39:23 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 13:41:11 GMT):<br/>
I haven't really yet delved into it to figure out how much work it would be, but yeah it would be nice to support sendRawTransaction
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 13:42:11 GMT):<br/>
The signing library supports secp256k1, so that shouldn't be too difficult
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 02 Nov 2018 18:51:18 GMT):<br/>
yeah, thanks for review! our signing library(ies) handles secp256k1 natively so doesn't seem like that would be a stumbling point. All of our 'traditional' transaction families require native signing.

Could not connect to your Ethereum client. Please check that your Ethereum client:
    - is running
    - is accepting RPC connections (i.e., "--rpc" option is used in geth)
    - is accessible over the network

Greetings all - I'm having a lot of difficulty after the update from 3 days ago. If I create a password -encrypted keyfile.pem and attempt to unlock the alias when binding my seth-rpc to my validator node, it returns the error that "A password is required for encrypted keys!" but fails to ever prompt me for the password; and when I tested a keyfile.pem without password, it fails to find the account/address altogether.

@Ceit_E: Can you post the RPC command that you're running?
</p>
<p><strong>Ceit_E</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:02:34 GMT):<br/>
I'm using the command from the documentation:
```
seth-rpc --connect tcp://validator:4004 --bind 0.0.0.0:3030 --unlock myAlias
```

</p>
<p><strong>Ceit_E</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:05:05 GMT):<br/>
I also had to edit the docker-compose.yaml to add "- sawtooth:/root/.sawtooth" to the seth-cli-go volumes, as otherwise the .pem created there isn't visible to the other containers.
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:11:18 GMT):<br/>
@Ceit_E: you'll need to either pass in the `--pass-file` argument along with the `--unlock` argument, or pass in both when making the unlock RPC call
</p>
<p><strong>Ceit_E</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:11:59 GMT):<br/>
Okay. Can the documentation please be updated to reflect that?

Could you give me an example of the full syntax using --pass-file? I'm getting this error when trying to include it with the unlock command above:

```
error: Found argument '--pass-file' which wasn't expected, or isn't valid in this context

```
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:45:56 GMT):<br/>
sorry, it looks like you can't specify a pass file when starting the RPC service, but you should be able to run `seth-cli account unlock` and pass in the account name and pass file to unlock the account
</p>
<p><strong>Ceit_E</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 17:02:50 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 17:21:55 GMT):<br/>
you'll want to run it from the `seth-cli` container, and it probably needs to get built first. you can use `cargo` to run it, which will ensure that it's built: `cargo run -p seth-cli account unlock`
</p>
<p><strong>Ceit_E</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 17:38:20 GMT):<br/>
It was built with the initial `docker-compose up --build` command, and is running. I can `docker exec -it seth-cli bash ` into it, but get the same error there as above:
```
bash: seth-cli: command not found
```

</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 17:49:21 GMT):<br/>
Try running it with `cargo run -p seth-cli account unlock`
</p>
<p><strong>Ceit_E</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 17:52:04 GMT):<br/>
```
Error: invalid type: integer `404`, expected struct JsonRpcResponse at line 1 column 4
```
</p>
<p><strong>Ceit_E</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 17:54:19 GMT):<br/>
What was the reason for removing the password prompt when running the original unlock command from `seth-rpc`?
</p>
<p><strong>Ceit_E</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 17:57:45 GMT):<br/>
I ask because I've just spent the past three weeks putting together a workshop and demo for a hackathon this past weekend. I was working with the previous version of Seth, and my attendees cloned the current version for their environment setup. We discovered the issue when it became apparent that the workshop was now pointless and no one was going to be able to build their hackathon prototypes using Sawtooth-Seth in its current state. 

Somewhat disappointing...
</p>
<p><strong>Ceit_E</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 18:21:32 GMT):<br/>
That `404` is coming from the `rest-api`
```
seth-cli-go      | Initializing seth to communicate with http://rest-api:8080
rest-api         | [2018-11-19 17:51:27.310 INFO     helpers] POST / HTTP/1.1: 404 status, 172 size, in 0.000412 s
```
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 18:24:21 GMT):<br/>
@Ceit_E: For workshops and demonstration purposes, you can just use unencrypted keys, which won't have this issue. Otherwise, that error looks like you may need to configure the path to the RPC API for seth-cli (it shouldn't be talking to the rest-api at all)
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 18:25:12 GMT):<br/>
something like this: `cargo run -p seth-cli config init --url http://seth-rpc:3030/`
</p>
<p><strong>Ceit_E</strong> (Mon, 19 Nov 2018 19:30:33 GMT):<br/>
Great, thanks so much! It's almost working. I'm getting an "account not found" error now, and running `seth account list` multiple times will return `[]`  two times out of three, but I'll keep poking at it.

</p>

I am following this 
https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/seth/releases/latest/getting_started.html
Initially, it was working fine. When this error was coming, there were no logs in Docker containers for transaction processor, it may be the issue with tp. Now I have restarted containers and its working fine.

@knkski @Dan If the client is running, I am getting this error after some time(don't know exact time) for every transaction I run. transaction returns timeout instantly they are fired.
`Error: Problem submitting account creation transaction: Transaction was submitted, but client timed out before it was committed.`
Is there anything I need to update or something. I am getting this error while this command now, earlier it was while creating account:

Hi I have an error with only one google result and no one has offered a solution. I only know that one person in Korea has the same problem:
 Environmental details (virtual, physical, etc.): 12 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, Docker 18.0.3
    Reproduction: run $ docker-compose from the sawtooth-seth folder (or the first time) $ docker-up up --build. If everything works fine, run $ docker ps to get the container ID for seth-rpc. Shell in container at another terminal
    $ docker exec -it seth-rpc bash
    Run the following command once.

    openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp256k1 | openssl ec -out alias.pem -aes128
    Get Seth account alias.pem alias
    Create seth account --nonce = 0 - Wait alias
    Ask for password
    At this point, you want to unlock the alias to start seth-rpc.
    seth-rpc --unlock alias
     
    Actual Result: An error occurs. - Alias ​​not found in data directory.

    Expected Result - You must unlock the alias.

@Dvi 19: yeah, it is possible to call another contract from a contract, you'll want to make sure that contract chaining is enabled

<p><strong>Dvi 19</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 16:10:29 GMT):<br/>
@knkski using sawtooth transaction processors, you can set the payload of a transaction
</p>
<p><strong>Dvi 19</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 16:10:40 GMT):<br/>
is this possible using seth?

Now, I want to use smart contracts instead of transaction processors
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 16:17:41 GMT):<br/>
@Dvi 19: You wouldn't want to directly set the transaction payload like that. A Seth payload is a protobuf-serialized SethTransaction: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/blob/master/protos/seth.proto#L57
</p>
<p><strong>Dvi 19</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 16:18:22 GMT):<br/>
So, I cant personalize my payload?
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 16:19:45 GMT):<br/>
you could manually personalize the payload and submit a regular sawtooth transaction to the sawtooth rest api, but seth wouldn't then understand the transaction you send it
</p>
<p><strong>Dvi 19</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 16:20:13 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 16:21:42 GMT):<br/>
if you're building on top of seth, you will want to use smart contracts, and have "transfer" be a contract address, and "200 account1 account2 26-11-2018" be arguments to the smart contract
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 16:22:48 GMT):<br/>
and you'll want to use "seth-cli contract call" to call the contract
</p>

thanks @knkski . I am developing a simpleWallet application using smart contracts. I wan to store all my actions (deposit, transfer) in a relational database. So, imagine that I delete all the data in this relational database and I would like to rebuild this transactions database. Is it possible to read the seth transactions and get the action (deposit or transfer) executed in the smart contract?

<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 17:26:24 GMT):<br/>
@Dvi 19: You'd want to go through each sawtooth transaction and parse the payload as a `SethTransaction`, then filter to only `MessageCallTxn` transaction types, and parse the `data` field as ethereum abi-encoded arguments, i.e. the reverse of the process listed at the bottom of this page: https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/seth/releases/latest/contracts.html
</p>
<p><strong>Dvi 19</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 18:18:26 GMT):<br/>
thanks @knkski , so in seth there is not easy way to have a list of smart contracts executed with it parameters
</p>
<p><strong>Dvi 19</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 18:19:34 GMT):<br/>
this is the function for encoding (for example)
abi.simpleEncode("set(uint,uint)", "0x13", "0x2a").toString("hex")

but what would be the function for "decoding"?
</p>
<p><strong>Dvi 19</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 18:20:25 GMT):<br/>
Could I use this? https://github.com/ConsenSys/abi-decoder
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 18:20:56 GMT):<br/>
you should be able to use the same library listed in that documentation, and call `abi.simpleDecode`
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 18:21:17 GMT):<br/>
the link you sent would probably also work

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth-seth?msg=sZFQ4GHHX5kYTvh9F) @ra_w This usually happens if you did not have `--wait` on the command line, so the client to wait for the commit response.

Another thing you can do is check that all the client services are running (listed in the docker-compose.yaml file if you are using Docker).

<p><strong>Dvi 19</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 19:21:36 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 19:38:54 GMT):<br/>
@Dvi 19: the data parameter of simpleDecode is an encoded argument list generated by simpleEncode (or compatible functions). So you could do something similar to this: `abi.simpleDecode(abi.simpleEncode("set(uint,uint)", "0x13", "0x2a").toString("hex"))`
</p>
<p><strong>knkski</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 19:39:32 GMT):<br/>
Otherwise, you'd pass it the contents of the `data` field in a `SethTransaction`

Hi,
</p>
<p><strong>sumit199504</strong> (Tue, 27 Nov 2018 09:24:56 GMT):<br/>
I am facing an error in seth. I have created an account in seth-cli-go container, which gave me my account address. After that in seth-rpc container, I am trying to unlock the created alias using the following command:   seth-rpc --connect tcp://validator:4004 --bind 0.0.0.0:3030 --unlock myalias. It is showing an error as follows: Alias not found in key directory. I have started the seth-rpc and conntected it to the validator in 4004 by binding with port 3030 as was mentioned in the docs. Please help.

Can you please show how you are creating alias in "Seth-rpc" container? The command as per docs is:    "seth account import key-file.pem myalias". On executing this command in seth-rpc, we are getting the error: seth:command not found.  Also, I have fixed the unlock account problem by making some changes in the .yaml file. My alias is successfully getting unlocked. But on sending eth_sendTransaction(from:"", data: ""), it is showing an error:  Account with address `{address}` not found.     ERROR  AccountLoadError.

@anastath in your photo example above, you're shelling into "seth-rpc-0" - where is this container defined? The standard rpc container that I'm getting from the current version of sawtooth-seth is simply "seth-rpc", and modifying the docker-compose.yaml file as per your suggestion above merely causes the "bash: seth: command not found" error to be returned when docker-compose initially builds the containers.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth-seth?msg=W7E8euHXRgSxPN6wQ) @sumit199504 As of now, you need to copy the pem file(with alias name present in /root/.sawtooth/keys) to file named with your address(i.e, here 0x4c365a80c436e4e731b17641c1eaed192c880b3f.pem) because the code tries to load the file with that name and is not able to locate it.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth-seth?msg=sefgDRPoKwmMA4Txz) @fahad.suhaib my mistake, you also need to call the method "personal_unlockAccount" using curl...
For example, 
curl -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "personal_unlockAccount", "id": 2, "params": ["0xf010502daad9a6bc1cef0ad28c4d38a6590fea65", "None", 0]}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:3030

i think --unlock does nothing

you can run the docker container on your local machine and then docker exec into it. Once you get into the container, try linux command "which seth", then it will print out the binary file path

`contract a {

When I deploy this contract it sets the owner to the deployed contracts address. But instead it should be the address I am using to deploy the contract.

Can anyone please tell me error I may be committing or what is the workaround this?

<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Sun, 09 Dec 2018 20:32:21 GMT):<br/>
The byte code is what is stored. The source code is not stored on chain. You can retrieve the byte code from reading the state at the contract address.

Hi. I have a smart contract that has some functions that return some values. I want to call these functions (and don't want to post transaction). On Ethereum mainnet, I can do this using JSON-RPC API "eth_call". But I know that support for eth_call is not available in seth. So how can I call contract functions in seth? eth_sendTransaction will post transaction. But I don't want to post transaction, I just want to execute my contract code in EVM and get return value. Is this possible? Thank you so much for the help.

Hi Seth... I wanted to share a project that @seanyoung has started that I think has a lot of potential to grow into something rather interesting. It is a solidity-to-LLVM compiler using modern compiler tooling to generate LLVM IR with an antlr grammar: https://github.com/seanyoung/solang. What we (Burrow) have in mind is using the LLVM WASM backend to create a migration path for existing solidity code and also thinking about WASM-EVM interop within Burrow that can bring with it a host of advantages. With the sawtooth team's work on Sabre and the supply chain project's state aim of developing for some kind of WASM target I think this is potentially very interesting for sawtooth and hyperledger. We don't have full time resources to throw at this but I'd be interested to hear if anyone is interested in working on it. Our intention would be to propose this as a labs project.

might be interesting for Sabre. to add support for solidity, but also potentially storing source on-chain and compiling as needed (for reviewability of the smart contract)

You could even compile it to the native cpu then, and get a huge speedup.

</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Mon, 07 Jan 2019 19:43:21 GMT):<br/>
@jsmitchell just thinking this through. Would that mean that smart contract creation would include 1) solidity source code 2) compiled wasm code 3) commit id of solang + llvm, and then the contract would only be accepted if the wasm code can be verified (and solang/llvm is not banned for e.g. a bug)?
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Mon, 07 Jan 2019 19:44:30 GMT):<br/>
or would you imagine that verification happens offline?
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Mon, 07 Jan 2019 19:53:26 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure if the 'store contract' transaction would attempt the compilation to verify the submitted bytecode. I guess it could, which might be cool. Having a reproducability guarantee from the toolchain would allow the flexibility to do this in a bunch of places. This is a much hairier problem in the rust->WASM case given the complexity of the toolchain and the number of libraries/packages likely involved.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 08 Jan 2019 11:20:44 GMT):<br/>
A solidity contract can call other contracts, so the bytecode depends on the source for those external contracts. Also solidity contracts can be a concrete contract for a series of abstract contracts, in which case the bytecode again depends on the solidity for those abstract contracts. Not quite as bad as rust, I guess.
We could have -deps options which produces the same output as "clang -MD -c foo.c", i.e. a list of source dependencies for each contract.

Hello Team, how is data stored in sawtooth seth? This is, I have an smart contract that stores an array that is growing (using push function). When I push a new objet in the array, where is it phisically stored? in a block? or all the array is stored in the smart contract address?
</p>
<p><strong>Dvi 19</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 10:45:59 GMT):<br/>
What is recommended to store large arrays?
</p>
<p><strong>Dvi 19</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 10:53:15 GMT):<br/>
do they have a limit (in length)?
</p>
<p><strong>Dvi 19</strong> (Thu, 31 Jan 2019 11:16:47 GMT):<br/>
the contract storage is distributed in the blocks?

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 18:00:18 GMT):<br/>
re:storage - each contract has local storage stored with the contract (because that's how it works with the EVM), and that pair is stored in a leaf node of the Merkle-Radix tree within sawtooth
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 18:01:31 GMT):<br/>
blocks contain transactions which are used to modify state; so if you submit a transaction to make a change, that is stored in a block, but the state that is changed is not. the block has a merkle root hash pointing to the correct resulting tree after the block is published
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 18:03:31 GMT):<br/>

I cloned sawtooth-seth repo and ran docker-compose-installed.yaml with DISTRO=xenial.  When I ran command "seth account import key-file.pem myalias", it is throwing error:

root@f38b5288cd8d:/project/sawtooth-seth# seth account import key-file.pem myalias
error: Found argument 'myalias' which wasn't expected, or isn't valid in this context

USAGE:
    seth account import [OPTIONS] <key-file>

For more information try --help
root@f38b5288cd8d:/project/sawtooth-seth#

If I run command without myalias, it gives me error:
root@f38b5288cd8d:/project/sawtooth-seth# seth account import key-file.pem
Error: JsonRpcError { code: -32069, message: "Private key must be hex-encoded" }

Hello, sorry if this is a simple question. I'm trying to go through the docs, cloned the repo and try to run docker-compose up --build, when building seth-sli-go, get this error:

I've looked around and seen general solutions for that usr/bin/*... error but still am not sure how to proceed in this case.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth-seth?msg=PQSpd3CPE3oGz36cC) @ed2dword This is a WIndows/Linux file compatibility issue.  Windows uses two characters for the end of line, `\r\n`, while UNIX/Linux uses one, `\n`. There are various ways of handling it, including editing the Docker file to remove the Windows-specific `\r` characters. Consider running Docker inside a VM running Ubuntu 16 LTS. I use VirtualBox, due to it's ease of use and flexibility, but you can also use Microsoft Hyper V, which comes with Windows 10 (but needs to be enabled and installed).

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth-seth?msg=vGyrg2jKGrKwd7eZW) @danintel Thank you for your response. I noticed the issue but I wasn't too sure what exactly I would've needed to convert. Ended up re-cloning the repo with `--config core.autocrlf=input` flag and that seems to suffice for now. Will definitely look into switching to VM running Ubuntu.

@danintel  How can we create accounts using sdk? and how can we interact or deploy smart contracts from external accounts(not created in sawtooth-seth)? 
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 16:46:25 GMT):<br/>
 I would clone the version from Dec. 14, 2018.
https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/commit/0a409f333ed6311e3c65f4e6101accb2d438487f
I know there are separate Xenial and Bionic Docker files, but my guess is it's broken for Xenial.  The current source is really only tested on Bionic. Going back to Dec. 14, 2018 would be safer.

I think the user must unlock it account in the client, not in the rpc

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth-seth?msg=apWAHAnPsKtmCynD3) @ed2dword @ed2dword, I also got the same 'python3\r' error. I used `--config core.autocrlf=input` but then stumbled upon another Error.

@danintel Thanks for sharing the root cause.

For me the below mentioned solution worked. I used the below mentioned utility to convert windows line breaks to Linux Line Breaks.

Note - I used cmder FULL version (https://cmder.net/) to run this. This command won't work on windows Command Prompt or Windows Power Shell

git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth.git
cd sawtooth-seth\
for /R %G in (*.*) do dos2unix "%G"
docker-compose up --build

Hope this helps !

@lin2xing The Docker compose file is broken with Seth for Sawtooth 1.1. I just created PR#96 with a fix:
https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/pull/96
It is in review and will take several weeks for review and integration and the next release, so you can copy over the above changes manually for now.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth-seth?msg=tpftpNtu6ubrWYf7m) @Dvi 19 That is strange. I was able to build the the docker image and it found those packages. If you are behind a proxy, you need this fix: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/pull/95
Otherwise I do not know. Maybe there was network problems.

Error: Problem submitting account creation transaction: invalid character '<' looking for beginning of value```
</p>
<p><strong>kodonnel</strong> (Tue, 26 Mar 2019 14:34:56 GMT):<br/>
I've not seen that error, but seeing as how it is '<' it is complaining about, and that's really the first step where you actually contact seth, I'd maybe double check quickly for a proxy problem or similar. 
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Tue, 26 Mar 2019 15:24:42 GMT):<br/>
I Googled it and the  "invalid character '<'" problem seems to be related to a parsing problem parsing `<null>`. This occurs when a new field is added, but not set to a value.
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Tue, 26 Mar 2019 15:26:02 GMT):<br/>
It's pretty obvious that the latest changes to Seth were just made but never tested, since it does not work out-of-the-box. So I am going to try older commits back to pre-Sawtooth 1.1 and see if that works OK.

<p><strong>kodonnel</strong> (Tue, 26 Mar 2019 19:42:16 GMT):<br/>
main thing that jumps out at me as related is the switching to SDK 0.2 and from 1.0 to nightly
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 20:19:14 GMT):<br/>
Seth works when a proxy is not required (at least with Sawtooth 1.0 and older changeset a409f3). This command fails when inside a corporate proxy, due to some behind-the-scenes network request: `seth account create --nonce=0 --wait myalias`
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Wed, 27 Mar 2019 21:24:47 GMT):<br/>
When I run seth with the current changeset (which runs Sawtooth 1.2 nightly + Ubuntu 18 (Bionic), `sawtooth-validator` panics when I run this step: `seth account create --nonce=0 --wait myalias`
The issue I filed is https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/STL-1509

So the moral of this story is use the older changeset I mention above, even outside of a corporate proxy. Otherwise, Seth will not work.

I have no fix. The problem is basically the latest changeset does not work, even when running on Internet with no proxy required.
THe workaround is to roll back seth to changeset 52a0512 (Disable clippy warning about not returning Self).
This forces seth to run docker-compose with Ubuntu 16 (Xenial) and Sawtooth 1.1.

Hello, I am trying to get Seth up and running using docker-compose as per the documentation here (https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/seth/releases/latest/getting_started.html). However, when I get to the point of creating a new account, my rust-engine-devmode panics and exits with code 101, and the validator exits too. Is this a known bug? Prior to the last update I was facing the connection timed out bug while trying to create accounts

@danintel 
The function of *SetStorage* here https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/blob/master/processor/src/seth_tp/handler/sawtooth_app_state.go has a bug. When you make transactions it gets all the state, append the new entry and rewrite all the state again, plus it has a defer function with a useless for loop with a debug logger that logs everything. Now if you have transactions of let's say bytes(something that is dynamic), some time the hard drive is going to be full. When you make a down/up to the containers the disk returns to it's starting point...... The information is there because of the volume usage.

@MarLu96 The problem is you are using the latest version of Seth, which is broken--it does not work.  The workaround is to roll back Seth to changeset 52a0512 (Disable clippy warning about not returning Self). This forces Seth to run docker-compose with Ubuntu 16 (Xenial) and Sawtooth 1.0.
The issue I filed is https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/STL-1509

<p><strong>ltseeley</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:37:13 GMT):<br/>
@danintel @MarLu96 @ra_w @lin2xing the issue with seth account creation has been resolved on the master branch of sawtooth-core: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/pull/2064
</p>
<p><strong>ltseeley</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:38:32 GMT):<br/>
There is currently a PR up to backport the fix to 1.1 as well. Ideally we'll get a bugfix release for 1.1 that includes this fix out soon.

@MarLu96 I haven't seen the error ``No batch status link returned!` before. Looking at the source, https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/blob/master/cli-go/src/seth_cli/client/client.go
I see it looks like some unexpected error from submitting the transaction.

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 30 Apr 2019 14:36:46 GMT):<br/>
@IvanTyulyandin the transaction processor code is a pretty good guide for that if you are looking for something technical. at a high-level, yes, we are only using the evm. we setup state for it, make a call, then observe the results. that's melded w/Sawtooth. Sawtotoh provides the consensus and database (global state).

hi, I'm trying to understand why eth_call is not implemented by seth-rpc. The code comment says "Implementing this requires running the EVM, which is not possible within the RPC." Why not just forward it in the same way as for eth_sendTransaction ? Studying the seth-go client appears to show that both state changing and "view" or "pure" contract functions are handled by simply sending MessageCallTxn to the tp. If thats true, why isnt eth_call implemented similarly to sendTransaction ?
</p>
<p><strong>konsmosc</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 14:04:19 GMT):<br/>
First you have to understand why when you send a transaction seth-tp rewrite the whole state of the chain. So the not implemented eth_call is not the only problem. In any case instead of eth_call you can use again the eth_sendTransaction method, that will returns you the receipt_id and then you can use the service /receipts?id=<your_receipt_id> from the official sawtooth rest api. Then of course you should build a custom abi-decoder to decode the payload
</p>
<p><strong>robinbryce</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 14:06:21 GMT):<br/>
ah, ok. We have been using the go-etherium abigen generated code bindings. And the generated code implements view and pure methods in terms of eth_call
</p>
<p><strong>robinbryce</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 14:12:06 GMT):<br/>
Also I don't understand what this means "when you send a transaction seth-tp rewrite the whole state of the chain" ?
</p>
<p><strong>robinbryce</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 14:14:31 GMT):<br/>
But sure we *could* use the REST-API. We will do that if there is no better alternative
</p>
<p><strong>konsmosc</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 14:16:12 GMT):<br/>
 There is an alternative. That will be that you are going to try to implement the eth_call method by yourselves....
</p>
<p><strong>robinbryce</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 14:20:30 GMT):<br/>
So we are looking at implementing eth_call in seth-rpc. But it would be a shame to start that and discover its just not possible. *IF* we fill in rpc/src/calls/transaction.rs: 'call' in terms of 'sendtransaction' will that work ? Or are you saying if we send the tx, due to how sawtooth works, we will have to wait for consensus on the results of a read only call ?
</p>
<p><strong>konsmosc</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 14:26:27 GMT):<br/>
I don't think that it is possible to implement the method, but i didn't try it. In case you want to try, you have to do reverse engineering to see how eth_sendTransaction is works and then try to implement the eth_call method. 
</p>
<p><strong>robinbryce</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 14:28:23 GMT):<br/>
ok, thats what we are trying. Thanks for your help.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 16:14:30 GMT):<br/>
so the docs for eth_call are "Executes a new message call immediately without creating a transaction on the block chain." - presumably for retrieving data from the smart contract. correct?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 16:16:15 GMT):<br/>
Ethereum is mixing two concepts - transactions to update state and rpc calls to retrieve state. In Sawtooth, transactions are purely for updating state. You would never create a transaction for the sole purpose of retrieving state.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 16:17:10 GMT):<br/>
So, I think what you want to do to implement eth_call is run the EVM within the json-rpc process and not submit a transaction to sawtooth.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 16:19:16 GMT):<br/>
it could go something like this: 1) client talks to json-rpc to make a eth_call; 2) json-rpc talks to sawtooth to get the current state of the related contract; 3) json-rpc locally executes the call using the state obtained and a local instance of an EVM; 4) json-rpc returns the result of the eth_call to the client
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 16:22:02 GMT):<br/>
since the json-rpc is in Rust, might be easier to implement using one of the rust implementations instead of burrow
</p>
<p><strong>robinbryce</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 16:35:15 GMT):<br/>
Ok, thanks very much for such a clear answer. What is the expected model for retrieving data from a pure or view function ? And second, could you elaborate on 2) getting the state - for example, is it possible for *any* go lang process to get the state and execute the burrow EVM ?
</p>
<p><strong>robinbryce</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 16:44:00 GMT):<br/>
Also, data retrieval isn't the only use for a read only call. Otherwise we would probably just wire something up with eth_getStorageAt
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 17:34:13 GMT):<br/>
yeah, the contract state is available to any client of sawtooth. The json rpc would read the bytecode and associated contract state and would execute the read function locally in an EVM. From sawtooth's perspective this would just look like a few state get calls from a client.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 19:49:46 GMT):<br/>
To get state in Sawtooth, you make a ClientStateGetRequest which is defined here - https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/blob/master/protos/client_state.proto. This is done via 0MQ to the validator. The Sawtooth REST API is essentially an adapter converting the REST API interface to the lower-level 0MQ interface. The Seth json-rpc is similar with some additional logic to implement the ethereum interface. For example, you it is used here - https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/blob/master/rpc/src/client.rs#L585

Detail on how the addressing works and how exactly it is stored in state is detailed here - https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/seth/nightly/master/seth_transaction_family_spec.html
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 19:55:32 GMT):<br/>
If you wanted to get this state in Go, you have two options a) talk to the validator via 0MQ; b) talk to the validator via the REST API. For a), you could look at the Sawtooth Go SDK and see how the 0MQ stuff works, but it does not directly support the client proto messages (so there isn't an API to get state). If you want to use the REST API, look at https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/rest_api/endpoint_specs.html#get--state-address
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 19:58:45 GMT):<br/>
re:eth_getStorageAt - yes, I understand your point - there is logic in there that interprets the storage as well. But, as long as you have the contract, contract state, and an evm, you can literally do this anywhere including a client.

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 20:03:09 GMT):<br/>
I think there is a lot of value in implementing eth_call in the Seth json-rpc, as it will make this all less visible moving forward.

<p><strong>robinbryce</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 07:07:29 GMT):<br/>
Excellent, that lays out the landscape very clearly. Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:17:14 GMT):<br/>
We've landed on the model of doing the actual implementation in the transaction processor, since the Burrow machinery and plumbing is already in there, and architecturally it feels like the TX family's only role in life is to emulate (for want of a better word) the way Ethereum works, confused or not.  Then we'll connect up the json-rpc through the currently not working 'eth_call' interface.
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:19:28 GMT):<br/>
I'm hoping to start knocking this up over the next few days so if anyone thinks that's the wrong approach please shout.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 21 May 2019 15:28:31 GMT):<br/>
@JonGeater are you suggesting the rpc calls directly to a TP circumventing sawtooth?
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Tue, 21 May 2019 16:06:01 GMT):<br/>
@amundson **I'm still working on the machinery 
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Tue, 21 May 2019 16:06:01 GMT):<br/>
@amundson I'm still working on the machinery so not clear yet whether it'll 'circumvent' sawtooth as such.  Our use case needs to support 'view' fucntions, not just 'pure' ones, so we have to be able to get state from the ledger: it's not just burrow execution
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Tue, 21 May 2019 16:47:42 GMT):<br/>
Oh wait I see what you mean.  No, it's not a completely new transaction processor, it's an additional handler in the existing seth-tp.  Basically MessageCall() but without the state update bits.

As of about 5 minutes ago it's working so I hope that's OK :-)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 21 May 2019 18:55:56 GMT):<br/>
@JonGeater it's probably the wrong technical approach given the TP's role in the architecture (TPs should only be involved in the state transition function), but if it's better than what it was before, please submit a PR :)
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Tue, 21 May 2019 22:40:18 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @amundson. It’s better in the sense that eth_call functions now and doesn’t appear to screw up any internal state or anything.  So in that sense I’m quite happy with it, but indeed I’m not super proud of the design as it stands.

Mind you, it’s not clear that this is entirely different from error cases where a TP call returns without modifying state...just in this case it’s deliberate ;-). So maybe it’s OK actually.

Let’s see: I’m going to make a branch for our CI and we’ll hit it with our hard use cases.  If it stands up we’ll want to put it in somehow because eth_call support is just too useful.

Now that I've cleaned up and re-submitted my PR for correctly retrieving blocks by number into sawtooth core I've noticed a new oddity as I prepare my PR for Seth.  Sawtooth Core specifies block numbers as an unsigned 64-bit integer, but in Seth a variety of places (notably 'getBlockInfo()') passes block numbers around as int64 - ie signed type.

Does anyone have an insight/opinion on this?  At the moment I've done all of coding to support non-head executions of the VM and eth_call support to fit in and use the signed type but this feels wrong.  Feels like I should go through and fix all those calls to unsigned to match sawtooth core but I want to ask here first and see if that's a super bad idea for historical reasons I'm unfamiliar with.

Example of use (and explicit casting) in current codebase: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/blob/77a9e577f4eb82681e087eaeb3076313ffd9b865/processor/src/seth_tp/handler/handler.go#L220
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Sun, 23 Jun 2019 19:02:04 GMT):<br/>
And the function declaration with the signed type here: https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-seth/blob/77a9e577f4eb82681e087eaeb3076313ffd9b865/processor/src/seth_tp/handler/handler.go#L259

@JonGeater I doubt that is an intentional mis-match, so making it all use unsigned should be fine
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Mon, 24 Jun 2019 14:46:56 GMT):<br/>
Great, I'll put an issue against it in Jira and add it to my PR.  It's all quite self-contained so I'll make it a single PR with 2 commits.

<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Mon, 24 Jun 2019 20:21:24 GMT):<br/>
Oh yuk, this actually goes deep...all the way into block hashes and addr IDs.  It needs fixing but I'll take time to treat it seriously 
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Mon, 24 Jun 2019 20:22:54 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Thu, 27 Jun 2019 21:27:10 GMT):<br/>
It gets weirder, actually...the core Burrow is correct and is consistent in uint64s but the Seth build system actually downloads a fork from knkski which uses signed int64 for block numbers in the Reader interface. Color me confused...any clues why the Seth build relies on this fork?
</p>

There are modifications to Burrow for Seth that were difficult to get into upstream Burrow at the time. It would 100% be a good thing to update Seth to work on the current Burrow EVM.
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Fri, 28 Jun 2019 14:25:43 GMT):<br/>
I quite agree!
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Fri, 28 Jun 2019 14:27:21 GMT):<br/>
I guess that’s my ticket now 😉 
This seems serious enough that it needs a tracker in Jira so I’ll make one (if it’s not there already) and prepare an attack plan for the next contributor call.

I’m stuck in fixing my main issues until this is done so I won’t submit my main PR until the dependency base is fixed

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth-seth?msg=tCZxZLCq8cyq6CtvC) Sure. I have the following use case: Alice has certain data stored on blockchain and private (sawtooth), and Bob wants/has to read this data. He should be able to do it one time if Alice permits. I assume Alice should generate a token and give it to Bob so he can use this token to access that data one time. On second attempt the token should become invalid. Thanks in advance, Jon!

<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Mon, 05 Aug 2019 13:31:18 GMT):<br/>
Ah OK.  Not sure I can help you directly with a 'token adapter module' - not totally sure what that means - but Burrow enables you to run solidity contracts and therefore create ERC721 tokens and wotnot...I can imagine a fairly simple smart contract construct that enables what you want to do

Hi. I'm trying to run fixed supply ethereum token contract on seth. I'm able to deploy the contract and check balance. However, calling transfer function results in error with message "Problem submitting account creation transaction: Invalid transaction." 

I couldn't find any resources online implementing solidity token contract on seth or solution to specific problem I'm facing. Is there anything I'm doing wrong here?
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Sat, 17 Aug 2019 23:44:47 GMT):<br/>
@SPandey You should be able to do this.  I've struggled with completeness of Ethereum support in Seth (I've addressed most of it in a fork but am struggling to get it in shape for a PR) so if you're trying to do really exotic things you may run into problems but it doesn't sound like you're doing anything very taxing.

The debug is not too bad - can you run validator and seth-tp both with -vvv and see what's going on?  Alternatively if you can put the contract and your reproduction steps somewhere (RPC calls, I hope) then I could have a look and see what the underlying issue is.

First question: does your contract/use case work in truffle/ganache/whatever reference Ethereum implementation?

Hey everyone. I'm trying to run the seth-rpc separate from the rest of the docker services. That part appears to be working. What I cannot get to work is deploying a contract. I created an account and registered it. In the logging statements I see the processor sees the request and creates an account. I can list the account using 'seth account list.' When I start the seth-rpc myself, with --unlock, it says it unlocks the same account. However, when I go to deploy a contract, it prints back 'Account with address .... not found.'  Has anyone attempted something similar to this?

<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 10:15:08 GMT):<br/>
Yes I've sen that.  If you split the services into different container then you need to give them some kind of sync'd storage since different bits of the code look for the key files depending on what you're doing.
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 10:19:01 GMT):<br/>
If you look in your TP's service context/storage you'll see a file .../.sawtooth/keys/a35269572f61b8c8711ce39e0e49e5539b6d401a.pem

You need to also arrange for that same path/pem file to exist in the storage that your RPC server can see.

<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 10:20:25 GMT):<br/>
Sorry I never found an elegant way to fix this with soft keys as we're using HSMs/keyvault to store our keys so local re-provisioning to both volumes is easy for us btu wouldn't make a nice PR
</p>
<p><strong>jaredwillard12</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 13:45:55 GMT):<br/>
I did notice this after awhile and added another volume to store the keys in a common directory. I was still getting the same error.
</p>
<p><strong>jaredwillard12</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 13:46:44 GMT):<br/>
I ended up going back to everything in the same container, but still received the "AcountLoadError"
</p>
<p><strong>jaredwillard12</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 13:49:35 GMT):<br/>
I also included the "--unlock <myAlias>" to the seth-rpc container startup command. It logs that it succesfully unlocked the account, but still logs that the address is not found once I try to deploy a contract

Try doing it actually on the RPC rather that the CLI tool
</p>
<p><strong>jaredwillard12</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:28:00 GMT):<br/>
Using it in the CLI didn't cause an issue, it always successfully unlocked the account. 
</p>

<p><strong>jaredwillard12</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:30:24 GMT):<br/>
Okay, weird. I get the error, try to unlock it again, successfully unlocks it. I know try to deploy the contract, works beautifully. Any insight into why this works instead?

<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Fri, 23 Aug 2019 12:32:00 GMT):<br/>
Seth TP is a 'genuine' TP - it works the same as all the others
</p>
<p><strong>AlexanderZhovnuvaty</strong> (Fri, 23 Aug 2019 13:45:06 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth-seth?msg=E67btkdS5uSngC26r) Thanks, Jon! As I understand it is not possible to use Seth TP as gateway between two blockchains even they both support ethereum smart contracts, correct?
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Sat, 24 Aug 2019 16:18:39 GMT):<br/>
@AlexanderZhovnuvaty That is a true thing, but I don't think you could expect Seth TP to axct as a 'gateway' between blockchains.  The purpose of any transaction processor in Sawtooth architecture is to perform chain state interaction between the sawtooth chain (single instance of) and the protocol defined by the transaction family.  So in Seth's case it takes Ethereum-format messages and works out how to translate those to and from Sawtooth.  It's never meant to talk to any other chain or anything. 

This is not special to Seth.  The settings-tp doesn't allow you to trade chain settings with other chains, for example.
</p>
<p><strong>jaredwillard12</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 17:01:18 GMT):<br/>
It appears that the seth-rpc does not handle transactions that come in at around the same time. If I send two transactions at the same time, they get assigned the same Nonce. I'm handling a threading lock on my side to ensure only one request is sent at a time, but I still constantly get repeat Nonces on the rpc side. Is this a known issue?
</p>
<p><strong>jaredwillard12</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 17:21:07 GMT):<br/>
Also, it appears if you attempt to call/transact/create a contract in the constructor of another contract, the seth-tp returns "Invalid transaction: Error while calling VM." However, this functionality is permitted when deploying to the EVM (using geth, for example)
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 22:28:51 GMT):<br/>
Same nonce> If you send 2 transactions that are otherwise identical then that happens, yes.  As long as there is any difference then it won’t.  Does that match your experience?  We worked around this by adding a protocol level nonce (not brilliant, but OK and retains ganache compatibility)
</p>

<p><strong>jaredwillard12</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 12:50:10 GMT):<br/>
No, unfortunately. This is happening when I'm attempting to deploy my contracts
</p>
<p><strong>jaredwillard12</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 13:57:10 GMT):<br/>
Do you happen to know where the check happens to see if they are identical transactions? I might experiment with always incrementing the nonce instead
</p>
<p><strong>jaredwillard12</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 13:57:23 GMT):<br/>
Or including a flag for incrementing it anyways
</p>
<p><strong>jaredwillard12</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 13:58:17 GMT):<br/>
I have libraries with my contracts that might be identical initially, but I want them all to reference their own
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 14:21:18 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth-seth?msg=Zd9jXu5bgYDyQvPgN) It's not a check, as such: there's quite a lot of machinery involved.  The transaction ID is calculated from the hash of the relevant message fields, and that becomes the receipt for the transaction, so if you send 2 messages with identical content you get the same hash, and thus the same receipt, and thus the same answer.  And IIUC if you already have the receipt it doesn't even send the second and subsequent attempts
</p>

Ah, I think that’s a bug.  We found that, and I’m overdue submitting it.  What appears to be happening (in my experience...it’s not quite captured in your screenshot) is that the connection stops responding, so it’s removed from the pool, but then a bit later another piece of cleanup code tries to access it and it’s already gone...and so crashes due to an explicit panic() in the code.  I believe the main maintainers we’re working on this area so it might be better now/soon.  @arsulegai @jsmitchell does this sound familiar?  I looked into this a bit and I think the error is in two parts: it shouldn’t be checking for the entry after removal; and it certainly shouldn’t be calling must_get_entry() (which is why it panics)

<p><strong>SPandey</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 08:55:06 GMT):<br/>
I think I figured out the issue here.

Certain functions in my contract can only be called by contract owner. Owner is set at the creation of contract by assigning "msg.sender" value to "owner_address" varible in the constructor. In ethereum msg.sender returns the account that deployed smart contract and store that address in the variable. But in seth, actual contract address is stored as owner_address. So, calling functions that check if the account is owner account fails to execute.

(msg.sender does return account address while calling the contract functions but that doesn't seem to be the case during contract creation)

Is there a way to get the actual address of account that created the contract and store it as owner_address?

Burrow's EVM expects the global permissions address to exist so panicking on its absence is not in itself a bug. Quoting that issue:

> The unit tests for Seth don't set up the global permissions account, which breaks Burrow

What stops seth from setting up the global permissions account setting up the global permissions account?

I am open to change the design if it could be made more ergonomic, but I don't want to do so just because a test harness does not properly set up EVM state.

@silasdavis the devs that were working on that issue are no longer involved, and so its hard to answer. I think everyone wants to switch to mainline Burrow (we always have), and its just a matter of someone submitting a PR.

Hi there! I was wondering if there is any kind of a diagram describing how Seth and TPs interact. Or any kind of description. I looked at the docs but it’s not very well described.

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 03 Sep 2019 14:12:18 GMT):<br/>
@mpiekarska seth is a transaction processor which marshals the transaction processing to a burrow evm; seth also has a json-rpc compatibility layer which is separate from that transaction processor

Hello guys, I came here to ask about the very same error that got Dan. I'm new to Hyperledger, I set up a fresh new environment in a virtual machine (Ubuntu 18.04, as advised for the latest version of Sawtooth) and I have just tried to run things as shown in the documentation.
I cloned the repository of sawtooth-set and then went in and ran the command `docker-compose up --build` as the getting started guide said.
It successfully built everything until *seth-tp*, then at step 16/16 it gets stuck because:
```
../github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sdk-go/processor/context.go:24:2: cannot find package "protobuf/events_pb2" in any of:
	/usr/lib/go-1.11/src/protobuf/events_pb2 (from $GOROOT)
	/project/sawtooth-seth/processor/src/protobuf/events_pb2 (from $GOPATH)
	/project/sawtooth-seth/burrow/src/protobuf/events_pb2
	/project/sawtooth-seth/common/src/protobuf/events_pb2
../github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sdk-go/processor/processor.go:28:2: cannot find package "protobuf/network_pb2" in any of:
...

``` 
It behaves the same for processor_pb2, state_context_pb2, transaction_pb2, validator_pb2, and then, in the end:
```
ERROR: Service 'seth-tp' failed to build: The command '/bin/sh -c go build -o /project/sawtooth-seth/processor/bin/seth-tp' returned a non-zero code: 1
``` 

I'm stuck here, seriously hope you guys can help me :pray:

I am at this point of the doc https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/seth/nightly/master/permissions.html
however when I try to change permission on the contract address I get:
</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong> (Thu, 16 Jan 2020 10:50:22 GMT):<br/>
`Error: Problem submitting transaction to change permissions: Transaction was submitted, but client timed out before it was committed.`
Everything else is working fine (I can query the blockchain with curl, I can use seth in the container to get info of addresses, I can call function of addresses, etc.
I'm just receiving this error.

PS.: Sorry for the multiple message, I sent it by mistake.

Need some help for the _"Developing Dapp"_ part too :pray: 
When I give `seth-rpc --connect tcp://validator:4004 --bind 0.0.0.0:3030` I receive no feedback from command line, so I go on and try:
`curl -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "eth_blockNumber", "id": 1}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:3030`
`curl http://0.0.0.0:3030 -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "eth_blockNumber"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"`
I reported two commands because first of all I'd like to ask: as far as I understand there is no difference between the two, right?
The behavior is very strange because when I first run it (first or second attempt) it goes through and I receive `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"0x7","id":1}`, however *all*
of the other times I get `curl: (52) Empty reply from server`. It won't go through more than one time, unless I burn down containers and build the test environment again.
What's the problem?
Thanks!

And I have another question: in the receipt of transactions I can see "gas used". Is it calculated the standard way like for ethereum?
Can it be used as an estimate of gas consumption if the same transaction would run on ethereum?
Are addresses free of balance and the network working with no ether at all?
Thank you again!

Hello guys, while waiting for somebody helping on the previous matters I have another question:
I'm receiving a `Invalid transaction: EVM Error: Call error: Authorization exception: Tried to get unauthorized address: [a68b0672b41dc4ba859c1b837291824eea9894ef3f1e8e000000000000000000000000]`.
What may that depend on? I have a contract that works smoothly, however when I try to call this specific function (that calls another one in another contract deployed) I receive this. Why's that?
Same contracts work fine in Ganache and Ropsten.

Hi! I am learning sawtooth seth. I want to install ethereum's ERC20 token smart contract (https://gist.githubusercontent.com/giladHaimov/8e81dbde10c9aeff69a1d683ed6870be/raw/956a73285142650555ed0509e3973fc1601db71a/BasicERC20.sol) into sawtooth seth. I installed it successfully. Now I want to know how to  call constructor function and pass total value? I am following this article to learn https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/seth/releases/latest/contracts.html
As suggested here https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/seth/releases/latest/contracts.html
</p>

<p><strong>drew</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 12:03:37 GMT):<br/>
Hi @selvaraman , I noticed the problem with constructors too, my workaround was the following: I set the constructor as a normal function and I added a flag that prevents the function to be called twice. Such a function is meant to be called with a normal call after deployment. Clearly, if one wants to make sure that no other function can be called before the constructor, a specific "require" on that flag can be inserted at the beginning of each function.
</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 12:06:40 GMT):<br/>
I can answer my own question, for this one, for the benefit of all: you just need to add the flag `-c` during the call through the seth command, to indicate it's a concatenated call.
</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 12:10:12 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @arsulegai, the point is that all the questions I asked are specific for Seth :sweat_smile: 
There is pretty no activity among the community - no stackoverflow questions, no recent tutorials, anything - so this chat is the only place where I hope I'll be able to fine a bit of support - that actually I really need, the aforementioned questions are still open.
</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 14:08:57 GMT):<br/>
I have another question: how can I debug if the only thing I receive when a transaction with Seth doesn't go through is "invalid transaction"?
</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 14:09:16 GMT):<br/>
How can I get more information on the reason why it failed_
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 15:00:47 GMT):<br/>
In Sawtooth, you can send description for an error. This can be captured at the client to learn about the error reason.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 15:00:57 GMT):<br/>
Let me check if seth CLI is capturing such info
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 15:04:27 GMT):<br/>
I see the descriptions are captured in CLI
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 15:05:02 GMT):<br/>
Could you please tell where/which point are you facing difficulty in identifying the invalid transaction reason?
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 15:19:49 GMT):<br/>
@drew most of the discussions are happening in #sawtooth channel. Please feel free to volunteer and help out the community, at least that's how I started. Response could be delayed because of timezone differences, multiple other pending activities, hope  you'll fill the missing gap :)

$CORE_CONTRACT and $AGGR are just there to avoid repeating copy and paste. Other transactions go through, however when one doesn't there's no hint on why.
</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong> (Fri, 31 Jan 2020 11:24:28 GMT):<br/>
In this case I suppose it's for the enconding of the call, how am I suppose to pass an array?
Like, I have a function
`funtion(uint x, uint[] y)`
How am I suppose to pass the parameter in the encoding?
`abi.simpleEncode('function(uint,uint)', '0x0', ?? ).toString('hex')`

In the meanwhile I have another question: how do you encode an enum type? Which type of variable do you use? I've tried uint, uint8 and uint256 but I'm always receiving invalid transaction.
I'm referring to when you need to do:
`abi.simpleEncode('function([TYPE_OF_ENUM])', '0xsomething')`
Which type should I use?
Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong> (Mon, 03 Feb 2020 13:14:13 GMT):<br/>
I changed the type and then I found out I was missing the `-c` option for chained calls between contracts :facepalm:

Thanks but it's not what I'm looking for, if I'm writing here it's clearly because there's no answer in the documentation as far as I could search :sweat_smile: 
The documentation guides you through the process of creating a network with a single node with devmode consensus.
On the other hand, on sawtooth main documentation it is explained how to build a testnet with dockers.
My lack of knowledge (which I'm trying to catch up with your help) is about how to customize dockers so that I can run the testnet example *including* seth.
Hope it's clearer now :)

<p><strong>drew</strong> (Tue, 25 Feb 2020 17:39:19 GMT):<br/>
Guys a theoretical very general question.
I saw, when using seth, that when I call the contract it validates the transaction and the block immediately creating 1 block with 1 batch and 1 tx.
Does this mean that when using seth 1 tx = 1 batch = 1 block ?
If not, how can I aggregate? Does it happen automatically if more tx are received at the same time?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 25 Feb 2020 21:20:47 GMT):<br/>
the number of transactions in a batch are up to the client (so, the cli is putting one transaction in the batch)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 25 Feb 2020 21:21:47 GMT):<br/>
you will generally end up with 1 batch per block if you are using devmode consensus because the rounds are very fast; but if you are using pbft and submit at a fast enough rate, they will automatically get grouped into blocks
</p>
<p><strong>drew</strong> (Wed, 26 Feb 2020 08:42:31 GMT):<br/>
Thank you very much @amundson ! Is there a standard way to test this in Seth or should I write some ad hoc script?

I am suffering the same issue as @selvaraman and @drew. Could someone from the sawtooth team please have a look at this since it is a severe error with the sawtooth RPC client. The error with a full rust backtrace is attached to this message.

<p><strong>vltmn</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 16:38:07 GMT):<br/>
The purpose of the sawtooth project is to run your own blockchain, the purpose of seth is to achieve an ethereum-compatible API on a sawtooth blockchain. Since the rinkeby testnet is an existing ethereum network, the application of this process does not really exist :smiley:

@drew which OS are you running? I have tried using CentOS 7 and MacOS Catalina

<p><strong>vltmn</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 17:15:41 GMT):<br/>
Approx. 15 seconds after the first request, the error I posted is printed and the communication channel to the validator stops working

<p><strong>drew</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 21:02:19 GMT):<br/>
I do agree with @vltmn , and unfortunately that is going to be the general conclusion of my master thesis: Seth is really too underdeveloped and unsupported for it to be considered as a reliable option for basically any use case.
Sawtooth looses a lot of its appeal alongside because it seems to share the same fate.

Hi, guys. For the last 2.5 months my project to build a cryptocurrency has been done using Sawtooth. So far I have good enough results having built a client and a TP in go using the sawtooth-sdk with which I can submit information and store in my blockchain via CLI. It has been a real learning experience so thank you to all of those involved with this framework.

I've now reached the point in my project where I am looking to make it a distributed app, and looking at starting to generate currency, which is where I feel an issue lies... Having built this system using Sawtooth, how much of a difference can I expect if I decide to shift my system to use Seth instead?
</p>
<p><strong>vltmn</strong> (Sun, 29 Mar 2020 19:16:32 GMT):<br/>
If you have an already implemented and working TP for the application you need my opinion is that you should stick to that. Is it possible for you to create a RPC/HTTP API communicating with the validator and supplying the methods you need for the distributed application? As you may see, I and others have had problems with getting seth working without any support from the team regarding the issues we have had
</p>
<p><strong>cg223</strong> (Sun, 29 Mar 2020 19:31:20 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the response, @vltmn. A shame that you're currently having issues configuring your system. 

Whilst I will be asking for help on the sawtooth channel, if there is anyone here in this channel with a working cryptocurrency built using *Sawtooth* that would be willing to share their experience with the rest (anti-patterns to avoid, best practice, etc.),  I would personally be very thankful for your insights.

@cg223 I'd suggest moving to sawtooth sabre; it should be relatively easy to translate what you have already to that environment, and it is also on-chain. 
</p>
<p><strong>cg223</strong> (Fri, 03 Apr 2020 22:09:04 GMT):<br/>
@amundson  thanks for your response. I had a brief look at the concepts behind sabre and whilst interesting, I question whether question there is a Go SDK available?

@cg223 correct. it is pretty straight-forward to translate smart contracts into rust though

Hi everyone, I am using Seth for a project where the goal is to build a tool that can analyse transactions during and after processing. I have finished the frontend and I want to use the a docker seth-rpc container to send transactions dynamically to a network. When using the seth-cli-go container I am able to create a contract and submit requests. However when trying this with the seth-rpc on the same network, the server returns an empty reply. What can be the cause of this? Can it be that I didn't unlock my account properly? It is an encrypted account with openssl -aes128. But when I try unlocking this account, it says "A password is required for encrypted keys!". But no way to enter my password is given. I hope the answer isn't too obvious as I'm very new to this topic. Thanks in advance!

Hi @all i am new to sawtooth - i am working in a hyperledger sawtooth project using sawtooth-seth, followed all documentation steps
create key, account, contract, etc, - all finished good - next tried dapps steps as per the documentation given in this link
https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/seth/releases/latest/dapps.html
after unlocking (not encrypted) key alias as given, tried to call rpc methods, first 2 methods working fine, then suddenly thread panicked error occurs after rpc is blocked and poison error is thrown for remaining methods whatever is called, can anyone please suggest ways to avoid / stop this kind of error, Thanks in Advance

@ombalakumar I have also had the same error. There seems to be something not working in the code. It is most probably not yours or my fault, but errors in the core code. My solution was to switch to a completely custom transaction processor.

Hi, I have a question- if I compose the docker of Seth will it establish an entire validator network by itself? or do I need to do that on my own?
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Mon, 09 Nov 2020 12:50:52 GMT):<br/>
@omerporze please use the #sawtooth-core-dev for the questions. And yes, the docker-compose file there should bring up a single validator node with `seth-tp`

Hi to everybody. I'm trying to follow this documentation -> https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/seth/nightly/master/getting_started.html 
to start learning about sawtooth-seth but after 
"$ docker-compose up --build"
I've got a building error thath from an initial 
"=> ERROR [10/14] RUN npm install ethereumjs-abi web3"
it finished with a
"executor failed running [/bin/sh -c npm install ethereumjs-abi  web3]: exit code: 1
ERROR: Service 'seth-cli-go' failed to build : Build failed"
Can I ask for help here? Thank for you time.

<p><strong>otfreetime</strong> (Fri, 06 Aug 2021 21:02:36 GMT):<br/>
change setup6.x to setup12.x in Dockerfiles in the dirctories (cli-go,cli,rpc) also remove the npm from: your path\sawtooth-seth\cli-go\Dockerfile line 57 chang to (&& apt-get install nodejs -y -q \) after that you can use again $docker-compose down and $ docker-compose up --build i hop this will help.

Is Seth still supported within Sawtooth? We are looking to move Hyperledger Burrow to a Dormant state (at the request of the maintainers), and I would like to understand the impact to Seth.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 03 Jan 2022 21:18:02 GMT):<br/>
Seth's implementation currently uses an old forked version of Burrow, so Burrow's status change would not impact the current version of Seth. Seth itself has not been very active as most of the activity has remained with Sabre. We are planning an upgrade of the Sawtooth website later in the month (primarily to make it easier to change) and we could mark Seth as officially deprecated after that to avoid confusion.
