That would probably be less efficient than using the context manager as the database.  within Sawtooth's context manager, great care is taken to avoid state/database writes when things get thrown out.  for example, if you have a block being processed with many batches and many transactions, if one of the transactions is invalid, no writes to state will have occurred (since the merkle root calculation only occurs when needed)","username":"amundson","ts":"2017-05-11T18:07:20.273Z"}

The contextID is a handle used by the TP to access a \"snapshot\" of state that the TP calculates a state delta on top of. The state delta is recorded by the validator without it actually being written to global state. It is valid until the TP finishes processing the request and responds with OK, signaling to the validator that all changes to state have been requested.\n\nIn other words, the validator sends off a bunch of requests to one or more processors at once, along with a contextID they should use when asking to set/get state. It then manages multiple snapshots of state for each request using the contextID and records all of the requests to change state that the processors send it. Eventually these get \"squashed\" together into one state delta and this is used to actually update global state later (I think when the block is published).","username":"adamludvik","ts":"2017-05-12T16:53:38.424Z"}

{"msg":"A context id is an opaque/random string which is used to lookup the context on the validator side.  There is a 1-to-1 relationship between context and a request to process a transaction.  A context has a merkle root and a key/value dictionary.  When processing reads, the context manager looks up the context based on the context id then retrieves the read based first on the context's key/value store and then the merkle tree.  when processing writes, the context manager updates the context's key/value dictionary (key being the address, value being the data).  Thus, writes to a context do not immediately cause writes to the merkle tree.  Contexts can also be chained together such that the context manager will look through the chain of contexts for a value, which makes what I just described the simplistic case.  When we need to generate a merkle root hash of state, the scheduler will instruct the context manager to squash together multiple contexts.  This causes a write to the merkle tree (which is batched efficiently, updating only nodes that need updating) resulting in a new merkle root hash.  This is usually associated with the end of a block, as block construction requires we generate a new merkle root hash.  Once squashed, contexts are deleted.","username":"amundson","ts":"2017-05-12T18:35:39.675Z"}

{"msg":"Hi. I have a smart contract that has some functions that return some values. I want to call these functions (and don't want to post transaction). On Ethereum mainnet, I can do this using JSON-RPC API \"eth_call\". But I know that support for eth_call is not available in seth. So how can I call contract functions in seth? eth_sendTransaction will post transaction. But I don't want to post transaction, I just want to execute my contract code in EVM and get return value. Is this possible? Thank you so much for the help.","username":"arpit.agrawal23","ts":"2018-12-09T22:44:05.691Z"}

{"msg":"hi, I'm trying to understand why eth_call is not implemented by seth-rpc. The code comment says \"Implementing this requires running the EVM, which is not possible within the RPC.\" Why not just forward it in the same way as for eth_sendTransaction ? Studying the seth-go client appears to show that both state changing and \"view\" or \"pure\" contract functions are handled by simply sending MessageCallTxn to the tp. If thats true, why isnt eth_call implemented similarly to sendTransaction ?","username":"robinbryce","ts":"2019-05-16T12:26:26.051Z"}
{"msg":"First you have to understand why when you send a transaction seth-tp rewrite the whole state of the chain. So the not implemented eth_call is not the only problem. In any case instead of eth_call you can use again the eth_sendTransaction method, that will returns you the receipt_id and then you can use the service /receipts?id=<your_receipt_id> from the official sawtooth rest api. Then of course you should build a custom abi-decoder to decode the payload","username":"konsmosc","ts":"2019-05-16T14:04:19.333Z"}

{"msg":"So we are looking at implementing eth_call in seth-rpc. But it would be a shame to start that and discover its just not possible. *IF* we fill in rpc/src/calls/transaction.rs: 'call' in terms of 'sendtransaction' will that work ?

{"msg":"Hi everyone, I am using Seth for a project where the goal is to build a tool that can analyse transactions during and after processing. I have finished the frontend and I want to use the a docker seth-rpc container to send transactions dynamically to a network. When using the seth-cli-go container I am able to create a contract and submit requests. However when trying this with the seth-rpc on the same network, the server returns an empty reply. What can be the cause of this? Can it be that I didn't unlock my account properly? It is an encrypted account with openssl -aes128. But when I try unlocking this account, it says \"A password is required for encrypted keys!\". But no way to enter my password is given. I hope the answer isn't too obvious as I'm very new to this topic. Thanks in advance!","username":"JonathanvanWestendorp","ts":"2020-04-29T17:33:36.386Z"}
