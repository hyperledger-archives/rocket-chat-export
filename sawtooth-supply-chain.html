<p><strong>zac</strong> (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 18:51:38 GMT):<br/>
@harish.drish In supply chain the private key is encrypted before sending it to the API, and that is just a storage convenience. It allows users to log in and sign with their private key on any device. However the API never sees the unencrypted private key, and if you wanted to do away with that convenience, you could just never send it to the API in any form.

</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Mon, 13 Aug 2018 11:51:36 GMT):<br/>
Yep, there are a number of apps out there you can use for reference. There is a Sawtooth SDK NPM module which will provide you with the transaction/batch protobufs. Then you can POST the bytes to the Sawtooth REST API or your own custom REST API.

Those examples use `webpack` to compile the JS, which allows you to use either Node style modules (`require`, `module.exports`), or ES6 style modules (`import`, `export`).

<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 13:50:25 GMT):<br/>
The Sawtooth SDK itself is written for Node, so some sort of compilation software like `webpack` is necessary to use it in the browser. 
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 13:50:58 GMT):<br/>
(It is on the todo list to make slimmed-down browser only version of the SDK, but that does not exist yet)
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 13:52:38 GMT):<br/>
Webpack is pretty standard these days, so there are a lot of tutorials out there for setting it up with your project. But if you wanted to go without, you could manually recreate what the SDK does without too much trouble.
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 13:52:55 GMT):<br/>
Well
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 13:52:56 GMT):<br/>
Maybe
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 13:54:02 GMT):<br/>
You would need a Secp256k1 library and a Protobuf library. Not sure how many of those work in the browser without webpack  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 13:55:16 GMT):<br/>
These are the two we use:
- secp256k1-node: https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/secp256k1-node
- protobuf.js: https://github.com/dcodeIO/protobuf.js
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 14 Aug 2018 13:57:13 GMT):<br/>
You would need to manually recreate the Protobufs you need (Transaction, TransactionHeader, Batch, BatchHeader, BatchList), which is just a matter of getting the right keys in the right place:
- https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/blob/master/protos/transaction.proto
- https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/blob/master/protos/batch.proto
</p>

Anyway, I recommend `webpack`, much easier, especially if you are new to signing/protobufs

<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Sat, 01 Sep 2018 19:23:41 GMT):<br/>
Hi @zac and all, really basic question:
-----------------------------------

Is the hyperledger blockchain's data public?
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Sat, 01 Sep 2018 19:24:45 GMT):<br/>
specifically the `supply chain` version of it
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Sat, 01 Sep 2018 19:29:05 GMT):<br/>
AKA, if a read operation is applied to the blockchain without authentication, will it return plain text data
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 05:46:34 GMT):<br/>
@LedgerXYZ With any blockchain, all on-chain data is visible to all participants in the blockchain. There are some attempts to work around this limitation, but for now at least this is pretty inherent to the way blockchain verification works.
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 05:48:23 GMT):<br/>
Since Sawtooth is a permissioned blockchain, you can limit visibility somewhat by limiting who participates in the blockchain. Though I wonder about the practicality of relying on this for very sensitive data, as you have to trust every participant not to leak the information.
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 05:53:24 GMT):<br/>
Hyperledger Fabric takes this idea to the extreme with a feature called channels. If you and I had data we wanted to keep private from the rest of the network, we would establish a sub-chain just between the two of us. I have my doubts about this approach. It scales very poorly as every possible combination of participants who want private data must have their own sub-chain. And I don't understand how consensus is supposed to work when only two participants are involved in a blockchain. Seems to me you must have at least three, so that two can outvote a potential third bad actor.
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 05:56:48 GMT):<br/>
There are other approaches as well. Encrypting the data before you put it on-chain (bad). Or storing the data off-chain, but a hash of the data on-chain, so the blockchain becomes a source-of-validity not a source-of-truth (better, but still not great). 
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Sun, 02 Sep 2018 06:02:28 GMT):<br/>
Honestly, I think the best approach for now is not try to come up with some sort of hack to get semi-privacy. Instead, think through your use case, and what data needs to be on-chain and what does not (you should be doing this anyway to keep storage down). Of the data that absolutely must be on-chain, ask yourself if it must also absolutely be private. If you can't come up with a data model that solves your verification, availability, and privacy needs, then a blockchain may not be the right solution for your project.
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Mon, 03 Sep 2018 22:57:45 GMT):<br/>
@zac happy Labor day, and I hope you don't reply to this until after you've finished enjoying the weekend.
When you do get back...

...I am a little surprised that the sawtooth doesn't have a privacy configuration.  The enterprise nature of if I understood to address transaction speeds, however I thought I read earlier that it also addresses privacy concerns that you've correctly pointed out are inherent in a distributed environment like a  blockchain
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Mon, 03 Sep 2018 23:04:10 GMT):<br/>
So given this reality, 2 things.  Can you discuss more about your opinion about:

- Encrypting / decrypting on-chain data through a CRUD permission / grant schemes
- Using external data houses like `IPFS` and then using sawtooth as a permission mechanism to perform CRUD operations

Of course encrypting / decrypting every transaction on the blockchain is expensive.  However, doesn't the distributed nature of the computing effort in a blockchain make the computational cost negligible?   Meaning if `c` = cost to compute, `n` = number of participants, then their relationship is
```
c = 1/ n
````

The entire blockchain ecosystem is built on cryptography it just seems odd that the data is left out
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 05:57:29 GMT):<br/>
Blockchains are different from other peer-to-peer networks because the work is not shared.
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 06:01:42 GMT):<br/>
Every node in the network does _all_ the work.
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 06:02:03 GMT):<br/>
This is a big part of why blockchains face such scaling issues.
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 06:02:21 GMT):<br/>
You get no benefits from scale. In fact it will tend to slow you down.
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 06:04:16 GMT):<br/>
My issue with encryption though is not performance. You can't decrypt it to do any work on-chain anyway. You can only store it. If an on-chain smart contract knows how to decrypt the data and do some work with it, then _everyone_ knows how to decrypt it.
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 06:08:28 GMT):<br/>
My problem with storing encrypted data on-chain is that you are just asking for it to be compromised. Assuming your blockchain is long-lived, that encrypted data is never going away. It will just be sitting out there for years and years. Maybe you accidentally leak the secret, and there is no way to take the data down. Hell, maybe someone manages to brute force it. They will have a long time to try.
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 06:12:59 GMT):<br/>
Storing the sensitive data off-chain and using the blockchain as a source-of-permission and source-of-validity is a much better model I think. A pretty good middle-of-the-road solution.
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 06:13:49 GMT):<br/>
You could ensure the data hasn't been tampered with. You can't use the blockchain to ensure the wrong people don't get access to the data. It will be up to whoever is storing it off-chain to follow the permissions set on-chain. But a lot of folks are looking at blockchains as a decentralized permissioning system. The blockchain also can't ensure that the data is available. Whoever is storing it off-chain could just delete it.
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 06:13:49 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 06:18:04 GMT):<br/>
The short version is this: privacy is counter to the fundamental nature of the blockchain. A lot of people really want privacy in blockchains and are working hard to come up with clever solutions. They may work. They may also not. It may just be impossible. There are some hacky work arounds like channels available today, which might be useful for you, but for the most part data on any blockchain should be considered public.

<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 15:10:47 GMT):<br/>
I like the sawtooth as a permissioner approach because it can be integrated nicely with other chains that are better suited for storing encrypted data
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Tue, 04 Sep 2018 15:14:51 GMT):<br/>
I should also point out that as a consequence of your confirmation that the data on the sawtooth blockchain isn't public, users should be aware that at a minimum, their `public keys` and `names` are not private on the chain
</p>

So examining the sawtooth distributed ledger, reveals all transactions, the actors, timestamps, and values.  Clearly this model as-is will not work in European countries that have enforced the `Right to be forgotten` laws as well as for data sensitive industries like banking, healthcare, etc

@adamgering we haven't generated a long backlog of issues for supply chain recently, though JIRA is the right place for it. however, many of the new features have RFCs - https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-rfcs.

Hello all,  I'm trying to decouple the docker sample to run on a cloud platform in a scalable way and having a hard time figuring out how each component first together. I have a validator, rest-api, settings-tp, rethinkdb, and server up and running (i think), but when I try get the supply-shell up and running it's failing to complete "npm run make-asset". I suspect the issue is that the docker setup is using a shared directory and i've missed something. I'm trying to understand how I can drop the shared directory and correctly build each container with the correct dependencies but having some struggles with that. for example what is the difference between the dockerfile and dockerfile-installed, I'm using the dockerfile in my process.

and so I assume without compiling asset and fish client I can't get those 2 containers running either, since there is no mention of building the content in the asset or fish client dockerfiles, is this being compiled in the supply-shell 
This is what happens when my shell fails it's entrypoint scripts:
npm run make-asset
> supply_chain_server@0.0.0 make-asset /sawtooth-supply-chain/server
> DATA="../../asset_client/sample_data/core_types.json" node ./scripts/seed_core_types.js
http://server.local:3000
RequestError: Error: socket hang up
request arrives at the server though:
Received GET request for /info from ::ffff:10.180.32.146
Received POST request for /transactions?wait from ::ffff:10.180.32.146
seems like the server is answering, but not responding, any help on how I can troubleshoot this?

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth-supply-chain?msg=TJqNz4FwdWiiPhMaY) @Psypher246 What you mean with a scalable way? Sawtooth is on a permissioned blockchain, I would not worry about scaling in the given context. I also had massive issues on the supply-shell. For whatever reason the flag to start code to seed the db etc. was not executed even though it was some time before, so I manually execute it now until I find out why the flag does not work. I don't see any shared directories, all of them are services running in their own container, which area you assume is shared? The initial files from supply-chain are shared but nonetheless they spin up several containers which have no shared "directory". The -installed files are just not rebuilding the whole stack they just re-instantiate a built image, AFAIK.
If you wanna get rid of the supply-shell then you have to move these calls to the fish client container setup with a dependency to the db and other dependencies. You also have to move the scripts that are called to the other containers then.
</p>
<p><strong>Psypher246</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 07:15:46 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth-supply-chain?msg=2fKfs2tKkXkshQuJB) @sassit @sassit By scalable I mean a combination or redundancy for the validator and TPs and scalability for the rest-api and clients. As I understand per organisation I only need 1 tp and 1 validator correct? but the rest of the stuff would need to scale out as users interact with the interfaces.
Regarding the shared directory. In the docker-compose.yaml there is constant mention of mounting the local shared directory into some of the containers, and in the dockerfile it only some of the code is copied to the containers at build time, which means they expect to be able to access the rest of the code from the shared directory. Without it nothing worked as I was wiring this stuff up, for example, the asset client does almost no building in the dockerkfile at all, just writes an httpd.conf file, yet the shell client has to d/l all the node deps and compile the asset and fish client which it stores in the mounted volume, which the asset client accesses as per the docker-compose:volumes:
      - ./asset_client/public/:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/
I think you are correct though to move the build scripts from the shell to the fish and asset client. My shell seems to be seeding the DB correctly but now I'm not sure. 
Can anyone tell me what npm run make-asset is doing (not a node expert), where it's reading it's code from and what it's doing when it connects to the server, which then fails and hangs-up as shown in my post above? If i'm supposed to move these to the containers to build how would it connect to the server to do the build?
</p>
<p><strong>Psypher246</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 15:15:13 GMT):<br/>
I've been able to narrow down the failure point to server/blockchain/index.js line 48:
return stream.send(
    Message.MessageType.CLIENT_BATCH_SUBMIT_REQUEST,
    ClientBatchSubmitRequest.encode({
      batches: [batch]
    }).finish()
  )
but despite help from a colleague who knows node, we weren't able to figure out why or even get any failures to report. any guidance is much appreciated. 
Another thing I'm trying to understand is whether the supply-tp is actually connecting properly to the validator. I see it trying:
INFO | sawtooth_sdk::proces | sending TpRegisterRequest: supply_chain 1.1
INFO | sawtooth_sdk::proces | connecting to endpoint: tcp://validator.local:4004
but I don'y see anything beyond that, no confirmation on either side that it worked. Compared to the setting-tp which has a whole bunch of messages in the log back and forth. Could this be my issue?

@Psypher246 `-installed` is a convention we've been using internally to distinguish between docker components for development and docker components for deployment
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 15:24:49 GMT):<br/>
The default components rely on `volumes` to link to the source code on your host machine. Allowing changes to be reflected without rebuilding.
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 15:25:25 GMT):<br/>
However for deploying you will want to using the `-installed` version of things, as that will actually copy over the source code into the docker images.
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 15:26:34 GMT):<br/>
So, without diving too deep, I think what you want to do is to deploy the installed version of things, and then from `npm run make-asset` from within the `server` component. 
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 15:26:34 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>zac</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 15:27:06 GMT):<br/>
That should do what you need
</p>
<p><strong>Psypher246</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 15:28:09 GMT):<br/>
ok cool, thanks for confirming all those points, definitely helps. I will try -installed and run the scripts again from server.
so they don't have to run from shell?
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 15:30:22 GMT):<br/>
Well, the installed compose file doesn't have a shell. It's basically a big Frankenstein container with all of the source code and dependencies. It's a development tool which you probably shouldn't deploy.
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 15:30:56 GMT):<br/>
However, the server-installed image _does_ copy over the JSON data from the clients, so you can run those scripts directly from within there:
https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-supply-chain/blob/master/server/Dockerfile-installed#L45
</p>
<p><strong>Psypher246</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 16:08:59 GMT):<br/>
@zac, seems the same thing happens, it tries to connect to the server, server shows: Received GET request for /info from ::ffff:127.0.0.1 Received POST request for /transactions?wait from ::ffff:127.0.0.1 in the logs and then nothing happens.
also again when my processor starts up, it still seems like it's not registered with the validator at all
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 16:21:14 GMT):<br/>
ipv6
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 16:29:43 GMT):<br/>
The make asset script follows this routine:
1. Fetch batcher public key from `/info`
2. Builds asset type transactions
3. Submits those transactions to `/transactions?wait`
4. Logs out: `"Types submitted: asset"`
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 16:30:25 GMT):<br/>
That is sequential, so if you are getting HTTP requests to both `/info` and `/transactions` I suspect the weird ipv6 addresses are not the issue
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 16:30:33 GMT):<br/>
Because the first request seems to have worked
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 16:30:56 GMT):<br/>
You might be correct that the server is not talking to the validator though
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 16:32:58 GMT):<br/>
Is the `VALIDATOR_URL` configured properly?
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 16:34:10 GMT):<br/>
You can set it with an environment variable or a `server/config.json` file
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 16:34:46 GMT):<br/>
It defaults to `tcp://localhost:4004` which will almost certainly not work
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 16:34:46 GMT):<br/>
It defaults to `tcp://localhost:4004` which will almost certainly not work for your deployment

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth-supply-chain?msg=sGRkRuqMhGJpdKa92) @Psypher246 I am new to it too but I would say it is correct according to the docs. The code you downloaded and the volumes are connected, so if you develop and build something within the mapped volumes changes are reflected in your container. You won't need that in a released environment so the installed environment will run without building anything as the docker image will be up to date. Normally these files are copied with the COPY command in the docker world, e.g. if you have already built packages you probably will not use volumes. npm run make-asset tells npm to run the command which is in the sawtooth-supply-chain/server/package.json, the command does the seeding of data to the database, the other command does the prototype injections to node. So your command make asset fails sending the protos to the node server.  "make-asset": "DATA=\"../../asset_client/sample_data/core_types.json\" node ./scripts/seed_core_types.js",

How would they connect? If you extract out the server to a different node for your scaling there just needs to be a central service that does the initialisation. In that case only the protos are important, you won't need the seed data.

@zac the server seems to be talking to the validator and yes I do have the `VALIDATOR_URL` set correctly:

But asw I said I suspect the processor isn't working. without running make-asset how do can I validate my processor and validator are working as expected?

@zac I'm still very new at this, was first trying to get the infrastructure up to be like for like but was playing around with the basic blockchain as per the docs: https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/app_developers_guide/ubuntu.html#creating-and-submitting-transactions
but that talks about intkey, where do i find those tools now using the dockerfile-installed process 
or are there other commands I need to use to submit a batch?
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 16:02:02 GMT):<br/>
I thought you were starting up the Docker-installed components in some sort of deployment, and then running `npm run make-asset` from within the server component
</p>
<p><strong>Psypher246</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 16:54:50 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth-supply-chain?msg=P9a766p964oevGDoB) @zac I tried but it still did the same thing, nothing. Do I just run 'npm run make-asset' or the other shell commands in docker-compose.yaml?
cd asset_client/ && npm run build && cd - &&
        cd fish_client/ && npm run build && cd - &&
        if [ ! -f /root/.sawtooth/keys/root.priv ]; then
          sawtooth keygen &&
          cd server/ &&
          npm run init &&
          npm run make-asset &

but then eventually: RequestError: Error: socket hang up on the server
</p>
<p><strong>Psypher246</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 18:44:53 GMT):<br/>
@zac Ive torn down my stack and started from scratch, bringing up each component one by one in the following order: validator > settings-tp > rethink > processor . And when Irbing up settings-tp I see a lot of action in the validator logs, but when I bring up processor, I see no action in the validator logs at all and on the processor logs I just get:
INFO | supply_chain_tp:83 | Console logging level: DEBUG
INFO | sawtooth_sdk::proces | connecting to endpoint: tcp://validator.local:4004
INFO | sawtooth_sdk::proces | sending TpRegisterRequest: supply_chain 1.1

So is that expected? Not to see anything in validator's logs? Seems to me the processor is not connecting. But I can telnet from the processor to validator.local 4004
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 20:36:12 GMT):<br/>
No, the TP should register
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 20:36:25 GMT):<br/>
Which will log on both the processor and validator
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 20:36:44 GMT):<br/>
The validator will say something like "added TP with the family . . ."
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 20:37:04 GMT):<br/>
The processor will say something simpler like "registration successful"
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 20:38:32 GMT):<br/>
If the processor is not registered with the validator, then your batch will just sit in the pending queue indefinitely
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 20:38:48 GMT):<br/>
Which I imagine could cause the problems you are seeing

@Psypher246 ^
</p>
<p><strong>Psypher246</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 07:47:16 GMT):<br/>
@zac so any clues on why it's not registering? FYI I was able to build the standard docker network as described here: https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/app_developers_guide/docker.html# and did not have any issues with the TP. IS there any way to get additional debug logs? I'm already running my validator and processor with -vv 
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 13:46:05 GMT):<br/>
No bullet proof debug methods come to mind. It is interesting that the server is connecting to the validator but the processor is not. Seems almost  certainly to be a networking issue. Is the URL for the validator the same on the processor and server? _Should_ it be the same? Can the processor do any networking at all? The ledger sync should also be connecting to the validator. Is it able to connect?
</p>
<p><strong>Psypher246</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 15:19:28 GMT):<br/>
@zac networking seems fine, yes they are all using the same url. I can also see incoming packets on the validator from the processor when I do tcpdump. It does seem that "sometimes" it connects to the validator:

<p><strong>Psypher246</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 15:22:27 GMT):<br/>
please also confirm what all the steps are for running `npm run make-asset` on the server, is it all the steps I mentioned or just that one?
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 17:24:22 GMT):<br/>
Oh yeah
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 17:24:29 GMT):<br/>
Def not all those steps
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 17:25:12 GMT):<br/>
Though I don't _think_ running all those would cause this issue
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 17:25:32 GMT):<br/>
All you should do is `init` and `make-asset`
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 17:26:11 GMT):<br/>
scratch that
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 17:26:15 GMT):<br/>
just `make-asset`
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 17:26:54 GMT):<br/>
assuming `init` is getting run at start up like in the installed docker-compose file:
https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-supply-chain/blob/master/docker-compose-installed.yaml#L57
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 17:27:26 GMT):<br/>
If `init` has never been run, then you will need to run it. 
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 17:27:42 GMT):<br/>
It sets up the DB tables.
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 17:27:58 GMT):<br/>
Everything else is `shell` stuff though. You wouldn't run it from the server.
</p>
<p><strong>Psypher246</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 19:06:00 GMT):<br/>
@zac I'm starting from scratch again with sawtooth-core. But I noticed that the docker-compose.yaml in the gitbuh repo is again very different from the one in the docs and then there also again a docker-compose-installed.yaml so not sure where to go with this.
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 19:31:54 GMT):<br/>
if you are deploying always use the `-installed` stuff
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 19:32:55 GMT):<br/>
the default docker components are for developing locally, and will only work properly if you are running them from the repo with all of the source code handy

Pop over to sawtooth-next-directory, and ask about Windows dev env setup. Someone can likely get you the steps next week, and they may solve the problem here.

<p><strong>adamgering</strong> (Sat, 20 Oct 2018 08:28:22 GMT):<br/>
I believe the problem is with mounting your OS file system using docker volumes in the docket compose config.

Hi ,I want to know why constant batch key is used in supply chain can we create 2 diff batch key ,is it possible?
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 14:03:50 GMT):<br/>
You mean the signing key?
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 14:04:25 GMT):<br/>
That was a pretty arbitrary non-decision. There are a lot of ways you could structure all of that.
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 14:04:45 GMT):<br/>
It's not configurable though, you would have to go in any change the code yourself.

Well, yes
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 15:05:24 GMT):<br/>
The batcher has a signing key, which is used to generate the batcherPrivateKey
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 15:06:37 GMT):<br/>
I don't know what your use case is to have multiple signing keys on one server, but it is certainly possible. It is not configurable though. You would be making changes to the source code of the server component.
</p>
<p><strong>zac</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 15:06:57 GMT):<br/>
And probably the clients too, since they assume they are just interacting with one batcher.

clients could also batch their own transactions
</p>

It's a configuration variable for the server component: `PRIVATE_KEY`

You can set it with an environment variable or using `server/config.json`

@zac hey how you doing? I finally got over whatever issue I had getting the core sawtooth components working, not really sure what it was but it was networking related, might have been an incorrect FW rule somewhere. Anyway I can reliably bring up a new node now running on sawtooth 1.0.5.
I want to try the supply chain fork again but build it on top of the system I have now. Will the additional services from the version in the supply chain repo work on top of a sawtooth 1.0.5 validator and settings-tp? Do I just have to add the server, ledger-sync, asset-client, fish-client, rethink and supply-tp?
Thanks

Hi @zac and anyone else who can help. I've now also tried running the `docker-compose-installed.yaml` and it too does not want to work. I got it to work up till adding and asset and then nothing happens. IN the logs all I see tis the post attempt:
```supply-server-installed | Received POST request for /transactions?wait from ::ffff:172.23.0.8
supply-asset-client-installed | 172.23.0.1 - - [26/Nov/2018:16:11:19 +0000] "POST /api/transactions?wait HTTP/1.1" 500 205```

<p><strong>Psypher246</strong> (Mon, 26 Nov 2018 15:55:07 GMT):<br/>
What are the fundamental differences between the env spun up by docker-compose.yaml vs docker-compose-installed.yaml. As advised I was to use docker-compose-installed.yaml for a production deployment but it's not working at all, so need some assistance here.
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Sat, 01 Dec 2018 22:12:44 GMT):<br/>
@zac can you please describe (loosely or focused) how the sawtooth supply chain architecture flows into deployment
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Sat, 01 Dec 2018 22:16:25 GMT):<br/>
I especially want to know how `validators` are served by the supply chain tp.  The docs doesn't say, do you officially recommend ubuntu 16.04 or docker containers for deployment.  If yes, what is being deployed and what are similar tools in the wild today that can help one wrap their mind around this concept

@ayanfecrown can you post your `docker file` or `docker compose` file.  Feel free to redact any info you deem private
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Thu, 27 Dec 2018 16:18:00 GMT):<br/>
Also consider I found that sometimes you have to re-login to docker (yes, I know you've logged in before).
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Thu, 27 Dec 2018 16:19:32 GMT):<br/>
command:  `docker login` to login again
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Thu, 27 Dec 2018 16:20:17 GMT):<br/>
Lastly you're better off posting in the the sawtooth channel for faster responses because it seems to be more active
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Fri, 28 Dec 2018 09:13:53 GMT):<br/>
@LedgerXYZ that issue's been resolved. @ayanfecrown ran into it during the Hyperledger hackathon. The resolution is to change 'nightly' to 'latest' in the Dockerfile and also change 'bionic' to 'xenial'. sawtooth-shell had still not been ported to bionic and the nightly build wasn't available.
</p>
<p><strong>LedgerXYZ</strong> (Fri, 28 Dec 2018 16:16:07 GMT):<br/>
@amolk awesome.  I'm happy it worked out.  I'm also happy that you mentioned the bionic issues because I planned to update to that version in January.
</p>
<p><strong>amolk</strong> (Fri, 28 Dec 2018 16:18:05 GMT):<br/>
The nightly for sawtooth-shell will be on bionic.

I am running https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-supply-chain/tree/v0.10.3 in Ubuntu 16.04. I am able to start the docker-compose but keep seeing the error when I open the below APIs ->

*Cannot GET /*

Sawtooth's blockchain REST API will be available at http://localhost:8024
*The webpage at http://localhost:8024/ might be temporarily down or it may have moved permanently to a new web address. ERR_SOCKET_NOT_CONNECTED*

When I run the Asset Client, I am able to create an account, create assets.. but when I transfer the asset to another user -* it doesn't actually transfer the asset. The asset remains with the original owner.  *

This is what I see in my terminal: (repeating error)

I suspect the error is related to ports and/or firewall. Any resolutions for this type of issue? 

(NOTE: i am running the above github code as is. The only change I had to make was increase the timeout time in the yaml files otherwise I was getting timeouts. Shouldn't have impacted the above issue)

I am running https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-supply-chain/tree/v0.10.3 in Ubuntu 16.04. I am able to start the docker-compose but keep seeing the error when I open the below APIs ->

@muniyaraj, you need to edit the Dockerfile inside sawtooth-shell. First, change 'nightly' to 'latest'. If there are still errors, try changing 'bionic' to 'xenial' on the second line.

Hi  ! As reading the backlog, is the sawtooth-supply-chain project has stopped in favor of sawtooth-grid ? 
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 14:31:55 GMT):<br/>
No
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 14:32:45 GMT):<br/>
Grid is based on sawtooth supply chain to start with, but will likely diverge quickly
</p>
<p><strong>paparent</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 14:33:34 GMT):<br/>
" a friendly reminder, the Supply Chain chat channel has moved to #grid *" Sorry I'm confused :) I'm asking because i'm working on a Proof of concept using supply-chain and wanted to know if it's a dead project :)
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 14:34:12 GMT):<br/>
I don’t know why @danintel said that

<p><strong>paparent</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 14:37:17 GMT):<br/>
ok! thanks ! Anyone here uses Windows a dev platform, and isn't able to start the Docker environment?   Starting using master doesn't work because it seems to miss an image from sawtooth-core.. and trying v0.10.3, it kinda start, but the JS bundle from asset-client is doing free games! (some lines appear/disappear when I refresh!)... pretty weird :( 
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 16:50:16 GMT):<br/>
@jsmitchell Sorry I was misinformed. I read about #grid and that #sawtooth-supply-chain will be deleted after a few weeks.

it may continue to serve as a good application example, if we deviate significantly from it w/Grid (which seems very possible)

@mikeborg The current version of sawtooth-supply-chain repo uses Ubuntu 18 (Bionic) and the nightly (bleeding edge) Sawtooth 1.2. I prefer something more stable--Sawtooth 1.1 (latest release, "Bumper"), which is only supported on Ubuntu 16 (Xenial). To patch sawtooth-supply-chain, I do these two steps:
```git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-supply-chain
cd sawtooth-supply-chain
git diff 50c404c >bionic.patch
patch --dry-run -R -p1 <bionic.patch
patch           -R -p1 <bionic.patch

@AmimKnabben  The repo supports Bionic (Ubuntu LTS 18) and Sawtooth Nightly development (Sawtooth 1.2). See my message here on 2019-01-24 on how to reverse the changes so it works with Xenial (Ubuntu LTS 16) and Sawtooth 1.1 ("Bumper" or "latest").

Hi, I've done some benchmarking using custom tool I just did (I looked at Caliper but I don't understand it! :( ) ... I know about back pressure test, so I implemented a backoff retrying.. So : for about 250 create_record, I get between 3-6 item created per seconds.. I tested it locally on docker, and not on a machine on AWS... It seems quite low, isn't it ?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 06 Feb 2019 21:50:51 GMT):<br/>
@paparent we see a higher rate than that, but it is very sensitive to how the testing is done obviously. we use the workload tool within sawtooth-core to submit intkey or xo transactions typically. you could write a supply chain backend for it if you wanted to do it the same way (though, this would better be done within the context of grid perhaps). we are currently working on a high-performance version of our transaction processing capability, so stay tuned, this will look a lot different in a couple months as we shift that part of the core code to a Rust implementation.

Which is best for a farm to fork food supply chain system? Sawtooth, Fabric or just Composer?

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Sun, 24 Feb 2019 00:42:53 GMT):<br/>
@sebastiantf Hyperledger Grid is a new Hyperledger project focused on supply chain. We expect to see a lot of activity there over the next year.

<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Sun, 24 Feb 2019 14:43:26 GMT):<br/>
I believe Composer is an abandoned project, and as far as I know any supply chain work announced on Fabric are based on proprietary closed-source software. The sawtooth-supply-chain repo has a good example of seafood track and trace with automated sensor readings for location, temperature, etc. it might be worth looking into.

<p><strong>varinder</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 04:32:08 GMT):<br/>
Does anyone have experience with using the rest api to submit transactions to supply-chain tp? Is there any documentation/examples on how the payload/transactions/batches should be developed before sent to the validator via the rest call? 
</p>
<p><strong>varinder</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 17:52:56 GMT):<br/>
Basically what I am looking for is an example process to generate a batch that can be submitter via POST/RestAPI to validator. I understand this is the command to do so 

"sawtooth batch submit
The sawtooth batch submit subcommand sends one or more Batches to the Sawtooth REST API to be submitted to the validator. The input is a binary file with a binary-encoded BatchList protobuf, which can contain one or more batches with any number of transactions. The --wait option indicates that results should not be returned until processing is complete, with an optional timeout specified in seconds." (https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/1.0/cli/sawtooth.html#sawtooth-batch-submit)

Hi ! I've around 35 items in the blockchain,, when I hit the API `/api/records?recordType=assetv2` from the Assert client frontend, request take around 6.5secs... I added 3 other object, and now it take 7.5s !.... Shouldn't it be faster, especially it query rethinkdb ?

Hi all,
I've got a challenge with using the Sawtooth Supply Chain Docker Compose files with regards to the differences between `docker-compose.yaml` and `docker-compose-installed.yaml`. 
In the `docker-compose.yaml` file the shell container runs the following commands in order to create the asset records types and seed some samples into the state (this is my rudimentary understanding and from trial and error trying to get things to work)
npm run make-asset &&
npm run make-fish &&
npm run seed-sample-assets &&
npm run seed-sample-fish &&
</p>

But all of these steps are missing from the `docker-compose-installed.yaml` file, so in order to get your app to work, and not just receive an error in the logs about unknown asset type, you need to run a shell and manually run these steps.
Is there a better way to do this that can be fully automated? Ideally without having to run a shell container? Can the asset & fish records types be created with the supply TP instead? What else are these scripts doing that are important?
Thanks!

Hello, I am running hyperledger sawtooth using docker and whenever I run docker-compose up I get the following error from the supply-shell:

Creating Records . . .
supply-shell | StatusCodeError: 413 - {"type":"Buffer","data":[123, ...]}

The data array has length of 50.

I get this error whenever I add a property to the properties array in sample_data.json and there are currently 50 properties defined in the sample data. When I remove the added property, it continues to work.

I am using a different node api outside of the docker environment to fetch the records from rethnkdb.

Thanks in advance

I managed to find out how to do this

Inside core_types.json, we define a struct data type object inside the properties array, and then insert our data type objects inside the structProperties array like so:

{
  “name”: “data”,
  “dataType”: 6,
  “structProperties”: [
    {
       “name”: “exampleProperty”,
       “dataType”: 4,
    }
   ]
}

Then in sample_data.json, we can add sample data by add our data objects into the structValues array like so:

{
  “name”: “data”,
  “dataType”: 6,
  “structValues”: [
    {
       “name”: “exampleProperty”,
       “dataType”: 4,
       “stringValue”: “Some value”
    }
   ]
}

We can also nest a struct data type within another struct. Hope this helps
