{"msg":"Hyperledger Fabric takes this idea to the extreme with a feature called channels. If you and I had data we wanted to keep private from the rest of the network, we would establish a sub-chain just between the two of us. I have my doubts about this approach.

{"msg":"Honestly, I think the best approach for now is not try to come up with some sort of hack to get semi-privacy. Instead, think through your use case, and what data needs to be on-chain and what does not (you should be doing this anyway to keep storage down). Of the data that absolutely must be on-chain, ask yourself if it must also absolutely be private. If you can't come up with a data model that solves your verification, availability, and privacy needs, then a blockchain may not be the right solution for your project.","username":"zac","ts":"2018-09-02T06:02:28.192Z"}

{"msg":"Hello all,  I'm trying to decouple the docker sample to run on a cloud platform in a scalable way and having a hard time figuring out how each component first together. I have a validator, rest-api, settings-tp, rethinkdb, and server up and running (i think), but when I try get the supply-shell up and running it's failing to complete \"npm run make-asset\". I suspect the issue is that the docker setup is using a shared directory and i've missed something. I'm trying to understand how I can drop the shared directory and correctly build each container with the correct dependencies but having some struggles with that. for example what is the difference between the dockerfile and dockerfile-installed, I'm using the dockerfile in my process.\n\nand so I assume without compiling asset and fish client I can't get those 2 containers running either, since there is no mention of building the content in the asset or fish client dockerfiles, is this being compiled in the supply-shell \nThis is what happens when my shell fails it's entrypoint scripts:\nnpm run make-asset\n> supply_chain_server@0.0.0 make-asset /sawtooth-supply-chain/server\n> DATA=\"../../asset_client/sample_data/core_types.json\" node ./scripts/seed_core_types.js\nhttp://server.local:3000\nRequestError: Error: socket hang up\nrequest arrives at the server though:\nReceived GET request for /info from ::ffff:10.180.32.146\nReceived POST request for /transactions?wait from ::ffff:10.180.32.146\nseems like the server is answering, but not responding, any help on how I can troubleshoot this?","username":"Psypher246","ts":"2018-10-10T17:03:42.355Z"}
{"msg":"[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth-supply-chain?msg=TJqNz4FwdWiiPhMaY) @Psypher246 What you mean with a scalable way? Sawtooth is on a permissioned blockchain, I would not worry about scaling in the given context. I also had massive issues on the supply-shell. For whatever reason the flag to start code to seed the db etc. was not executed even though it was some time before, so I manually execute it now until I find out why the flag does not work. I don't see any shared directories, all of them are services running in their own container, which area you assume is shared? The initial files from supply-chain are shared but nonetheless they spin up several containers which have no shared \"directory\". The -installed files are just not rebuilding the whole stack they just re-instantiate a built image, AFAIK.\nIf you wanna get rid of the supply-shell then you have to move these calls to the fish client container setup with a dependency to the db and other dependencies.

{"msg":"[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth-supply-chain?msg=2fKfs2tKkXkshQuJB) @sassit @sassit By scalable I mean a combination or redundancy for the validator and TPs and scalability for the rest-api and clients. As I understand per organisation I only need 1 tp and 1 validator correct? but the rest of the stuff would need to scale out as users interact with the interfaces.\nRegarding the shared directory. In the docker-compose.yaml there is constant mention of mounting the local shared directory into some of the containers, and in the dockerfile it only some of the code is copied to the containers at build time, which means they expect to be able to access the rest of the code from the shared directory. Without it nothing worked as I was wiring this stuff up, for example, the asset client does almost no building in the dockerkfile at all, just writes an httpd.conf file, yet the shell client has to d/l all the node deps and compile the asset and fish client which it stores in the mounted volume, which the asset client accesses as per the docker-compose:volumes:\n      - ./asset_client/public/:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/\nI think you are correct though to move the build scripts from the shell to the fish and asset client. My shell seems to be seeding the DB correctly but now I'm not sure. \nCan anyone tell me what npm run make-asset is doing (not a node expert), where it's reading it's code from and what it's doing when it connects to the server, which then fails and hangs-up as shown in my post above?

{"msg":"I managed to find out how to do this\n\nInside core_types.json, we define a struct data type object inside the properties array, and then insert our data type objects inside the structProperties array like so:\n\n{\n  “name”: “data”,\n  “dataType”: 6,\n  “structProperties”: [\n    {\n       “name”: “exampleProperty”,\n       “dataType”: 4,\n    }\n   ]\n}\n\nThen in sample_data.json, we can add sample data by add our data objects into the structValues array like so:\n\n{\n  “name”: “data”,\n  “dataType”: 6,\n  “structValues”: [\n    {\n       “name”: “exampleProperty”,\n       “dataType”: 4,\n       “stringValue”: “Some value”\n    }\n   ]\n}\n\nWe can also nest a struct data type within another struct.
