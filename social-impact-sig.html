@alissa.worley to get started on the matrix, do you happen to have a blank template that we should all use or should we just create one?

Hi Caine! Welcome, welcome :-) I think you can create your own - a basic one would have four quadrants (upper right = big impact, easy to execute, lower left minimal impact, hard to execute) But depending on the use case, their may be more layers depending on stakeholders, for example.

<p><strong>CaineSmith</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 21:16:27 GMT):<br/>
@rjones can you clarify the if we should be using this rocket chat or email for group communicatuions? 

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 21:27:34 GMT):<br/>
@CaineSmith I think the email list is better, but I don't make that decision from my seat. @tkuhrt may have other guidance

We tend to let the group decide what works best for them. If the communication you are doing is something that you want to be more easily searchable or something where you think threading is useful, then the mailing lists make more sense.

Hi @CaineSmith the call didn't happen and @RicShreves and @alissa.worley are working on getting the regular call set up. You can use both chat and mailing lists, mailing might be the better way to go for now as people get used to using the chat

I believe at this point it's just the ongoing email thread (subject "Welcome, Hyperledger Social Impact Working Group!") that has the obsolete links. @KOttoni : when you have a moment, would you mind a reply-all on that thread to update the links for this channel for those that have not joined yet?

Hi all, so nice to know this group that aims to create social impacts toward to the world with technology. I'm Chris from Hong Kong, a digital marketing guy fond of blockchain technology. Love to know more about you guys and your projects in weekly calls.
I also focus on writing my own blog "BlockImpact" to delineate what's happening in the space. :)

@Chris_BlockImpact Projects are definitely interesting as well, but a debate amongst the group about what's wrong with charitable donations and how blockchain could apply would be interesting....feel free to add it to a future meeting agenda or mailing list topic!
</p>
<p><strong>Pradeep_Pentakota</strong> (Sun, 10 Feb 2019 02:08:17 GMT):<br/>
The problem with charitable donations is lack of transparency in the whole process. 
Organization like WHO or Redcross have to depend on local NGO entities in respective countries where WHO doesn't have any footprint. Trusting the LOCAL NGO will give the donated assets is one problem which I see.
</p>

I just came across this opportunity to share your use case to be potentially included in an upcoming report by the U.N. International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Please see the message below and links for details on submissions. The deadline is March 29th.

Also keep an eye out for an upcoming meeting invite soon!

========
I am a member of ITU Focus Group on Application of Distributed Ledger Technology (FG DLT). ITU is the United Nations’ specialized agency for information and communication technology.

Over the last year, the Focus Group has been collecting DLT use to compose its technical deliverables. You can see a past call for input at https://news.itu.int/inviting-blockchain-use-cases/.

Moving ahead, we are focusing on collecting use cases, which have at least a proof of concept, and are not yet covered in our use case collection.

I would like to invite you to submit your initiative’s use case for consideration by the group. If you are interested, please submit your input using the template available at https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/focusgroups/dlt/Documents/FG_DLT-Use_case_template.docx. The deadline for document submission for this meeting is 29 March 2019, but the sooner the submission, the bigger the probability of feedbacks from experts. 

More information about the focus group is available at https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/focusgroups/dlt/Pages/default.aspx.

Dear Social Impact SIG community,

We are back from a mini-hiatus and you may have seen that we have a new meeting time established, bi-weekly on Tuesdays at 10am EST starting with the next meeting on April 2nd. I include the dial in details below. Here is how you can get the calendar invite added to your personal calendar:
1. Visit the Hyperledger Calendar of Public Meetings
2. Find the next Social Impact SIG meeting on April 2nd, click on it and you'll see a link "copy to my calendar", click on that link and it will open a separate window or download the invite. If you have any questions, let me know.

Call for Agenda Items
Our group is an open forum for anyone to participate in and contribute to, is there anything you'd like to share or discuss or propose the group work on? Please let me know and I'll get it added to the agenda for next week and share that around on prior to the call.

We've had quite a few new subscribers to our mailing list in the past few weeks, so we hope you will introduce yourselves in the call or here online and share with us your interest and what you're working on.

I look forward to connecting with you all again soon and seeing what updates you have for us.

The Sovrin Foundation is pleased to share with you our new white paper examining identification management systems in the humanitarian sector that use distributed ledger technology (DLT). 

Humanitarian assistance is increasingly managed and delivered remotely via digitized administrative and operational systems that center on “beneficiary management” software to manage the identification of individuals being served. Specifically, this report analyzes systems that use DLT to perform these functions, offering insight into their potential benefits and risks. It assesses arguments for and against the use of DLT-based systems and digs into the implications, for individuals and institutions, of shifting to a distributed paradigm. https://sovrin.org/dlt-based-identification-in-the-humanitarian-sector/

Hey everyone ! My name is Kaustubh, and I’m a co-founder of a fintech startup in India called Pyse. We provide an avenue for fractional ownership of alternative investment products, and every asset contributes to either environmental or social impact. I would love to share my idea with this group, and also contribute in anyway possible.

Hi everyone,

My name is Adrian founder of GST. We are a global tech community in 35+ countries and we have partnered with the Hyperledger community in the past to make connections worldwide.

I just had a chat with David Boswell, and he mentioned you guys are doing webinars for the community and present projects and/or startups relating to Social impact blockchain solutions.

Now, I’m reaching out because we are interested in helping those projects connect with the right partners in multiple new markets for the purpose of scaling up, finding sales, and distribution channels.

We do this through a matching engine by matching real-world organizational problems with solutions. We would love and get more data on those projects here. Check out this post https://medium.com/globalsouthtech/looking-for-teams-startups-and-projects-to-help-them-scale-up-bce9497eadfa

I would love to engage further with this group and explore collaborations if any comments please just let me know

Thanks a lot
Adrian

Hi everyone, we are running a research for evoting with blockchain technology through a European project and would like your participation if possible and to disseminate the questionnaire to your members list if possible. It is small and easy to follow. I am posting it here if you are interested to participate. Thank you. https://research.token.iti.gr/index.php/956152

@nanmin Sorry to drop off the call today! I realized I had to join my next call. Great discussion everyone and I look forward to seeing what you do at HGF. I think there is a gap in this space with a real conversation about the advantages of open source and I think this group could try to champion that topic as I don't hear it coming from anywhere else.
</p>
<p><strong>nanmin</strong> (Tue, 16 Mar 2021 15:17:24 GMT):<br/>
Thank you Karen for your insights into some of the pressing issues. We're looking forward to an engaging submission to HGF.
