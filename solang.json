{"msg":"Hi @sbalikondwar \nI've merged the changed for `import` statements. This changes the interface to solang somewhat, since now multiple files might be needed to compile a solidity file. These files do not have the reside on disk, so the `parse_and_resolve` function now takes a  `FileCache`. You can add files to the cache or set an import path, in which case files can be loaded from disk.\nThe solang tests use solang as a crate, just like we were planning for the language server. This is an example: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang/blob/master/tests/substrate_imports/mod.rs#L9\nNot sure about the name `FileCache`.

{"msg":"Actually, you might be stuck on the expression emitter. There is something I had not thought of. After codegen, expressions may only read variables, not write variables. Only instructions can write to variables.\nSo for push/pop expressions, there are two way of doing this:\n1. Make push/pop return the new value of the array, and wrap the push/pop in a Set instruction, like is done here for simple variable assignment: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang/blob/master/src/codegen/expression.rs#L858\n2.

Expression is the value to be pushed or zero/default value if push was called with no arg. Then in codegen return an expression to the variable res (this should be a temporary variable).\nIn emit, this instruction will call `__realloc` while reading/writing array variable. new value needs to be written and res needs to be set.","username":"seanyoung","ts":"2020-07-20T08:28:10.313Z"}

{"msg":"So there a few issues which case the assert to fail in the test.\n1. The length of the array is dynamic, so this has to be loaded from the vector. This is how you load the array length: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang/blob/master/src/emit/mod.rs#L1688\n2. The new length needs to be written to the array, use build_gep() like you used for loading the length with build_store().

One of the contracts will have a loc field `pt::Loc(1, ... )` and the other `pt::Loc(0, ...)`. The 1 or 0 indicates an offset in the `files` field.

{"msg":"@sbalikondwar right, that will break the server. The problem is that in Solidity, you can declare a function type like `func` in this example:\n```\n\n        contract Arith {\n            function test(bool action, int32 a, int32 b) public returns (int32) {\n                function(int32,int32) internal returns (int32) func;\n\n                if (action) {\n                    func = mul;\n                } else {\n                    func = add;\n                }\n\n                return func(a, b);\n            }\n\n            function mul(int32 a, int32 b) internal virtual returns (int32) {\n                return a * b;\n            }\n\n            function add(int32 a, int32 b) internal virtual returns (int32) {\n                return a + b;\n            }\n        }\n```\nSo, when `func(...)` is called, func is a reference to a function. The `Expression::InternalFunctionCall` changed so that the function being called can be an expression.\n\nI'm afraid I can't change the code back, this is a feature which is needed for Solang.\n\nYou can change your code to:\n\n```\nInternalFunctionCall {\nloc,\nfunction, ..\n}  => {\nif let Expression::InternalFunction { contract_no, function_no, .. } = function.as_ref() {\n   ...\n}\n}\n```","username":"seanyoung","ts":"2020-10-31T08:20:20.904Z"}

{"msg":"What is the best way to fix this?","username":"lucasste","ts":"2021-08-17T18:43:53.008Z"}
{"msg":"I could think of two possibilities:\n1. Add `try_catch_error: Option<usize>` to `Instr::BranchCond`. This way I can link block 0 to block 4 during reaching definitions.\n2. Create a `Instr::TryCatch`, with `cond: Expression`, `success_block: usize`, `error_block_1: usize`, `error_block_2: Option<usize>`. This makes more sense to me, but `error_block_2` serves only to signal reaching definitions of another block. The actual work is done by `AbiDecode`.","username":"lucasste","ts":"2021-08-17T19:32:12.990Z"}

{"msg":"This branch is followed if abi decoding fails. This also means that the branch will happen from the not-last-instruction of the block.

{"msg":"This hack exists because of the code gen. The generated abi decoder can encounter problems in various cases (not enough input, input value does not make sense, trailing input). All these cases need a branch out of the code.","username":"seanyoung","ts":"2021-08-18T08:02:30.243Z"}
{"msg":"When the exception branch is followed, none of the of the decoded values are valid, they should all be undefined. I'm not sure how this can be represented in the CFG.\n\nIn actual fact I think the right solution is to re-write the abi decoder in CFG instructions, rather than building it using llvm.

{"msg":"@seanyoung Good day! Return statements with function calls and ternary operators returning tuples do not work[0]. Tentatively I tried to fix it myself[1], however I do want to ask what would be the best way to proceed (as codegen and possibly some other things need to be fixed as well), as of right now `Statement` for `Return` contains inside it a `Vec` of expressions[2], however it might be better to replace it with a simple expression as done in `Destructure`, also the code for return statements is structurally the same as for pattern matching tuples and I wonder whether it can be somehow reused.
