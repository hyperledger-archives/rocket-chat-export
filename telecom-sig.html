#SLA Hello all. I added some items to the #SLA reading list. 
</p>
<p><strong>viprat</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 15:56:20 GMT):<br/>
Hi Nima Thanks for sharing the list. 
</p>
<p><strong>viprat</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 15:57:47 GMT):<br/>
@pete we can start our discussion on SLA here. For applying in ONS we have to start working on white paper.
</p>
<p><strong>viprat</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 15:58:32 GMT):<br/>
@nimaafraz We got bna file from IBM. Here is the link https://github.com/amanrubalibm/hyperledger-labs_SLA/blob/master/proposal-template.md

That's great. I will try to start working on it.
</p>

Cool
</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 22:01:41 GMT):<br/>
Nice one team. I will try to load that into my Hyperledger environment - pending a cloud hosted solution.

Hey All,

<p><strong>nimaafraz</strong> (Sat, 18 May 2019 16:00:37 GMT):<br/>
Hey All, I just deployed the SLA bna file into a fabric network on my cloud vm so you can try and see how it looks like. Here is the link: http://34.74.133.32:4200/
I think there are two things that we can do to make the code a bit more usable:
1- Right a README file for the code.
2- Defining a SetupDemo transaction which would setup a number of service providers, vendors, and tickets and populate the network so we can actually try some of the contracts and take screenshots etc. for the whitepaper.

<p><strong>nimaafraz</strong> (Sun, 19 May 2019 14:37:43 GMT):<br/>
Hey all,
I also drafted a new Readme file on my own fork of the repo. Please let me know what you think. https://github.com/nimaafraz/hyperledger-labs_SLA/blob/master/README.md

</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong> (Sun, 19 May 2019 20:41:49 GMT):<br/>
Hi @nimaafraz that looks really good. Which cloud environment are you using? I have a local instance of Fabric which I would like to host online as well. Any pointers on how to deploy Fabric to the cloud?
</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong> (Sun, 19 May 2019 20:42:49 GMT):<br/>
@nimaafraz Edit: I see that is explained in the Readme. Nice!
</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong> (Sun, 19 May 2019 20:43:47 GMT):<br/>
@nimaafraz Is it possible to generate a React app for it instead of Angular? 
</p>
<p><strong>nimaafraz</strong> (Mon, 20 May 2019 07:57:49 GMT):<br/>
Hey @pete, I'm using a minimal google cloud VM instance with only one vCPU. Very efficient and easy to use cloud environment.
About the React App I'm not the best person to ask but essentially the composer provides REST API access so it should not be a problem to set up any frontend. This POC is using a React app: https://github.com/hyperledger/composer-sample-applications/tree/master/packages/letters-of-credit
</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong> (Mon, 20 May 2019 07:58:12 GMT):<br/>
Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>nimaafraz</strong> (Mon, 20 May 2019 08:00:13 GMT):<br/>
You are welcome, also the SetupDemo transaction is done and added to the repo. You can also use the SetupDemo transaction which would populate the network with 2xCustomers, 2xServiceProviders, 2xServiceVendors.


</p>
<p><strong>nimaafraz</strong> (Mon, 20 May 2019 15:57:30 GMT):<br/>
Hello again, I had to make some changes to my cloud server and now the updated SLA POC is available here: http://34.74.133.121:4200/
</p>
<p><strong>viprat</strong> (Mon, 20 May 2019 16:54:29 GMT):<br/>
Hi, Nima thanks for the update.  I am getting 401 authentication error when trying to access anything
</p>
<p><strong>nimaafraz</strong> (Mon, 20 May 2019 18:05:18 GMT):<br/>
Hey @viprat, You can use the playground implementation meanwhile I look into the problem: http://34.74.133.121:8080/
</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong> (Mon, 20 May 2019 19:47:53 GMT):<br/>
hi @nimaafraz could you please explain how to trigger the SetupDemo transaction from the playground?
</p>
<p><strong>nimaafraz</strong> (Mon, 20 May 2019 19:48:24 GMT):<br/>
Hey All, I got it working again. However, this is only for the purpose of familiarity and helping us with the whitepaper. http://34.74.133.121:4200
</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong> (Mon, 20 May 2019 19:49:04 GMT):<br/>
I can confirm access to http://34.74.133.121:4200  will this stay online over the next few weeks? Very useful
</p>
<p><strong>nimaafraz</strong> (Mon, 20 May 2019 19:52:53 GMT):<br/>
@pete I can try my best to keep it up and running (by not playing around with it). 
For the SetupDemo transaction, the best way is to deploy the latest .bna file in my GitHub branch(https://github.com/nimaafraz/hyperledger-labs_SLA) into the online playground (https://composer-playground.mybluemix.net). Then you can just go to the test tab and submit transactions and choose the SetupDemo from the dropdown menu.
</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong> (Mon, 20 May 2019 19:53:17 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @nimaafraz !
</p>
<p><strong>nimaafraz</strong> (Mon, 20 May 2019 19:53:35 GMT):<br/>
@pete You are welcome. 
</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong> (Mon, 20 May 2019 20:58:36 GMT):<br/>
Hi @nimaafraz  I have a suggestion in terms of definitions. Can we treat a 'ServiceVendor' like a company that sells a product (for example T-Mobile) to an end-customer? Can we treat a 'ServiceProvider' as a company that provides physical or technical infrastructure (like Huawei)? With this setup it seems logical that the ServiceVendor creates a TroubleTicket upon request from the end-customer for example because of a network connectivity issue that (s)he is experiencing. The ServiceProvider will then work on this ticket. Do you agree with these assumptions?
</p>
<p><strong>nimaafraz</strong> (Tue, 21 May 2019 07:51:01 GMT):<br/>
As far as I understood from the tmforum slides, the model is the same as you described. We can bring this up in the next meeting.
</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong> (Tue, 21 May 2019 21:00:30 GMT):<br/>
Hi @nimaafraz great idea thanks

Hi everyone! My name is MªTeresa and I work in Telefonica. Yesterday, we published a post in Hyperledger’s blog about an IoT PoC that we have made with aitos.io using the project TrustID (https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/TrustID) in order to decentralize identity in Hyperledger Fabric. Hope you find it interesting 😊 Any feedback is welcome!  https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2021/02/17/full-decentralization-of-hyperledger-fabric-through-embedded-iot-solutions
