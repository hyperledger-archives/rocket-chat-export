{"msg":"Hi @nimaafraz  I have a suggestion in terms of definitions. Can we treat a 'ServiceVendor' like a company that sells a product (for example T-Mobile) to an end-customer? Can we treat a 'ServiceProvider' as a company that provides physical or technical infrastructure (like Huawei)? With this setup it seems logical that the ServiceVendor creates a TroubleTicket upon request from the end-customer for example because of a network connectivity issue that (s)he is experiencing. The ServiceProvider will then work on this ticket. Do you agree with these assumptions?","username":"pete","ts":"2019-05-20T20:58:36.545Z"}
