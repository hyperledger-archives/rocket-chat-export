Is this more of a general purpose chat or is it focused more specifically on either dev-ops or business applications?

We are looking for Fabric Developers and training groups to help us design the next Fabric Developer Certification on July 8-11 at the LF offices in SF.  If you have Fabric experience please apply here. ttps://forms.gle/v4CuDnHQ9QA9pf6p8
</p>
<p><strong>cryptog</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 14:26:13 GMT):<br/>
I'm more interested in fabric development from a financial services point of view, but their doesn't seem to be a channel for that here...
</p>
<p><strong>cryptog</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 14:28:40 GMT):<br/>
Though I am interested in the dev cert program you referenced above. I'm just an analyst/architect. I am finding myself having to do more dev work for various teams at my firm due to the lack of knowledge with fabric.
