Some ideas I've received:
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 19:56:13 GMT):<br/>
Hyperledger Delta - Transforms the state from the smart contracts above to framework below
Hyperledger Transmission - Transmits the power from the smart contract “engine” to the ledger
Hyperledger Torque - Bit catchier on the car/engine theme
Hyperledger Shift - Transition from one state to another
Hyperledger Turing - Because
Hyperledger Edge - Represent transitions from one state to another as caused by the input (feels a bit IoT/edge computing to me though)
</p>
<p><strong>danoprey</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 19:56:19 GMT):<br/>

i like Transact
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 20:55:23 GMT):<br/>
Transact is an implementation of an abstraction, so maybe *Hyperledger Dali* or *Hyperledger Rothko*?
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 20:58:11 GMT):<br/>
it's also kind of a "one thing to rule them all" - so maybe *Hyperledger Asha* which is a deep cut reference to the largely agreed upon name of the 'ring' in LOTR: _Ash Nazg_
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 21:08:25 GMT):<br/>
lastly, a plug for *Hyperledger Cornholio*, someone who always needed TP (transaction processing)

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:02:22 GMT):<br/>
unfortunately, we will be dropping the TP name. mostly because of the cornholio joke.

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:03:07 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>danoprey</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:04:11 GMT):<br/>
We will need an icon at some point, under this format. but the LF creative team can assist with that
</p>
<p><strong>danoprey</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:05:02 GMT):<br/>
"Hyperledger Transact" is far too generic, unfortunately. I'm not sure there's a blockchain project that couldn't qualify for that name
</p>
<p><strong>danoprey</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:05:19 GMT):<br/>
Mill isn't bad
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:06:05 GMT):<br/>
too generic? do you mean too literal?
</p>
<p><strong>danoprey</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:06:32 GMT):<br/>
too literal and too widely applicable
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:09:57 GMT):<br/>
much less than "composer" or "explorer" though, if we are using current names as a guide
</p>
<p><strong>danoprey</strong> (Tue, 07 May 2019 22:12:43 GMT):<br/>
those were mistakes... to be frank

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 17:43:10 GMT):<br/>
my thoughts on a few of the suggestions:
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 17:43:12 GMT):<br/>

Hyperledger Delta - Great from the perspective of state transition functions producing receipts. However, existing database project exists - https://github.com/delta-io/delta.
Hyperledger Transmission - Meh
Hyperledger Torque - Not bad, but there is an existing open source project related to queueing - https://github.com/adaptivecomputing/torque
Hyperledger Shift - Too close to OpenShift
Hyperledger Turing - There is a programming language called 'Turing'.
Hyperledger Edge - Nice, but network layer connotations and 'Microsoft Edge'

</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 17:50:29 GMT):<br/>
Hyperledger Cornholio - too corny
Hyperledger käntrakt - non-ASCII characters
Hyperledger Bind - Too close to the DNS server project - https://www.isc.org/downloads/bind/
Hyperledger Dynamo - Another project - https://dynamobim.org/
Hyperledger Morpheus - Associations with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morpheus_(software)

</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 17:55:00 GMT):<br/>
Hyperledger Dali - Another open source project - https://developer.nvidia.com/DALI
Hyperledger Rothko - small open source effort using the name - https://github.com/Haacked/Rothko
Hyperledger Turbine - existing (defunct?) crate - https://crates.io/crates/turbine

</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 17:55:31 GMT):<br/>
these didn't have any substantial disqualifications I could find:
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 17:55:40 GMT):<br/>
Hyperledger Transact
Hyperledger Mill
Hyperledger Asha
Hypereldger Evolve

</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 18:07:34 GMT):<br/>
Hyperledger Transact sounds good
Or inspired by @cbf idea, "Hyperledger Tract" is another name I can think of
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 18:08:54 GMT):<br/>
:neutral_face: there's already a open source project by that name https://github.com/snipsco/tract
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 18:25:44 GMT):<br/>

@danoprey "Hyperledger Transact" seems universally popular compared to the other names. How strong is HL marketing's position against it? Could we proceed with it?
</p>
<p><strong>danoprey</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 16:15:29 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>danoprey</strong> (Mon, 13 May 2019 16:18:15 GMT):<br/>
personally, I still feel this is a less than ideal name from a marketing perspective as it is not unique, gives little sense of what the project does, will be hard to defend if we ever wanted to register as an individual trademark, and will do poorly on SEO. I'd really encourage the team to come up with something they love which has a better back story too it and has more charm. Aries, Burrow, Sawtooth, Ursa are good examples of these.

However, it is pretty unanimous to go for transact with a pretty big dropoff. So if that's what the community want to go for then no objection to proceeding with Hyperledger Transact
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 01:29:50 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 20:06:21 GMT):<br/>
Ok, I think we have a couple choices - 1) move forward with 'Hyperledger Transact'; or 2) take another week and try and come up with more options. @mastersingh24 @Dan @cecchi @agunde @jsmitchell @pschwarz - As project sponsors, we should all agree on how to proceed.  While I acknowledge some of the points made against it, I think 'Hyperledger Transact' will be a solid name for a library project. I suggest we move forward with 'Hyperledger Transact'. Please vote.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 14 May 2019 20:06:26 GMT):<br/>
1) move forward

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 21 May 2019 14:42:44 GMT):<br/>
So, I propose we setup three git repos: "transact", "transact-rfcs", and "transact-contrib". The "transact" repo will contain the library. The "transact-rfcs" repo will contain RFCs (similar to sawtooth, grid, ursa, etc.). The "transact-contrib" repo will contain examples or early-stage work/integrations that aren't yet officially supported.

docs will go in "transact" ?

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 21 May 2019 15:13:37 GMT):<br/>
currently, I'm poposing the only docs we have are rust api docs. no sphinx-doc, no website.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 21 May 2019 15:14:39 GMT):<br/>
(so yes, in the .rs files in "transact" repo)

<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 12:10:36 GMT):<br/>
I've a question on Transact, state is made part of it and Blockchain implementation would use the state implementation provided by it. Does it mean in future, there's plan for making Transact pluggable interface for underlying Blockchain frameworks?

I am unable to realise if there's other specific reason behind it.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 12:14:08 GMT):<br/>
The idea is that Fabric, Sawtooth, etc would use transact as a library. The choice of persistence is up to each blockchain, and transact is going to provide interfaces compatible with those choices. 
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Wed, 12 Jun 2019 14:21:01 GMT):<br/>
There is a trait for State, where it operates on some state id (for example, in Sawtooth, this would be the merkle state root hash), and key/value pairs.  Transact provides an implementation using a Merkle trie, backed by LMDB or an in-memory btree database.  This may be optional, based on a Rust feature, but we're still considering what things are there by default and what are optional.

Thanks that clarifies

i think the prism is problematic for a bunch of reasons
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 17:06:42 GMT):<br/>
i like both of the others, but I like the 'beaker'/delta thing a bit more

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 17:06:57 GMT):<br/>
+1 on the beaker
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 17:07:12 GMT):<br/>

think of a sticker with only the glyph on it - needs to be distinct enough for a sticker, easy to put on a hat, etc. We have some logos right now that are not easy to use.

As we start working on Go bindings for transact and Go transaction/batch building code, we will need a place to put it. I propose we place it in a new repository called "transact-sdk-go".
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 02 Aug 2019 16:02:08 GMT):<br/>
And that, moving forward, would translate into a general transact-sdk-[lang] pattern for any new langauge binding and/or transaction/batch building code we add

Hi Transact... I was having a look at the transact code with a view to seeing what it would take to expose a sabre-compatible WASM backend in Burrow 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:03:18 GMT):<br/>
any pointers?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:08:58 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis so, we have started on a 0mq network transport for transact that will allow you to run seth
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:09:26 GMT):<br/>
oh, opposite question :)
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:09:32 GMT):<br/>
ha I think so
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:09:44 GMT):<br/>
what I am thinking is - can I compile transact and deploy it as a contract on Burrow
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:10:02 GMT):<br/>
thoughts are vague
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:10:03 GMT):<br/>
ok, so the barrier initially is going to be Go->Rust; we created a Go repo but haven't started on the bindings yet
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:10:30 GMT):<br/>
does transact run sabre, or does transact run on sabre

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:11:24 GMT):<br/>
think of transact as an API to run transactions through various smart contracts engines, like sabre and seth
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:11:47 GMT):<br/>
(though, it is also the implementation, but from a user perspective, the API is the relevant bit)
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:14:33 GMT):<br/>
So say I have a grid smart contract will that rely on Transact (and transitively sabre, say) or is it more directly dependent on sabre? 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:15:17 GMT):<br/>
It's the smart contracts/objects that work with transact/sabre that I am interested in running directly on Burrow, compiling what I need from rust to WASM
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:16:13 GMT):<br/>
(also I'll take the time to actually run transact which might make more of this clear...)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:16:23 GMT):<br/>
so, for example: say you have some initial state S0 (maybe represented as a merkle radix tree or maybe a key/value store). you can create a transact scheduler and feed transactions into it. you then give part of the scheduler to transact's executor, which will use sabre/seth to run the contracts in the context of S0. the results flow back to the application(DLT) in the form of transaction receipts, which are the state transitions necessary. the application(DLT) takes the results and uses them to update state to create a new state S1
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:20:05 GMT):<br/>
Grid smart contracts are compiled against the Sabre SDK. That SDK is currently API-compatible with Sawtooth's transaction processor API. So there is some precedent for multiple compile targets.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:20:54 GMT):<br/>
When compiled in "wasm" mode, we are compiling against a FFI (C) interface to do get/set state, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:21:45 GMT):<br/>
and then sabre implements the other side as well (the container) that marshalls those calls to sawtooth or transact's state (depending the context)
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:21:56 GMT):<br/>
okay thanks, it sounds like for this particular idea I am interested in exposing state to a sabre contract
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:22:14 GMT):<br/>
I noticed the c dependency - so are you just using the C FFI as a calling convention here 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:22:40 GMT):<br/>
you are not calling C code, or rust code via a C binding or anything?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:24:07 GMT):<br/>
right, for the calling convention. basically, it's the interface that allows the sandboxed wasm code to call outside the sandbox. the code is all rust.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:25:43 GMT):<br/>
we are using the parity wasmi interpreter, so the code outside of the interpreter is basically wasmi->transact(or sawtooth) code
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:26:22 GMT):<br/>
(I keep referring to sawtooth only because Sabre can be compiled against transact or sawtooth.)
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:27:40 GMT):<br/>
ah okay, so sounds like there isn't a direct extern wasm -- https://github.com/rustwasm/team/issues/29
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:27:49 GMT):<br/>
so I guess that's why the parity wasm works that way
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:28:09 GMT):<br/>
we are using https://github.com/perlin-network/life FWIW

</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:29:20 GMT):<br/>
so, for example, one thing you could do integration-wise is implement a new State definition (it is a trait in Transact) which is backed by something other than the merkle tree implementation, and then use sabre to run the grid smart contracts, and then take the receipts and apply them to your version of state. because your state implementation can have whatever rules for accessing state you want, you have a lot of control.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:31:26 GMT):<br/>
I wouldn't necessarily suggest replacing Sabre's implementation. we can always modify it if needed, and likely you just want to figure out the challenging state-mapping piece first anyway.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:33:12 GMT):<br/>
currently Grid is assuming the merkle-radix addresses when creating keys (as do all Sabre contracts currently), and the question becomes, what does that mean if what you want to use a different state design.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:34:53 GMT):<br/>
I would suggest starting with sawtooth xo if you want to get something working as a proof of concept. it is easy to deploy to wasm and then works like all the grid smart contracts but has easier business logic to reason about.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:35:50 GMT):<br/>
(you can deploy sawtooth xo into sabre and not use the rest of sawtooth)
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:36:11 GMT):<br/>
to explain the constraint I'm trying to thing through - I'd like to be able to run some of these contracts without introducing another process - run it all in Burrow - ideally in pure go...
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:36:17 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure how feasible that is
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:38:43 GMT):<br/>
well, Transact is written in Rust. But the ideas is that we create a good Go wrapper so that from the DLT perspective (burrow, fabric), Transact looks like a Go library (which just happens to be implemented in Rust lower down the stack). Running all in the same process should be fine--today, you compile sabre directly in so it's not a separate process.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:39:41 GMT):<br/>
yeah but then we become CGO not Go
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:40:04 GMT):<br/>
not the end of the world for sure (we are CGO if you compile us with sqlite support for Vent so there is precedent)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:40:37 GMT):<br/>
sure, same basic idea as Ursa
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:41:03 GMT):<br/>
We have machinery in Burrow that is a bit like transact, but it sounds like what you are advancing is the point of transact is to reuse that actual code, not implement something parallel
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:41:44 GMT):<br/>
but i was wondering if doing that would still provide us something worthwhile in terms of interop lower down the stack with sabre
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:41:59 GMT):<br/>
but perhaps once you take that out it really is just get/set FFI in C
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:41:59 GMT):<br/>
but perhaps once you take that out it really is just get/set C FFI
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:42:12 GMT):<br/>
which isn't much of an interop
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:42:30 GMT):<br/>
 so maybe compiling in transact as an option that writes to our merkle state is the more interesting thing to do
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:47:35 GMT):<br/>
yes, the idea of transact is a library, not a specification. we could do a sabre-related spec. but I see more collaboration happening with library sharing and using transact. in part, because then you not only get sabre support, but every smart contract engine that ever gets implemented is likely to work (daml for free, for example, and chaincode if we add support for it).
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:53:20 GMT):<br/>
if pure-go is important, we can make transact another system process (which violates the other constraint you mentioned), in which case, it just provides a service that can be used. that approach is why I have referred to transact as a "library or component" because it depends on whether you encapsulate it in a process. but if we want to go down that path, we will want to build a transact daemon 'transactd' process that can optionally be used (approach up to the DLT).
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 15:55:13 GMT):<br/>
what are the disadvantages of cgo?
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 16:00:31 GMT):<br/>
It's not ruinous, but pure-go is enough of a positive that we try and hang on to it for our standard builds, see: https://dave.cheney.net/2016/01/18/cgo-is-not-go
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 16:01:51 GMT):<br/>
It also breaks Go's pprof pretty badly which I use a lot
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 16:02:09 GMT):<br/>
See: https://rakyll.org/pprof-ui/
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 16:02:42 GMT):<br/>
If we wanted to go nuts I suppose I could compile transact to WASM...
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 16:25:15 GMT):<br/>
compiling transact to wasm isn't going to work, because transact is heavily threaded
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 16:25:42 GMT):<br/>
I assume the dependency list also wouldn't compile with a wasm target

<p><strong>AlexanderZhovnuvaty</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 10:08:06 GMT):<br/>
hi guys! Need advise on 2 questions: 

1) Does this framework support ERCXXX smart contracts? 
2) Can it be used as gateway between Fabric and Sawooth networks? 

I have a task where two communities (one work with Fabric, another with Sawtooth) should have subset of common data handled by certain rules. Assume it should be some kind of smart contract which can be used between multiple networks. 

Hope Transact can cover such requirement. 

Thanks in advance 
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 14:19:55 GMT):<br/>
@rjones I left comments on the https://github.com/hyperledger/transact/pull/13 one
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 14:30:25 GMT):<br/>
@AlexanderZhovnuvaty 1) after we add a 0mq network execution adapter, it will be possible to use transact to run Sawtooth Seth, which in turn uses Burrow
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 14:36:33 GMT):<br/>
2) neither Sawtooth or Fabric support Transact yet, it is in-progress; Transact can be used to execute Sawtooth smart contracts today if they are written in Rust, but the use-case would be running them in a separate process (like, if you were implementing another DLT or a tool); when Sawtooth and Fabric do support Transact, it will be possible to write a smart contract and then deploy it to either network (for example, deploying Sabre wasm smart contracts); if what you need to to coordinate between multiple networks, you may want an oracle process instead
</p>
<p><strong>AlexanderZhovnuvaty</strong> (Wed, 28 Aug 2019 15:25:31 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/transact?msg=9YwtvqE22hBndA4qc) Thanks! Pls point me to some documentation about what does "you may want an oracle process instead" mean?
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 17:26:14 GMT):<br/>
Hi! I am looking to get more familiar with Transact and possibly start contributing. I have seen the API docs. Are there any examples/tutorials I can try out? 
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 18:48:29 GMT):<br/>
@swetha the best "examples" in the repo are the test code. the sawtooth.rs code has a couple xo tests (it shows how to run the xo sawtooth transaction processor without modification). in particular, execute_create_xo_game() test has the basic flow.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 18:49:36 GMT):<br/>
we should perhaps add some standalone example though, because the tests are not necessarily super accessible.
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 18:51:31 GMT):<br/>
I will start there then. Are issues generally tracked in JIRA on the Transact board?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 18:52:16 GMT):<br/>
that sawtooth.rs module is behind a feature that is off by default, because we don't always want the sawtooth dependency. but if you ignore the compatibility stuff, the rest of it is the same.
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 18:57:13 GMT):<br/>
Okay, ill play around with that
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 18:57:23 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for that starting point!
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 18:57:31 GMT):<br/>
there is also the Command family - in workload::command.rs that is an implementation of a TransactionHandler. we started on an RFC for that which will explain it, I'll see if we can get it submitted to the RFC repo
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 18:59:19 GMT):<br/>
for JIRA, this is the kanban board we use - https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=232&quickFilter=621
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 18:59:54 GMT):<br/>
this is the backlog view: https://jira.hyperledger.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=232&view=planning.nodetail&quickFilter=621&epics=visible
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 19:05:30 GMT):<br/>
these sawtooth docs apply to transact, and potentially we could move over the content: https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/architecture/global_state.html, https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/architecture/transactions_and_batches.html
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 19:06:28 GMT):<br/>
some, but not all of this applies: https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/architecture/scheduling.html - the chain controller / block publisher stuff doesn't apply and the exact relationships between the components are better in Transact
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 19:07:26 GMT):<br/>
this has some content related to the receipts: https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/architecture/events_and_transactions_receipts.html

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 19:10:29 GMT):<br/>
when we start pulling together a tutorial, we can use these source sections out of the sawtooth app dev guide, but modify them to match the Transact TransactionHandler API - https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/app_developers_guide/rust_sdk.html, https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/app_developers_guide/address_and_namespace.html, and some select portions of https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/app_developers_guide/event_subscriptions.html
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 19:11:54 GMT):<br/>
of course, none of that is geared toward the DLT developer, so doesn't cover how to actually use Transact itself, only how to write TransactionHandlers and some client code
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 19:24:34 GMT):<br/>
Okay, thanks for the resources. I don't see issues marked Help Wanted currently. What is the best way to start contributing to the project?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 19:39:14 GMT):<br/>
a couple ideas: create some examples (so the next person doesn't have to dive into testing code), pull some of those docs over into the transact repo, do some performance testing and enhancements, write a state backend that works like Fabric's, start working on go bindings and/or go client code (@wkatsak has a start on Go transaction/batch building code)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 19:45:55 GMT):<br/>
then there are several core things we need to reconcile for Fabric support, such as transaction differences and receipt<->rw set/events, which might be more RFCs ("how to modify the API to support X") or even a fabric.rs compatibility module for data structure conversation
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 20:14:58 GMT):<br/>

```
unresolved import `transact::sawtooth` 
```
I am new to rust, so I am assuming I am making a mistake in terms of the module structure. Any ideas? I get the same issue if I try importing it internally such as using it in the src/lib.rs in libtransact. But there I try `use sawtooth`.

Hi, I am trying to extend the sawtooth xo create example to work with multiple transactions. I am having a little difficulty in understanding how the state changes should/are applied to the database. I have been applying the update to the database and though I am able to verify the changes are in the database, the root hash that is generated stays the same. Any ideas/tips?

The essential steps I am doing:
```
let merkle_db =
        MerkleRadixTree::new(db.clone_box(), None).expect("Cannot initialize merkle database");

    let initial_state_root = merkle_db.get_merkle_root();
    let mut writer = db.get_writer().unwrap();
    writer.put(game_address.as_bytes(), &value).unwrap();
    assert_eq!(
        writer.as_reader().get(game_address.as_bytes()).unwrap(),
        value
    );
    writer.commit().unwrap();
    let merkle_db =
        MerkleRadixTree::new(db.clone_box(), None).expect("Cannot initialize merkle database");

    let state_root = merkle_db.get_merkle_root();
    assert_ne!(initial_state_root, state_root);

<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 00:48:01 GMT):<br/>
Looks like you might need to get_merkle_root() before the second ‘let merkle_db’
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 01:05:35 GMT):<br/>
Wouldn't that give me the merkle_root of the original tree? Since it was made from a clone of the db? I might also be misunderstanding what db.clone_box() does.
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 01:07:31 GMT):<br/>
Also in my code these line are actually a helper functions that take in a db. I just copied the one in sawtooth.rs https://github.com/hyperledger/transact/blob/master/libtransact/src/sawtooth.rs#L488-L492
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 01:54:35 GMT):<br/>
That write commit should mutate the trie instance
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 01:55:18 GMT):<br/>
If you create a new instance off of the db, that instance won’t have a root set
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 03:38:09 GMT):<br/>
What is the process of getting the new root? Because merkle_db cloned an earlier version of the tree so it doesn't have the update
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 05:10:35 GMT):<br/>
@pschwarz should be able to answer this in the morning
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 13:27:02 GMT):<br/>
@swetha Take a look at the unit tests: https://github.com/hyperledger/transact/blob/master/libtransact/src/state/merkle.rs#L960

TL;DR: the `commit` function on `MerkleRadixTree` returns the new root.  You should be writing your values via the merkle tree, not to the backing database directly.

<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 16:11:08 GMT):<br/>
@pschwarz  Thanks! I will try that out. Why does the context manager take in the backing database instead of the MerkleRadixTree? I am following /expanding the example laid out in sawtooth.rs as I try to understand the end to end
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 16:34:00 GMT):<br/>
It creates MerkleRadixTree instances based on a base state root povided at the beginning of schedule. It can also be operating on multiple state-roots, backed by the same database. Since it's copy-on-write, this is safe.
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 17:09:05 GMT):<br/>
ahh, thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 17:40:36 GMT):<br/>
Is there a way to easily convert between the `receipt::StateChange` enum and the `state::StateChange` enum? I was also wondering why there are two enums for StateChange that are essentially the same. I see they have different methods implemented but don't understand why they could not be on the same enum.
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 18:14:44 GMT):<br/>
I took a look at the test you mentioned above. How does that work outside of that module? Isn't commit not public? I might be missing something simple, I am new to rust. Thanks for your help!
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 18:42:04 GMT):<br/>
I worked around it by using the MerkleRadixTree. I am not sure that was the right way to update the merkle tree.
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 19:06:50 GMT):<br/>
It's public via the `transact::state::Write` trait
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 19:07:39 GMT):<br/>
There should be a `From` implementation for those, somewhere.  If not, we should probably add one
</p>
<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 19:07:39 GMT):<br/>
There should be a `From` implementation for ~those~ the various StateChange structs, somewhere.  If not, we should probably add one
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 19:49:49 GMT):<br/>
@swetha the reason there are multiple StateChange is that the modules are otherwise independent, IIRC--the two APIs don't fundamentally depend upon each other, even if they are working with (essentially) the same data within their respective APIs; trying to keep the interdependencies clean. receipt is basically a data class that is often serialized/deserialized (similar to transaction, batch, etc.) and so emphasis on that code is backward compatibility including the serialized formats; the state code doesn't necessarily have that restriction
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 19:55:03 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @pschwarz, I didn't realize you need to import the trait specifically.

@amundson Is the `From` implementation that @pschwarz mentioned something that should be added to the implementation ? I understand trying to keep the modules independent, but I see that one would need to convert between the two often? Manually building the struct is not difficult, just seems a little weird if that is the expected process
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 20:40:33 GMT):<br/>
looking at some code which uses Transact, looks like it is doing the conversion manually. not great. we should add the From for sure, the question is were to put it (receipt or state). @pschwarz and I were discussing this briefly and we think it should probably go in the receipt module.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 20:42:28 GMT):<br/>
reasoning is basically: receipt module is already concerned with conversions (to/from protobuf), so it seems more natural that it would support the conversion to state::StateChange. this is probably better (maybe) than introducing a third module.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 20:44:43 GMT):<br/>
and, we probably only need receipt->state and not state->receipt
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 20:49:11 GMT):<br/>
Okay, I would love to send a pr in for that!
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 19 Sep 2019 20:51:36 GMT):<br/>
I have been working on expanding and extracting the test you pointed me towards earlier : https://github.com/swetharepakula/transact/blob/examples/examples/src/main.rs. I know we discussed adding examples to the repo or the contrib repo when I started looking into this, I was wondering if the example was close to what you were thinking? Any feedback would be great
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 20 Sep 2019 15:09:25 GMT):<br/>
@swetha yes, though I just took a quick look. I'll try and look deeper later and see if I have any feedback.

@amundson Have you had a chance to look at the example? Would it be easier if I opened a PR with that?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 20:45:08 GMT):<br/>
@swetha I've only glanced at it, haven't had time yet to look over it in detail. opening a PR sounds good. some initial thoughts: a) needs copyright headers; b) not sure examples should be part of the workspace (need more opinions on this); c) we probably want to leave room for multiple examples, so sticking this under examples/simple_xo/ probably makes sense. (where "simple_xo" is whatever makes sense to call this one)
</p>
<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 20:50:45 GMT):<br/>
@amundson I think where this should exist was what stopped me from making it into a PR initially cause I wasn't sure it should be in the workspace as well. I will rework the directory structure and submit a PR. Thanks! Also wasn't sure what is the typical way Transact tracks issues/PRs. For the other change I made I created a JIRA and put the jira number in the commit title, but I see that other commits don't follow that pattern
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 20:51:32 GMT):<br/>
ok, just looked at another repo we have w/examples and we do include it in the workspace

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 20:59:35 GMT):<br/>
the expectation is, basically, that the commit message should be good enough in isolation

<p><strong>swetha</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 21:00:19 GMT):<br/>
Thanks! I don't have a strong preference on adding the ticket number. I am used to Fabric and Cloud Foundry where the ticket was always in the title, so just learning what the process is here

@arsulegai based on your previous feedback, we are adding the ability to store invalid results in the receipt store - https://github.com/hyperledger/transact/pull/26
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 03 Dec 2019 04:44:15 GMT):<br/>
Storing the invalid results can be optional.. Storing the invalid transaction result becomes underlying blockchain/distributed platform implementation dependent. The end result of this could be a bloated invalid transactions in transaction receipt store.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 03 Dec 2019 04:44:44 GMT):<br/>
The other alternative could be to time the storage of invalid transactions in the receipt store.

<p><strong>slavitch</strong> (Tue, 03 Dec 2019 21:32:01 GMT):<br/>
Storing the invalid results is an error message that can be used to determine if there is s
</p>
<p><strong>slavitch</strong> (Tue, 03 Dec 2019 21:32:01 GMT):<br/>
Storing the invalid results is an error message that can be used to determine if there is some kind of attack or error in logic.  A big problem with Hyperledger in particular is the opaque nature of  the system.  An audit trail should have failures as well as successes.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 16:24:53 GMT):<br/>
storing invalid transaction results opens the network up to more DoS attacks that have to be mitigated, which is why Sawtooth's architecture doesn't store them. however, future Sawtooth or Scabbard can make different architectural decisions at that level, so from a Transact perspective, we just want to enable making that decision at the higher level.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 16:26:19 GMT):<br/>
@slavitch not sure what you mean by "Hyperledger" - did you mean a specific project?

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 16:28:23 GMT):<br/>
We are planning on starting a transact javascript SDK, waiting on repo creation. initial code is in a splinter PR now, but planning on pushing it down to the Transact layer instead as its useful generally for anyone using Transact.
</p>
<p><strong>slavitch</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 17:51:13 GMT):<br/>
Is there any documentation on authentication and access control for Transact?   My use case would have to interoperate with an external CA that provides X.509 certificates for humans signed using RSA.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 18:33:35 GMT):<br/>
@slavitch Transact operates at a lower level than those concerns (it handles transaction processing, not not decisions about whether to process the transactions).
</p>
<p><strong>slavitch</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 18:46:26 GMT):<br/>
So that's done in the Smart Contract Engines?   Can you recommend one that supports RSA signature verification, and support existing RSA-based x.509 certificates without  requiring changes to PKI infrastructure?

we are considering pulling pieces of sabre directly into libtransact as an optional feature, then making sawtooth-sabre depend upon transact for the pieces we move into transact

The Linux Foundation’s CommunityBridge engineers are working on a tool to measure the health of critical open source projects and one of the key areas identified is QA Testing.  They request that our communities provide  honest and detailed information on testing tools and methodologies you use in your projects for us to come up with a detailed analysis, which they will share with all respondents and projects. https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/9H5G2GV. It’s only 5 questions long.

we are planning to move the contract-archive feature from experimental to stable. if you want to participate in feature review, now is the time to go look at the code and comment here with suggestions.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 10:59:41 GMT):<br/>
How is that planned to be used? Is it a store for blockchain implementation to load and remember contracts uploaded?
</p>
<p><strong>ltseeley</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 13:33:20 GMT):<br/>
@arsulegai it's intended as a standard way to package/archive smart contracts. `scar` files will be accepted by tools for uploading smart contracts to Transact.

<p><strong>kodonnel</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 16:30:24 GMT):<br/>
Is there a quickstart or tour guide or something for transact?  The rust library docs are mostly a pile of facts.  What I am interested in looking at is the feasibility/effort of implementing the 0MQ (IPC based in generally really) based engine
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 17:21:25 GMT):<br/>
not anything that eases you into it, no. a lot of the Sawtooth TEP doc applies at a high-level, and there is some high-level stuff in the project proposal
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 17:23:00 GMT):<br/>
Swetha contributed the simple_xo example which is fairly simple but also needs some cleaning up in terms of thread handling
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 17:24:50 GMT):<br/>
this static adapter code is the most relevant piece of the code - https://github.com/hyperledger/transact/blob/master/libtransact/src/execution/adapter/static_adapter.rs
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 17:25:28 GMT):<br/>
Basically, we would want a ZmqAdapter in addition to that StaticAdapter
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 17:25:28 GMT):<br/>
Basically, we would want a ZmqExecutionAdapter in addition to that StaticExecutionAdapter
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 17:27:49 GMT):<br/>
My previous plan was to use libsplinter's Transport code to do this - https://github.com/Cargill/splinter/tree/master/libsplinter/src/transport -- still probably makes sense
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 10 Jul 2020 17:28:19 GMT):<br/>
there is ZMQ code there already, though it doesn't pass all the tests. I guess that would make it a TransportExecutionAdapter

@kodonnel daml has a rust sdk now right?
</p>
<p><strong>kodonnel</strong> (Fri, 24 Jul 2020 20:11:49 GMT):<br/>
There's a prototype rust based engine, but it's nowhere near prime time.  Main line is Scala/jvm based. There may be some client sdks out there but that's most likely just the grpc side of things

@amundson I have seen in the transact repo the following lines
"The transact-contrib repository contains examples and reference implementations"
But I haven't seen any commands to run or proper code in the transact-contrib repo
Could you please suggest where the sample implementation is how can I run the same?
</p>
<p><strong>supriya2385</strong> (Thu, 27 Aug 2020 14:27:09 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 27 Aug 2020 15:22:56 GMT):<br/>
@supriya2385 there is also a client sdk for javascript. roadmap-wise, it depends what you want the sdk for. currently there are no SDKs planning for wrapping the core execution code, but there are plans to expand the sdk support for clients and smart contracts
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 27 Aug 2020 15:26:20 GMT):<br/>
@ashlinSajan it should probably read "Future home of" there, but the general idea is that contrib is a space for things that aren't technically part of the transact releases. There are some examples in the main transact repo; if you share a little about your use case I can try and point you in the right direction.
</p>
<p><strong>ashlinSajan</strong> (Fri, 28 Aug 2020 04:35:31 GMT):<br/>
Hi Shawn
Thanks for your reply
I wanted to explore the transact functionality.If there is a demo example it will be more easily understandable
Is there a demo example to run and see in the main transact repo
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 28 Aug 2020 14:26:51 GMT):<br/>
@ashlinSajan There is an example here, though its handling of threads isn't necessarily the best - https://github.com/hyperledger/transact/tree/master/examples/simple_xo ; if you want a fully working distributed ledger example, you could look at Scabbard, which is a simple DLT written using Transact - https://github.com/Cargill/splinter/tree/master/services/scabbard; there is also a lot of effort/code going in Sawtooth right now to support Transact, though that isn't example-level code as Sawtooth itself is fairly complex.

hi! is there any documentation on using transact with sawtooth, fabric or any other hyperledger blockchain?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 09 Oct 2020 17:13:06 GMT):<br/>
Not as such, as Transact isn't selected at runtime by a user. Sawtooth's master branch uses Transact and Splinter's Scabbard services uses Transact. In both cases, Transact isn't optional. Both are good examples of how to use Transact, with Scabbard being the simpler of the two.

Hi, the following repos still use `master` as the default branch: `transact, transact-sdk-go, transact-sdk-javascript`. `main` [is the current guidance for naming](https://github.com/github/renaming).
