@tbenzies @bbehlendorf it occurred to me, sitting in Heathrow, that using RocketChat instead of the gotomeeting chat would be a Good Thing(tm)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:26:54 GMT):<br/>
esp now that we have searchable history
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 09 Feb 2017 15:27:12 GMT):<br/>
thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Sat, 11 Feb 2017 09:05:18 GMT):<br/>
@cbf that makes a ton of sense, we'd just have to ask people not to use the gotomeeting chat
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 11 Feb 2017 09:46:03 GMT):<br/>
agreed
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Sat, 11 Feb 2017 09:49:40 GMT):<br/>
note that I think that this would (ideally) apply to all WGs that use GTM and have voice calls... maybe we can even wean off of voice calls since we now have archived chat history

<p><strong>ShaneCurcuru</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:35:50 GMT):<br/>
As a general comment: there are too many different places for newcomers to try to look for information.  Any effort to centralizing engagement channels is helpful!
</p>
<p><strong>ShaneCurcuru</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:37:04 GMT):<br/>
For example, various groups seem to have calls, post a google doc with minutes, and then put technical pointers in the wiki...
</p>
<p><strong>ShaneCurcuru</strong> (Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:45:54 GMT):<br/>
I hope no-one minds if I do a little cleanup on the wiki...

</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 23 Feb 2017 15:29:13 GMT):<br/>
looks like there's no scrollback buffer on the chat interface there
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 23 Feb 2017 15:30:26 GMT):<br/>
was someone asking if project proposals are private?  They certainly can't be once submitted to the TSC, and probably should be made public even before then so people can discuss them (like the Sovrin / Plenum proposal I put on the proposals page on the wiki).  I do talk with people about potential proposals privately at times.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 23 Feb 2017 15:39:21 GMT):<br/>
@bbehlendorf he was asking if the internship proposals were private, I think
</p>
<p><strong>tbenzies</strong> (Thu, 23 Feb 2017 20:28:17 GMT):<br/>
As discussed on the TSC call, we are looking to hold a Hackfest on the East Coast in April.  As such, please indicate your preference on timing at http://doodle.com/poll/xwdefutqhpwsqszr.
</p>
<p><strong>ShaneCurcuru</strong> (Fri, 24 Feb 2017 16:43:39 GMT):<br/>
project proposals should definitely be posted and announced publicly beforehand.  Having a little bit of discussion before the TSC works on the proposal can definitely help.
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 17:47:18 GMT):<br/>
@cbf regarding the upcoming fabric incubation vote: are we voting for fabric-* projects or just fabric.git ?
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 17:47:49 GMT):<br/>
e.g. we have baseimage, sdk-node, composer, chaintool, etc, in the mix
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 17:48:53 GMT):<br/>
some are inseparable, like baseimage, while others could be debated
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 17:49:21 GMT):<br/>
im just curious as to the proposed scope, mostly for planning purposes around chaintool, but just in general
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 19:31:09 GMT):<br/>
@ShaneCurcuru yes, we post them typically to the hyperledger-tsc@lists.hyperledger.org and also on chat. Typically we would also allow comments in the proposal doc
</p>
<p><strong>ShaneCurcuru</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 19:32:05 GMT):<br/>
And are they put on a central wiki page as well, or at least all pointed to from one place?  
</p>
<p><strong>ShaneCurcuru</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 19:32:14 GMT):<br/>
Just brainstorming ways to grow community around new project ideas
</p>
<p><strong>ShaneCurcuru</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 19:32:28 GMT):<br/>
thx
</p>
<p><strong>ShaneCurcuru</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 19:33:34 GMT):<br/>
bonus app idea would be RC plugin bot that tried to helpfully redirect questions to #fabric or other rooms from #general.   :wink:
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 19:35:44 GMT):<br/>
speaking of which there is a proposal to have Fabric considered for exit from Incubation here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UQwQdAfK9DwTpGFQmIF7HU4YBTpx0ZG1VbdtGW1hlIQ
</p>
<p><strong>ShaneCurcuru</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 19:38:28 GMT):<br/>
Nice percentages of both committers and work done there showing the diversity.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 23:11:00 GMT):<br/>
@ShaneCurcuru Hi, I'm also of the opinion that we are under utilizing the wiki
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 23:11:20 GMT):<br/>
I've tried to add some info to it a while ago when we transitioned from github wiki
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 23:11:42 GMT):<br/>
but few people seem interested in using it much
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 23:12:27 GMT):<br/>
I'm guessing this is due to a lack of established policy as to what we put there vs in the doc and elsewhere
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 23:12:58 GMT):<br/>
I've tried to make that point a few times but I don't get much response
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 28 Feb 2017 23:13:11 GMT):<br/>
it's nice to see someone else thinks that would be good :)
</p>
<p><strong>ShaneCurcuru</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:15:22 GMT):<br/>
The real question is: where is the informational and "check daily" homepage for each specific project?
</p>
<p><strong>ShaneCurcuru</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:16:07 GMT):<br/>
That is - there's code on github, some mailing lists (which have a horrible UI for archives), and a whole bunch of RC Channels for different areas.  But where should newcomers go to see an overview?  What ties everything together?
</p>
<p><strong>ShaneCurcuru</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:16:46 GMT):<br/>
If you compare to the ASF, there, each project has OurProject.apache.org as a homepage, with pointers to every aspect for *that* project.  HL hasn't gotten to that point yet
</p>
<p><strong>ShaneCurcuru</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:17:15 GMT):<br/>
So for now, wiki information is the defacto "how can I learn more by myself easily" place until better web presence(s) are setup
</p>
<p><strong>ShaneCurcuru</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:18:07 GMT):<br/>
Part is HL staff (which I know aren't many) need to coordinate, and part is the various fabric, STL, etc. project communities need to be more organized about publicising their own projects as projects (i.e. not in their corporate homes, but under HL)
</p>
<p><strong>ShaneCurcuru</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:18:13 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @lehors  for the comments!
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:51:44 GMT):<br/>
you're welcome, very happy to discuss this further
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:52:14 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/tsc?msg=82BZM6YmipgunjQCK) @ShaneCurcuru I don't think that's really the case though
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:52:23 GMT):<br/>
at least it's not been recognized as such
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:52:41 GMT):<br/>
this is also what I think would make sense
</p>
<p><strong>ShaneCurcuru</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:52:44 GMT):<br/>
is there any place that is recognized?  Or just each project for themselves?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:53:24 GMT):<br/>
I would say that the documentation of the project is considered the primary point of entry
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:54:13 GMT):<br/>
unfortunately, it's not even exactly clear which version of the doc is
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:54:22 GMT):<br/>
we have two repos: gerrit and github
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:54:56 GMT):<br/>
you can get into the doc simply by browsing the repo
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:56:18 GMT):<br/>
for fabric we also build the doc and export it to readthedoc
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:56:28 GMT):<br/>
then there is the wiki
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:56:40 GMT):<br/>
a lot more effort is put into the doc than the wiki
</p>
<p><strong>ShaneCurcuru</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:56:45 GMT):<br/>
So that's the technical documentation about the code (which has two versions, yay!)
</p>
<p><strong>ShaneCurcuru</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:57:06 GMT):<br/>
where's the documentation about the *project*?  I.e. the community of people working on this code that creates a product that provides useful functionality?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:57:20 GMT):<br/>
I know... but that's not so bad because one is generated from the other
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:57:35 GMT):<br/>
like github is a mirror of gerrit
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:58:01 GMT):<br/>
well, there is definitely the wiki page
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:58:20 GMT):<br/>
but it's not clear what goes where
</p>
<p><strong>ShaneCurcuru</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:58:22 GMT):<br/>
where is the easily shareable URL that explains (briefly, to newcomers) what Fabric is, who is working on it, how someone new can get *involved* (not just submit a patch), and why the project is useful? 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:58:37 GMT):<br/>
you'll find project info in the doc as much as on the wiki
</p>
<p><strong>ShaneCurcuru</strong> (Wed, 01 Mar 2017 14:59:04 GMT):<br/>
I mean, HL is still pretty young as a foundation.  But this is stuff that a good foundation provides for or at least works with projects to provide, to help the community draw in new contributors.
</p>

</p>

@troyronda I am not sure of the exact procedure, but basically it would need to get on the TSC agenda and then we vote
</p>
<p><strong>greg.haskins</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 03:32:46 GMT):<br/>
in general, I am in favor of this, particularly if you plan to convert the fabric CLI to use it

@troyronda you've already done most of the work :-) All is left for you to do is to send an email to the TSC mailing list introducing your proposal and requesting for this to be put on the TSC agenda
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 09 Mar 2017 15:28:23 GMT):<br/>
then join the call to present it and answer any questions

1.Standards: Normative/Prescriptive vs Descriptive where do you draw the line? How does this relate to the Identity WG
2.Work on the Interface/Whitepaper Document for Identity- how to proceed? There have been suggestions made: start with Interfaces/Capabilities from Indy/Fabric/STL/Iroha- we need volunteers
3.How to Interoperate? Is this important in the first place?
4.Splitting the Identity space framework vs. Transactors

Identity WG Call April 19, 2016 at 12 EDT. Details in wiki link https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/identity/identity-wg.

Proposed Agenda:

Welcome new comers into the group and get reasons for participation.
Work on short term goals, identify volunteers for the following items in the paper and a timeline (we will aim for a draft of some of these items by Monday the 24th to continue work at the hackfest)
a. Current Interfaces: Description of Indy, Fabric, Iroha, Monax, STL.
b. Extract the common elements from these interfaces to describe an “ideal” Identity Interface
c. Read the Requirements WG paper and map to Identity requirements
d. Description of CA vs DiD- i.e. Central Authority vs Distributed Identity and their interoperation and how Identity component will operate in the context of Legacy systems and heterogeneous DLTs.
e. Read and get data from Architecture Working Group on Identity to incorporate or link to in our paper

Tentative Volunteers from what I remember are: Jan Kamenisch, Nathan George, Drummond Reed, Sean Bohan, Daniela Merella
If there are any I am forgetting, please speak up if you are on the call.
I will cross post this on tsc chat and architecture wg chat as well as the technical-discuss and tsc mailing lists.

@here Identity WG call today at 12 EDT. Details in wiki link https://wiki.hyperledger.org/groups/identity/identity-wg.

Paper link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ExFNRx-yYoS8FnDIUX1_0UBMha9TvQkfts2kVnDc4KE/edit?usp=sharing

Agenda:
Call for volunteers
Splitting up workload and discuss timelines:
a.Bridge to architecture WG paper – Nathan George  (since he had already started on this)
b.TEEs & HSMs – Steven from Rivetz
c.Jan Camenisch (already provided some feedback)- ZK proofs and CL signatures- maybe something more concrete
d.	Benjamin Bollen – Monax-Identity
e.	Leonard Edwin maybe Iroha-Link is
f.	Daniela Merella - She can look at the paper and contribute
g.	Fabric CA team to provide some input on Fabric CA
h.	STL EPR – (End Point Registry) https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gWlbsKtgApOTm1E5XJsw2J3U6AvIRxujWiG-vm6ELOM/edit?usp=sharing   EPID as identity repository.
i.	Sovrin-Identity Model- Drummond
j.	DiD->DDO model-Drummond
k.	X.509 (Version 3.0), X.525 ****-need volunteer
l.	Verifiable claims - Nathan/Sean/Drummond
m.	Sketch out Identity Interface- Vipin

We have to recognize the fact that this conference season and people are very busy. In fact this can be a good thing, since the latest ideas garnered at conferences can be incorporated into our paper.

Interesting paper on fuzz testing in Communications of the ACM. It is very practical with tools to generate ASNs and use ASN to generate fuzz tests to probe weaknesses of MongoDB (in particular); but this can be generalized to test any platform or interface. The title is "MongoDB's JavaScript Fuzzer" In Communications Of the ACM 05-2017, maybe this will help with setting up test frameworks for Fabric/Iroha/STL. Maybe you guys already have such frameworks and would like to expand-iterate on those.

I propose archiving the fabric-api project. It hasn't had a meaningful commit since 30-AUG-2016 https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-api/commits/master . Archiving it would mean removing the Jenkins rigging, marking the project read-only in Gerrit. The two maintainers for that project have not been active in any Hyperledger project I see since August. @hgabre @tamas @TamasBlummer .

Where can the plans for Fabric releases be found, as in what will be in the 1.0 GA release and so on?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 18:14:25 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal probably best asked in #fabric 
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 18:15:01 GMT):<br/>
yeah, tried there and fabric-questions... no responses
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 18:16:34 GMT):<br/>
the tsc is the wrong abstraction level for release cadence questions, regardless.
</p>
<p><strong>weeds</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 19:28:47 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal We have frozen feature capabilities.  We are in process of test and defect fixing.  Once we reach the exit criteria, we will cut the release.  The maintainers (people like @cbf @JonathanLevi who are running the release this round) would be best to ask.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 19:30:16 GMT):<br/>
Thanks. Also, #fabric-release and the "internal maintainers" #fabric-maintainers should provide you with a lot of related info.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Wed, 31 May 2017 20:00:11 GMT):<br/>

Hi, @baohua .  I know this is late, but the TSC has not changed from gotomeeting.
</p>
<p><strong>tbenzies</strong> (Thu, 08 Jun 2017 22:02:29 GMT):<br/>
As discussed on the TSC call, we are looking to hold a Hackfest on the East Coast in the August/September timeframe.  As such, please indicate your preference on timing at http://doodle.com/poll/e6qgduebztu3rvac.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 01:15:22 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt yes, i open both, and see it's using gotomeeting. Do u know is there any migration plan to the uberconference? Or we will not change? :)
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 09 Jun 2017 16:01:53 GMT):<br/>
For now, it will remain on GoToMeeting, @baohua

1. Eligibility for electors for tsc, identity working group participants.
2. An analysis of confidentiality & privacy topics as it relates to identity: We will use the base paper https://www.r3.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/survey_confidentiality_privacy_R3.pdf, this is a public paper from the R3 site.
3. Legal & regulatory underpinning for Identity- we will continue the discussion with reps from the Government sector (infrachain) and possibly a legal expert, may not happen until next meeting (August 9)
4. Verifiable claims (possibly with help from our friends from Indy/Sovrin)
5. Hope to have reworked material from our prior meetings as well as other contributions into the White paper. (mainly biometrics, Legal, use case around key management presented by Oskar DV)
6. Please take another look at the biometrics paper that Danny Bathen @berserkr  produced. He presented four weeks ago. Please enter comments for https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YaQo5Yd2ooDurKhL_iGWkHO5KuNFA9L50GkXCs3LqeA/edit We need to aborb the salient points into our whitepaper.

We have a solid lead on a good location in Lisbon, Portugal, with two date options: October 26th-27th or December 5th-6th.  We had guidance from the TSC that late October could work for everyone, but given a number of other conferences going on in October and November, and it being only a month after the US Hackfest, we'd like to know your availability and preference for both dates.  Please go here to let us know: http://doodle.com/poll/vfsnabcykec62wr6.

Hi! Can you please help me with DCO check in iroha-api repo? It seems that signed commits are still rejected: 
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 18 Oct 2017 20:08:06 GMT):<br/>
In the sawtooth repo I think we got false positives from the DCO check when someone signed a commit using a different email address than they had associated with github. Could be something like that. You might compare the sign-off to the user details.  
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 19 Oct 2017 06:58:10 GMT):<br/>
Okay, I will do that. We cannot update the docs until this is resolved :(
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 19 Oct 2017 14:42:11 GMT):<br/>
@neewy could you create a pull request instead of pushing directly to master? I think we get better errors that way
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 19 Oct 2017 14:55:35 GMT):<br/>
No
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 19 Oct 2017 14:55:40 GMT):<br/>
I cannot push code :(
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 19 Oct 2017 14:56:17 GMT):<br/>
Maybe I will update it manually in GitHub, but this is a huge pain
</p>

@neewy the meeting was earlier today. I'm not asking you to update anything manually on github. I'm asking you to fork iroha-api into your personal github account, add a remote to your existing clone, and push there. the manual step would be creating a pull request in the GitHub UI - which is one button click

Dear all,
Previously this week in a meeting a client has proposed us an specific scenario where some code snippets would be sent through a Tx payload. This code would be useful for the SDK to read it later and perform an action.
I know that is a closed scenario, but how does it sound as a future development branch? Would it be feasible and useful an scenario like that?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 02:07:06 GMT):<br/>
That sounds like a smart contract. Burrow supports that. 
</p>
<p><strong>gut</strong> (Fri, 27 Oct 2017 06:57:54 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @Dan. Certainly it'd be like a small smart contract persistent for some reason. But with the difference that it'd be accessible/executable from an outer system. I'll check Burrow implementation

Hello again. We've been recently working on [blockchain-explorer](https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/admin/projects/blockchain-explorer) deployment. I think I can make a contribution, but I don't know if it's intended for the project design. Who can I contact to know if it is a valid contribution? I think that is better to discus it prior to a simple pull request.

If Chris Ferri' comment means:
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 09:23:49 GMT):<br/>
11/20/2017 

Several panelists support the view that permissionless blockchain technology will win out eventually, but in the meantime companies will continue to cling to permissioned or private blockchains as the safer option. For example, Chris Ferris, Governing Board Member & Chair, Technical Steering Committee, Hyperledger, said that his group focuses on private blockchains because if something goes wrong it’s possible to identify the other parties involved and use the legal system if necessary.


</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 09:26:18 GMT):<br/>
My opinion is that the permissionless blockchain will eventually disappear or play a minimal role. Why? When more people start to understand the negative aspects of permissionsless blockchains, particularly to the society at large, they may well become an outcast.
</p>
<p><strong>SjirNijssen</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 09:27:02 GMT):<br/>
If another quote of Chris was mentioned please identify.

<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 18:04:17 GMT):<br/>
The quote is here:  https://blog.sweetbridge.com/when-blockchain-and-wall-street-meet-9a86e3804237
"In this context, it was very interesting to hear Chris Ferris, Chair of the Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee and IBM CTO Open Technology, who said that it is very possible that in the future Hyperledger will switch its focus to public permissionless infrastructure for its use cases."

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 18:05:54 GMT):<br/>
would like to hear more comments from @cbf himself :grinning: 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 18:17:24 GMT):<br/>
so, I cannot recall exactly what I said, but I have been fairly consistent in making the case that the path that blockchain takes will be somewhat similar to the path that cloud has taken. Initially public cloud was shunned by enterprise, because of concerns over security, thinking that they could do a better job of securing their data, etc. and hence the trend (at that time) towards private cloud.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 18:17:51 GMT):<br/>
over time, enterprise became more comfortable with public cloud and now it seems that that is the predominant trend
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 18:18:15 GMT):<br/>
with blockchain, same thing... concerns over running on public/permissionless networks for obvious reasons
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 18:20:54 GMT):<br/>
over time, I think that there will be some applications that work fine without complete permissioned access and that eventually there will be permissioning and privacy/confidentiality supported on public networks (alongside permissionless and anonymous) 
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 18:21:01 GMT):<br/>
that's what I meant
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 18:21:20 GMT):<br/>
I think that there will always be a case for permission
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 18:21:31 GMT):<br/>
(e.g. known identity)
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 18:43:10 GMT):<br/>
@cbf Thanks for the clarification...  Regarding Public cloud, for many applications public cloud is just fine, but for many others, data residency issues make them difficult to leverage.  As for the analogy, a significant difference is public cloud issue was around security, which one could argue who can do a better job, on premise or public cloud.  Identity is another beast altogether with AML/KYC regulations.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 10 Jan 2018 20:02:34 GMT):<br/>
for privacy on public networks, we may need to take advantage of technique like zero-knowledge, but seems there's no practical enough solution yet.

Question:  the text says that we don't require stewards to do a technical review.  While I don't want the stewards to have to do a conference review, should we suggest that they at least do some kind of sanity check to make sure the project at least has a chance of working?  We might want some kind of minimum bar.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 15:31:46 GMT):<br/>
@hartm can that responsibility be taken by the sponsor?
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 15:31:58 GMT):<br/>
otherwise the sponsor is really just a "name"
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 15:32:15 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 15:36:38 GMT):<br/>
is there any incentive for a sponsor to "do a good job" to vet the project?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 15:36:52 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sold on requiring commits if we already have sponsorship.  We might have people who are clearly outside experts on blockchain who want to participate (i.e., a well-known bitcoiner wants to try out some new technology)--we don't necessarily need to make this people go through the ropes of committing.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 15:38:03 GMT):<br/>
i'm comfortable with the assumption that individuals in the list of potential sponsors are incentivized by the overall success of HL

Sign in blood!  Now we're talking.

<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 15:52:18 GMT):<br/>
great work @lehors 
</p>

thanks

@lehors I see the advantage of RC

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 15:53:54 GMT):<br/>
Since I was absent for most of the call
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 11 Jan 2018 15:54:05 GMT):<br/>
ah! very good

hi there
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 14:54:42 GMT):<br/>
I don't mind but looking at the agenda makes me wonder whether it really justifies having a call
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 14:54:47 GMT):<br/>
it seems pretty light
</p>
<p><strong>tbenzies</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 14:57:30 GMT):<br/>
i think too late to cancel at this point -- so, we can just move really swiftly through and give folks some time back
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 14:57:46 GMT):<br/>
swift silent and blocky
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 14:57:54 GMT):<br/>
maybe not silent

We'll have some discussion about Working Group reports, but perhaps that will be brief.

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:02:54 GMT):<br/>
As you know any of these topics can take off
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:03:12 GMT):<br/>
and consume the full 1 hr
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:03:50 GMT):<br/>
indeed
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:04:32 GMT):<br/>

You
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:04:55 GMT):<br/>
there were talks about trying to have at least one rep for each project
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:04:57 GMT):<br/>
noobs like us
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:05:18 GMT):<br/>
it would be good to try and get that sorted out

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:06:24 GMT):<br/>
LGTM but we need names of people committed to cover those topics
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:07:06 GMT):<br/>
cant we have parallel tracks according to interest
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:07:28 GMT):<br/>
hmmm
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:07:50 GMT):<br/>
I think that you really don't need to do both getting started and dev env
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:07:59 GMT):<br/>
@hartm should we add an agenda item for the crypto library?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:08:12 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, we need people committed to presenting each of these.  And I'm also curious about parallel tracks--not sure that people are going to want to set up three environments...
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:08:23 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman Yes!
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:09:11 GMT):<br/>
maybe something in between would be best
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:09:19 GMT):<br/>
a series of intro
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:09:33 GMT):<br/>
and then in parallel some deeper dive sessions
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:09:47 GMT):<br/>
What if we introduce the projects in the morning and then have parallel tracks for setting up dev environments/applications/etc. in the afternoon?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:10:01 GMT):<br/>
@lehors +1!
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:10:10 GMT):<br/>
yeah, I think we're converging :)
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:10:22 GMT):<br/>
If people want to peel off to work, the experts won’t get a chance to onboard with the other projects (for example it would be good for me to set up Fabric and Sawtooth environments)
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:10:43 GMT):<br/>
landing your first commit may also be part of the intro morning talks, since that will be same for each project (in theory)
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:10:59 GMT):<br/>
morning is common and broad, afternoon is parallel and project-specific?
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:11:18 GMT):<br/>
or slightly in parallel - maybe one track with three, a second track with another three, a third track with the three remaining
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:11:23 GMT):<br/>
but each project uses different approaches to submitting patches
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:11:46 GMT):<br/>
fabric and cello use gerrit, others github some use jira others not
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:12:00 GMT):<br/>
Yes, Chris pointed out some PR differences when we were in Lisbon. I
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:12:16 GMT):<br/>
I'd actually like to understand those better so we can cross pollinate best practices
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:12:25 GMT):<br/>
Maybe we can sort that out before LA though.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:12:38 GMT):<br/>
+1
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:13:34 GMT):<br/>
good stabbing @tkuhrt 
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:15:05 GMT):<br/>
I don't know that we need to split application devs from regular devs--we'll probably have some people that aren't interested in coding period, and we should have something to accomodate them (maybe a presentation on techniques and applications?).
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:19:47 GMT):<br/>
Working group updates make total sense.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:20:10 GMT):<br/>
sorry about the noise in my background, I'm at a big conference
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 Jan 2018 15:20:40 GMT):<br/>
no worries

@tbenzies what is the number and diversity of current registrants
</p>
<p><strong>tbenzies</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:13:58 GMT):<br/>
for Hackfest?  33 registered -- which is great for 1 month out.  diversity on what metrics?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:14:16 GMT):<br/>
company/geography etc.
</p>
<p><strong>tbenzies</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:14:23 GMT):<br/>
let me have a look when call wraps up
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:14:24 GMT):<br/>
LOL.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:16:15 GMT):<br/>
@Dan who developed the Edx material?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:18:39 GMT):<br/>
As far as hackfest diversity, I'd be more interested in what sort of skill set/experience/interests the people that are coming have.  This will help us plan the agenda better.
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:22:02 GMT):<br/>
@hartm do we still need any more work on the crypto project to get a proposal out? i haven't heard since Lisbon, but i've been missing architecture meetings
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:22:36 GMT):<br/>
i think i added an agenda item for that @binhn

<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:24:13 GMT):<br/>
@lehors do we have anything like a "template" for HL labs projects?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:24:27 GMT):<br/>
nope
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:24:56 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman @lehors we should make a variant of HIP
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:25:05 GMT):<br/>
template
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:25:16 GMT):<br/>
I'm wondering what the best approach is
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:25:32 GMT):<br/>
the idea was to use github and have requests submitted via a PR
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:25:35 GMT):<br/>
@Dan great progress in sawtooth!
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:25:45 GMT):<br/>
thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:25:49 GMT):<br/>
but we should still have a form of template for the PRs I guess

cool
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:27:31 GMT):<br/>
as a starter I would suggest a PR with a README.md file explaining what the lab is about
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:27:48 GMT):<br/>
Lift from Hyperledger labs material
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:28:01 GMT):<br/>
I thought each lab got its own repo?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:28:05 GMT):<br/>
already presented by Tracy- I was thinking about this as well
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:28:23 GMT):<br/>
yes, you're right Dan
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:28:39 GMT):<br/>
so, we still need to figure out the exact mechanism to use
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:29:37 GMT):<br/>
README.md is a good idea and habit
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:30:00 GMT):<br/>
labs projects don't have a lot of requirements... but we should capture the "sponsor"
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:30:13 GMT):<br/>
errr... "capture" --> "document" :-)

</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:41:25 GMT):<br/>
just saying ;-)

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:41:56 GMT):<br/>
@lehors evidence is you are still typing
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:42:25 GMT):<br/>
that's my point vipin!
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:42:32 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:43:03 GMT):<br/>

yes! :)
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 25 Jan 2018 15:45:01 GMT):<br/>

Hi channel, I'm seeking a little orientation on what work/thought may have already been undertaken on cross-chain communication in the sense of:

A: Atomic exchange of transactions between (separate instances/deployments of) chains of the same type (i.e. Hyperledger projects)
B: Transaction (um) 'fungibility' between chains of different types (e.g. mapping a fabric transaction/payload to a sawtooth one and having it run there with the same underlying logic)
C: Atomic exchange of transactions between chains of different types

Regarding A and C, I know that Fabric has a channels mechanism - I think Sawtooth probably does (?), not sure about Iroha. I don't know how applicable same chain type channels/subnet/zones notions might be to facilitating cross-chain communication with some form of consensus guarantees. In a most basic form a single client could claim a transaction on chain X, then send the equivalent transaction to chain Y (using some B-like ability). Some kind of distributed lock could be used to ensure consistency but it would still be a single point of failure.

My particular interest is in building various types of compatibility between chains with the Ethereum virtual machine as the broker of that compatibility. In particular for the upcoming EVM support in Hyperledger projects - in Burrow, Sawtooth, and Fabric. I have in mind a few layers of possible compatibility:

- EVM bytecode portability - where we aim to be after the basic integration in Seth/Fabric stabilises.
- Transaction portability - where we could deliver EVM payloads, basically CallTxs, in a native format to a particular chain - this would give a migration path and the ability to develop against multiple 'ledger backends' but wouldn't synchronise heterogeneous running networks.
- Atomic swap of transactions - simplest form is a single client claiming a distributed lock between two chains and sending the complementary state updates to both, ensuring those transactions commit before releasing the lock.
- Shared consensus layer - something like Cosmos - where we have some protocol level way of committing transactions with a below quorum voting (i.e. for some transactions votes by just those validators on the hub are sufficient - chain is a light client for some remote transactions). Hopefully we could have a formally quantifiable drop-off in fault tolerance guarantees for consensus on remote transactions.

Anyway I wanted to make sure I was aware of any existing work, with a view to proposing a discussion on this area (possibly a working group) and maybe use it as basis for some cross-team hacking in future hackfest...

Oh perhaps also some 'why':
- To support multiple vendors that provide this level of interop (weaker than what seems to be being proposed by EEA)
- To provide migrations of live state
- To shard based on chain capabilities/usage
- To shard based on participant visibility
- To decentralise networks across projects not just servers

the way that open source works, if you want something, roll-up your sleeves and dig in ;-) Basically, what Simon is saying is that the maintainers would be open to contribution that integrated another DLT platform
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:18:15 GMT):<br/>
Simon has been consistently against anything other than GitHub for about everything
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:20:09 GMT):<br/>
So for composer to support another DLT the DLT must be able to run smart contracts written in JavaScript?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:21:24 GMT):<br/>
I think that's right
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:21:31 GMT):<br/>
Unless there is a translator like they had for go<->js
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:21:36 GMT):<br/>
Also, with github issues, there is no support for confidential security bugs. To adhere to responsible disclosure and the internet infrastructure initiative rules, we need to have a confidential security bug process.  
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:21:56 GMT):<br/>
because the core engine of Composer is installed as the chaincode/smart contract

@lehors i think the existing run-time support is still golang-based chaincode inside the network?
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:23:13 GMT):<br/>
i.e. the `core-engine` you mentioned
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:24:08 GMT):<br/>
it'd be better to ask Simon but that's not my understanding
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:25:06 GMT):<br/>
Composer used to install itself as chaincode using a Javascript VM written in go
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:25:21 GMT):<br/>
now that Node.js is supported as chaincode, they use that instead
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:25:23 GMT):<br/>
yeap
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:25:25 GMT):<br/>
which is much faster
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:25:42 GMT):<br/>
Gotcha
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:25:48 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the clarification. 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:26:19 GMT):<br/>
aha, then the dashboard uses node sdk to interact with the node js chaincode, right? 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:27:49 GMT):<br/>

Simon Stone

as long as you can run JS (either via node.js or an interpreter) composer should be portable to that DLT

</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:30:24 GMT):<br/>
> aha, then the dashboard uses node sdk to interact with the node js chaincode, right?

yeah, all the composer client components (Node.js APIs, REST APIs, web playground, app generator, etc) use the Node.js SDK to call the Node.js chaincode
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:31:53 GMT):<br/>
also, nothing about the design of composer means that it's JavaScript and JavaScript only... someone could port all the code to Java or whatever
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:32:04 GMT):<br/>
but that's a much bigger piece of work then just getting the existing JS codebase up and running
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:32:07 GMT):<br/>
@lehors It installs Composer runtime as chaincode (Golang - for `Fabric 1.0.x`, NodeJS  - for `Fabric 1.1.0-alpha`)

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:32:45 GMT):<br/>
@sstone1 and @dhuseby  [ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/tsc?msg=S2HX37f7Nv8yXBuP5) I believe it really depends on how much we or others want to invest here.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:33:19 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I agree - having another language is not an issue, the porting is easy.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:33:22 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:33:34 GMT):<br/>
@hartm that feature is in the next version of the chat server. a ticket to upgrade this server to support that feature is in the hopper.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:33:59 GMT):<br/>
If we really want to have cross DLT support, then I would actually suggest that we "sit down" and review the API.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:34:01 GMT):<br/>
I thought single dlt based efforts were deprecated as full incubations- however I am afraid that decision (or rather direction) came after Composer was incubated
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:34:41 GMT):<br/>
Maybe we can make it easier for other DLTs to work well with Composer (in a way that is only easy for "Fabric", or so).
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:34:47 GMT):<br/>
@rjones Awesome!  It's annoying to wake up and not know whether someone has asked me a crypto question deep in chat or someone is just spamming "here"
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:34:49 GMT):<br/>
Just thinking out loud. Not hinting at anything.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:36:02 GMT):<br/>
Maybe an abstraction layer or so? Happy to list out requirements.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:36:08 GMT):<br/>
So incubations that either a. create a brand new dlt or b. aim to be be usefull across multiple dlts as libraries would be used

@sstone1 - I'm not volunteering you or bringing in more work ;-) I'm just trying to see what's potentially needed to bring more people "over".
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:36:58 GMT):<br/>
we have an existing abstraction layer already - we needed to build one to handle Fabric v0.6 vs Fabric v1.0, and running in-memory and in a web browser without Fabric
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:37:20 GMT):<br/>
80-90% of the Composer codebase does not know it's talking to Fabric
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:37:21 GMT):<br/>
@hartm, in channels like identity and architecture and tsc- "here" is useful for general announcements
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:37:31 GMT):<br/>
And by the way, we at HACERA, actually extended that layer for a project last year (2017)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:38:00 GMT):<br/>
Maybe we can collect some requirements for that layer, is what I meant (from non Fabric DLTs)
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:39:13 GMT):<br/>
oh, sure
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:39:17 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB That's true in theory, but in practice it's not what it is used for.  
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:40:23 GMT):<br/>
Beware of broad generalizations and removal of features for one purpose, it depends on the channel (the traffic, members etc.) so it should be settable on a channel basis @hartm

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:43:13 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:54:25 GMT):<br/>
Also @hartm if it helps the notification icon for "here" will be just an outline with a number, however the one for actual name mentions is a background color so in theory (and in practice) you can distinguish the mention just by looking at the notification. Also @rjones thanks!

<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Tue, 20 Feb 2018 19:10:21 GMT):<br/>
OK, I think we have a solution for the SSH/IMAP block, Todd has a bunch of 1-day access codes for unfettered access, but it's complicated (requires a unique name & password and registering for an account) so if you need it you can see him for it. He's off getting the list printed out.

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 16:49:14 GMT):<br/>
@bbehlendorf does the linux foundation have a policy on copyright notices in headers? I don't see anything in our HLP charter. 
@TomBarnes suggested this Apache guidance http://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html#headers to remove copyright notices from source and place them in a NOTICES file.
Further it appears from examples that it is not a copyright that goes in the NOTICES file but a statement like "This product includes software developed at..."
Finally some files (e.g. build scripts) have meta fields for things like "Author". Should those be removed? If not or if they cannot be removed is the appropriate author "Hyperledger Project"?

</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 01 Mar 2018 16:00:21 GMT):<br/>
Indy released a 1.0 shortly before joining Hyperledger, so I've been trying hard to prevent version number inflation as we complete our incubation tasks.  We have been avoiding a declaration of Hyperledger GA until we have a reference agent and better support the open standards we're developing at the W3C, but I think technically we're just missing CII badging and some procedural requirements.

kelly_: having lived through that case, I like the idea of being incubation while you solve any branding, tooling or process issues before declaring GA, but it means that like JonathanLevi stated in the call GA triggers the marketing and other Hyperledger support, rather than the 1.0 moniker, at least for projects that have the issue described.

I think if we have a separate registration form for the hackfest and the day 0, then this will help filter the groups.

I think the 3-day meetings are good--if we have to travel, most people won't mind staying an extra day, particularly if it means less travel overall.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:16:24 GMT):<br/>
we really need to agree on whether this a 0-base index or 1-base index (re Day 0,1,2 or 1,2,3) :-)

I think Silas is saying he might want to go to 1.0? I lost audio
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:46:35 GMT):<br/>
yes... It's something that I would like to have the option to do a few releases after this refactoring
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:47:31 GMT):<br/>
is our zoom session in limbo?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:47:56 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:47:56 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:48:01 GMT):<br/>
I can hear Jonathon
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:48:25 GMT):<br/>
did you guys hear what I said?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:48:38 GMT):<br/>
about the current state of things
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:48:54 GMT):<br/>
@lehors this is what active entails 
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:48:56 GMT):<br/>
Projects seeking to graduate from Incubation must:

have fully functional code base
have test coverage commensurate with other Active projects
have an active and diverse community of developers
have a history of releases that follow the Active release process
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:49:07 GMT):<br/>
so I think we would all agree that most of those would be required for 1.0
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:49:16 GMT):<br/>
the only open question is around active and diverse community
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:49:29 GMT):<br/>
How is diversity measured today? @kelly_ 
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:49:54 GMT):<br/>
the fabric and sawtooth included stats on # of contributors/PRs from different companies
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:50:24 GMT):<br/>
that's the main question though
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:50:38 GMT):<br/>
do you have to have a broad community to have a 1.0?
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:51:07 GMT):<br/>
could we make it that a project either needs to a) be an active project, or b) get tsc approval?
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:51:27 GMT):<br/>
once we 'bless' something as 'active' it seems like we are signing off that the project has good governance
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:51:30 GMT):<br/>
a small team could very well have produced a quality piece of code that is worth labeling 1.0
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:51:35 GMT):<br/>
Projects supported by Smaller companies are at a disadvantage
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:51:53 GMT):<br/>
Yeah +1 to @kelly_ and @lehors.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:51:54 GMT):<br/>
+1 lehors
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:52:03 GMT):<br/>
the 1.0 designation of a HL project carries at least some of the blessing of HL
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:52:16 GMT):<br/>
that should imply... viable HL project
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:52:19 GMT):<br/>
how about a tsc sponsor is required for 1.0
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:52:23 GMT):<br/>
or x number of tsc sponsors
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:52:31 GMT):<br/>
so they are putting their name on the line with regard to quality
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:52:36 GMT):<br/>
with code and community and all "gates" passed for HL blessing
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:52:40 GMT):<br/>
"blessin"
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:52:44 GMT):<br/>
my zoom client and/or connections is in limbo - I get fragmented pieces of audio
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:52:46 GMT):<br/>
+1 also what Chris is saying, to linking exit-incubation with release-1.0 creates an odd sort of deadlock - should a pre-1.0 be allowed to leave incubation?
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:53:15 GMT):<br/>
if the code is mature... and the community is mature... then the process will be accelerated
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:55:23 GMT):<br/>
Majority of tsc have to vote @kelly_ - so sponsor is moot
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:56:11 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB for active status, not for 1.0
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:57:48 GMT):<br/>
if anything I think it's clear that we need not to jump to making a decision :)
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:57:54 GMT):<br/>
@kelly_ seems like what you are asking for will be difficult for amsller projects with no real tsc member involvement
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:58:01 GMT):<br/>
smaller
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:58:19 GMT):<br/>
We may take a look at other community like openstack, Apache. Whether there is requirement of 1.0 on the incubation exit.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:59:05 GMT):<br/>
we need to get a clear and shared understanding of what active means and what 1.0 means and the dependency between the two if any
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:59:19 GMT):<br/>
@lehors agreed
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:59:23 GMT):<br/>
based on the discussion so far I don't think we are there yet
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 15:59:58 GMT):<br/>
active to mean means good governance and good processes
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:00:14 GMT):<br/>
1.0 is a measure of code quality
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:00:19 GMT):<br/>
to me*
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:00:33 GMT):<br/>
yes I agree with that
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:00:41 GMT):<br/>
and compliance (e.g. open source compliance, security review, etc.)
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:01:14 GMT):<br/>
So far we seem to be OK with active projects declaring 1.0 on their own (as with fabric and sawtooth)
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:01:24 GMT):<br/>
I think the active conditions are necessary but insufficient for the 1.0 conditions
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:02:00 GMT):<br/>
 [ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/tsc?msg=viZdTfEwvNneJscjd) @Dan can you please explain why?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:02:18 GMT):<br/>
why is it necessary?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:02:19 GMT):<br/>
So @Dan ergo you cannot go to 1.0 without being out of incubation. 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:02:29 GMT):<br/>
Is that what you are saying
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:02:49 GMT):<br/>
yes. or stated negatively.. can you claim that you are production ready if your commit process is erratic, you don't have CI, you don't ...
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:03:02 GMT):<br/>
what if you ahve all that but not an 'active or diverse community'
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:03:07 GMT):<br/>
I think that is the only point of contention
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:03:20 GMT):<br/>
what if you have all that sorted out but you don't have a diverse community?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:03:34 GMT):<br/>
I have not yet seen a true measure of diversity
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:04:06 GMT):<br/>
well in that case the bar for diversity is low and therefore active status should be required :)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:04:10 GMT):<br/>
at least kelly and I are on the same wavelength ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:04:18 GMT):<br/>
:)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:05:35 GMT):<br/>
so, maybe the conditions isn't so much to be "active" but to have those things sorted out
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:06:31 GMT):<br/>
I think it is highly desirable to also have a "diverse community" but I don't see that as a necessary must have
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:07:17 GMT):<br/>
well maybe we take that into account in a proposal to become active?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:07:48 GMT):<br/>
A small project that is making clear efforts to grow its community could be active?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:07:57 GMT):<br/>
no, I wouldn't want to dilute what becoming active means
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:08:15 GMT):<br/>
I think we'd remove a big incentive for people to work on growing their community
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:08:27 GMT):<br/>
true
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:08:41 GMT):<br/>
but in a way, preventing them to also issue a 1.0 release is hitting them twice for the same thing
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:09:34 GMT):<br/>
maybe we can say that if a project is active they automatically qualify for 1.0 release for project in incubation they have to get tsc approval?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:09:34 GMT):<br/>
maybe we can say that if a project is active they automatically qualify for 1.0 release, and for projects in incubation they have to get tsc approval?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:10:51 GMT):<br/>
that could work
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:11:05 GMT):<br/>
@lehors saves the day
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:11:22 GMT):<br/>
definitely mull that over until next thursday
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:11:23 GMT):<br/>
as part of the tsc approval process we could ask the project to document how they meet all the other criteria related to having proper engineering practice (test-suite etc)
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 16:28:18 GMT):<br/>
Diversity (according to what I can see in project reports for Fabric/Sawtooth) is measured as number of committers/Maintainers and their companies... (based on emails I think). But this does not really measure the contributions, since that is tougher to measure (you could count lines committed- but that could be an absurd measure), even someone who committed something insignificant once is counted as a committer. Just mulling over a true measure of this, since it seems to be given a lot of prominence in this process. What are the communities thoughts on this?

I have a keen interest in graduation requirements being formalized.
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 17:17:30 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB I think diversity is an aspirational thing. I agree with Dan that it is a risk mitigation thing, let's make sure that HL isn't a marketing vehicle for a project dominated by a single company, and let's make sure that one company doesnt determine if a project lives or dies
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 17:18:18 GMT):<br/>
I think it's critical that a project is open and has a clear process on contributing/ becoming a maintainer. and that they follow through on that by working with teh community to integrate PRs etc.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 17:18:40 GMT):<br/>
Surely I agree with this @kelly_ 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 17:19:14 GMT):<br/>
However, reality does not jell with this. starting with the diversity of the tsc
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 17:19:35 GMT):<br/>
beyond that, at this point in the 'enterprise blockchain' space i think contributors are going to be driven by a financial motivation e.g. some sort of product offering
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 17:19:49 GMT):<br/>
it's not public ethereum where you get to see your code added to an open project
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 17:20:10 GMT):<br/>
so I think it's unreasonable to expect that we will have a lot of random contributions at this point in the tech lifecycle
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 17:20:54 GMT):<br/>
as these projects move into production then consumers of the technology will be motivated as well, not just sellers of the technology
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 17:20:58 GMT):<br/>
I just don't think we are there yet
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 17:21:18 GMT):<br/>
This diversity is more in working groups where the problems are more generic
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 17:22:08 GMT):<br/>
Not tied to the commercial aspirations of one company... There are also smaller projects that could ignite like quilt or burrow
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 17:22:55 GMT):<br/>
So i'm leaning a little bit more towards making the requirements for an active project less onerous with regard to established diversity as long as the other requirements are met, and making active status a requirement for 1.0
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 17:22:59 GMT):<br/>
at least where my head is at now.
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 17:23:35 GMT):<br/>
There is also this chicken and egg thing, active projects and 1.0 projects get more interest and therefore have a higher chance of getting new contributors
</p>
<p><strong>cca88</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 14:40:51 GMT):<br/>
Hello TSC - In which forms does Hyperledger support academic efforts and initiatives?

More concretely, is there sponsorship for relevant research events, for example, conferences like CRYPTO (crypto.iacr.org/2018/) , PODC (www.podc.org) or workshops (www.blockchain-workshop.net) ?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 14:44:40 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 16:08:25 GMT):<br/>
@cca88 We have talked about putting together a working group for something like this.  Historically there hasn't been that much overlap between Hyperledger folks and places like crypto, and this is something we should probably change.  As Vipin pointed out, Marta (@mpiekarska) is trying to put something together around this.
</p>
<p><strong>cca88</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 19:29:58 GMT):<br/>
thanks both. I'll connect with Marta, I'd be glad to help with this.

<p><strong>compleatang</strong> (Wed, 14 Mar 2018 00:38:43 GMT):<br/>
I really enjoyed catching up on this discussion regarding formalizing the path to 1.0 (and/or out of incubation). It has been on @silasdavis and my minds lately. For those that do not know me, I mostly lurk in this room, but I work with Silas at Monax. 

I'd like to highlight how difficult the diversity metric is for small teams to achieve. Even those that have good (we hope) engineering practices and are doing things "correctly" in terms of trying to build a community of contributors. The reality is that it is a heavy burden to shepherd the pipeline of users one would eventually hope to convert into contributors.

There is a very small world of engineers that can effectively contribute to these codebases. As an example, we have a new engineer we're about to onboard who has dozens of substantive contributions to the kernel, years of distributed database experience, and I expect it will be 2-3 months before he's able to contribute substantively. And that will be working on burrow full-time and sitting next to Silas every day.

While I'm 100% for sustainability of the Hyperledger codebases, and while I also understand that this is a tricky issue, I do think that there should be a practical avenue for a smaller team to get to a 1.0 without having to meet a relatively arbitrary diversity metric that I'm not entirely sure is meaningful pre-1.0. In that (pre-1.0) phase, the signal is that a codebase is in incubation / not ready for production / may go away / etc. As Kelly noted, contributors to Hyperledger codebases are almost always doing so for a business reason. This means that there needs to be a business reason to contribute, and it is quite hard for small teams to get other teams to see that business reason without the "mark" of 1.0. 

Genuinely not trying to moan; sorry for the long post; and thanks for letting me lurk. 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 14 Mar 2018 12:14:57 GMT):<br/>
Yes to chime in here, I think the diversity of contribution metric is the only thing I would have a problem with - CI, testing, design, code review I am fine with being a requirement. It may make sense to codify that going 1.0.0 in incubation is non-standard and should be taken into consideration in the 1.0.0 process, but I think decoupling them makes sense. Also, I'm in believer in 'just enough process' - do we need a hard requirement here - are we fixing something that is broken?

As I think it was @lehors put it we don't want to punish a project twice for the same thing or create a catch 22 as @kelly_ implied. My main concern is on the functional aspects like CII. Since this diversity condition is the main sticking point though, we should give it some thought. Are there conditions we can apply that maintain the spirit of the rule without raising an unnecessary or counterproductive barrier?

</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 14:43:05 GMT):<br/>
I like @lehors suggestion that 1.0 before leaving incubation needs tsc vote otherwise not
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 14:44:33 GMT):<br/>
The only thing that incubation requires that wouldn't be relevant for a 1.0 is the "contributor diversity" requirement.  So this discussion is really just a referendum on what we, as a community, think about small pojrects.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 14:44:38 GMT):<br/>
Having diversity is a sore point, since diversity is not truly measured... especially for smaller projects
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 14:47:37 GMT):<br/>
Diversity is not measured properly even now...not effectively 
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 14:48:49 GMT):<br/>
Do we require carrying an incubation notice in a README.md?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 14:50:53 GMT):<br/>
@JonathanLevi sounds like you are agreeing with @lehors

</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 14:53:22 GMT):<br/>
if it passes the tsc
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 14:54:24 GMT):<br/>
Indeed - I think we can state this explicitly (that a TSC vote is needed for 1.0)
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 14:54:32 GMT):<br/>
No @tkuhrt that is not what it means- if project becomes active it needs vote- 
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 14:54:40 GMT):<br/>
Some project is going to index versions with the busy beaver function!
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 14:54:45 GMT):<br/>
Not @JonathanLevi  that is a power grab
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 14:55:03 GMT):<br/>
How so?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 14:56:03 GMT):<br/>
Because, if 1.0 is needed before exiting incubation vote is needed
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 14:56:13 GMT):<br/>
Otherwise not

</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 14:59:47 GMT):<br/>
Did 1.0 always require tsc approval?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:00:09 GMT):<br/>
In that case this whole discussion was a waste of time
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:00:53 GMT):<br/>
no it did not :)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:01:30 GMT):<br/>
I'm just worried that by deferring the vote for a later "major release", we will be in the same situtation
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:02:00 GMT):<br/>
(of needing to define/evaluate maturity, community, impact, etc.)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:02:26 GMT):<br/>
For me, 1.0 is a big thing (currently)
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:03:22 GMT):<br/>
In that case, @Dan the discussion of whether the 1.0 release could happen while in incubation was turned around to requiring tsc approval for 1.0 period (whether or not in incubation), hence my use of the words power grab
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:03:48 GMT):<br/>
Sure, sure, the "power grab" thingy is understood.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:04:06 GMT):<br/>
Now, if we allow a "1.0" during incubation, we need to figure our what does "1.0" will mean.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:04:34 GMT):<br/>
Sure, but what about 1.0 after incubation- meaning in active status
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:04:35 GMT):<br/>
And or, whether people would like to suggest an alternative to the current "1.0" status
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:04:35 GMT):<br/>
And whether people would like to suggest an alternative to the current "1.0" status
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:04:57 GMT):<br/>
This did not need tsc approval according to @Dan, now it does
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:05:25 GMT):<br/>
So effectively the debate has been turned around and stood on its head
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:05:32 GMT):<br/>
We haven't made any change/decisions = so "back in the good ol' day" == "now()" ;-)

</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:06:24 GMT):<br/>
Yes you have- if you require tsc approval for 1.0 AFTER exting from incubation (which always required tsc approval)
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:06:24 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:07:00 GMT):<br/>
And the terms of the debate that has been raging for a couple of weeks
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:07:16 GMT):<br/>
Currently 1.0 is a big thing (let's call it the Ace of Spades card). If we allow "inflation", than I want to know what is the new "Ace"
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:07:45 GMT):<br/>
I suggested that vote, so that we can block the inflation of projects that don't qualify as 1.0
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:07:45 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:08:08 GMT):<br/>
Again, unless, we re-define the significance/meaning of 1.0.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:08:24 GMT):<br/>
That's my view at least.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:09:20 GMT):<br/>
And my view is that the result of this debate was misinterpreted to require tsc approval for 1.0 period at the last moment
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:10:57 GMT):<br/>
Thankfully we can have different opinions on this topic
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:11:44 GMT):<br/>
Sure - I don't think we have concluded anything.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:12:22 GMT):<br/>
I think that it's not bad to have the TSC protecting the brand.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:12:30 GMT):<br/>
Obviously you trust people to have considered what going to 1.0 means- even when you started incubating the project- you had some trust in the contributors

<p><strong>smcnamara</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 15:56:04 GMT):<br/>
FWIW I think 1.0 and progress beyond incubation are somewhat orthogonal. To Vipins point if the project was ok to start and has sufficient community, process and progress then it gets TSC approval. After that the progress from 1.0 and beyond is up to the community.

<p><strong>smcnamara</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 16:19:20 GMT):<br/>
To me 1.0 is the start of a project, not the end. It suggests sufficient features, maturity and absence of egregious bugs that you could reasonably use it in your work. 
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 15 Mar 2018 17:28:16 GMT):<br/>
Would it make more sense to have some sort of "TSC Production-ready stamp of approval" that projects can seek out?  We could tie all of the marketing efforts, etc. that are currently tied to the 1.0 release to this and make seeking this approval totally optional--you just wouldn't get all the extra stuff without it.  This way we can also deal with "legacy" numbering systems for projects.

if we bring in a project that is focused on extending one platform it will be very difficult to expect that project to add support for other platforms... there is very little motivation... sawtooth explorer is reflective of the fact that its easier (in this case) to start from scratch than to integrate... starting from scratch allows for customization...

I don’t think the question is “what is the reality of a cross-project explorer?”  Is it realistic to have a cross-project charter if no one steps forward to make it cross-project?  (and how long would we wait to see if it will naturally emerge before admitting that promoting it project status outside its framework was a distraction more than a benefit)

The task of extracting real contributors is more difficult .. Maybe should be 1. On meeting notes for at least the prior two or three calls as having attended 2. Actually contributed to discussion or paper or any other work product. Not just on the mailing list.

As discussed on the TSC call, we are exploring the possibility of scheduling a Hackfest in tandem with an industry event this fall.

As such, please indicate your interest in either, both, or neither of the following dates/locations.

The "chair writes down the active participants" method seems to work for the TSC elections (with the recourse that people can complain to the TSC if they think they are excluded).  Would this work for working group elections?
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 05 Apr 2018 14:25:00 GMT):<br/>
Is that right? I thought it was a vote by people who have commits in HL repos
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 05 Apr 2018 14:26:12 GMT):<br/>
@kelly_ , it's also "active" working group contributors.  I also think the "commits in HL repos" can be abused as well, but to my knowledge no one has done it yet.  One maintainer could probably hijack the election....
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 05 Apr 2018 14:28:48 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 05 Apr 2018 14:29:19 GMT):<br/>

@mpiekarska that is how AllSeen Alliance did it for the TSC. The quorum would go down, and you wouldn't regain your right to vote until you attended so many subsequent TSC meetings.

yeah, can count the `show-up` person in a past period (e.g., 3 months or half year) for the working group. In many open-source community, project election is for the code committer in that year.

@cbf to answer your question about long mailing list names - lists.*.* for all LF CP are one mailman host, so the list names need to be unique. I know that's an implementation detail, but you asked, and that is the answer.

@rjones I was more interested in shortening the redundant hyperledger-* e.g. instead of 'hyperledger-fabric@lists.hyperledger.org" we could have "fabric@lists.hyperledger.org" and "sawtooth@lists.hyperledger.org" etc
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 05 Apr 2018 16:47:53 GMT):<br/>
@cbf yes. We agree. Previously, one list named fabric would preclude any other project from having a list called fabric. Once we're on groups.io, that goes away.

i think i've lost the thread... what question are discussing? it seems like there is 1) should composer go 1.0, 2) should we just escalate the active discussion, 3) should we approve composer as active? 
</p>

comments seem to be going back and forth...
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:21:35 GMT):<br/>
Mic: core question is approval for Composer 1.0.  
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:22:21 GMT):<br/>
@bbehlendorf i'm aware of what is on the agenda... we seem to have... "complicated" that question
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:39:32 GMT):<br/>
i certainly think composer is mature enough to warrant the security scan
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:40:48 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:40:53 GMT):<br/>
If supportability is a 1.0 requirement, is something considered supportable if there isn't a diverse enough community of developers?
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:41:45 GMT):<br/>
thats a great question @toddinpal 
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:42:14 GMT):<br/>
I feel pretty comfortable that Composer is mature and has been developed with a process open to new contributors/maintainers. However, based on Brian's comments we should think about what the minimum community requirements are before becoming 1.0. For example, if Ripple (or whoever) starts an incubated project next week, and wants to go to 1.0 the following week because it's mature, would that be sufficient?
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 14:42:57 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal yea, 1.0 for an open source project does seem to signal something different than for a proprietary 1.0
</p>

TSC members, I have a process question. How do I get `ci-management` into `incubation` status? It pre-exists many of the other projects operating under the Hyperledger aegis.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Apr 2018 21:21:02 GMT):<br/>
When I look here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/community/project-lifecycle it isn't clear what state `ci-management` is in
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 01:05:43 GMT):<br/>
ummm what's in ci-management? :insert sheepish emoji here:  Is it intended to be a releasable project?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 01:23:05 GMT):<br/>
it is the jenkins CI repo. If you use jenkins.hyperledger.org, you use `ci-management`
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 01:24:24 GMT):<br/>
@Dan it kind-of pre-exists all of the other repos in gerrit. It really doesn't fit in to the project lifecycle. it doesn't have use cases, etc, so it can become active.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Fri, 13 Apr 2018 01:40:59 GMT):<br/>
@rjones i agree with chris's suggestion, and i guess it's safe to remove all `Hyperledger-***` naming prefix from those mail lists?

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:13:58 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, I'm just curious if we should have a separate track for the "business" people for those that don't want to take out their laptops.

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:29:05 GMT):<br/>
Another question for LF legal: I've heard some questions about if a contribution is to add "copyright hyperledger..." is that assigning copyright (i.e. giving up the contributors copyright)?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:30:18 GMT):<br/>
We have also had a case or two where contributors assigned their copyrights to the Sovrin Foundation inside Indy, which means tracking through headers alone has been tricky.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:30:46 GMT):<br/>
Yeah same problem with Sawtooth & Intel. Non-intel contributors thinking they needed to add that intel copyright.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:30:46 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:31:50 GMT):<br/>
if we have the license header, do we need copyright description at the same time?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:32:31 GMT):<br/>
I expect that the Linux Foundation has a little experience here. :)  I imagine they can give some clear guidance.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:32:49 GMT):<br/>
In our case, they actually donated their copyright to the Sovrin Foundation, rather than just confused the header, but then do we go back and change the existing headers?  What if more than one org has edited the file, etc...
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:32:58 GMT):<br/>
@dan @nage did the contributions get merged in with the wrong copyright?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:33:19 GMT):<br/>
hmm
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:33:21 GMT):<br/>
In our case, no, I do not believe so.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:33:49 GMT):<br/>
I requested a change in the PR. I don't recall if that one was merged yet.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:34:21 GMT):<br/>
sounds like a probot needs to exist for license checks
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:34:25 GMT):<br/>
@baohua Apache 2 template has a copyright line at the top.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:34:43 GMT):<br/>
yes, that's why i ask the question
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:35:08 GMT):<br/>
if we include apache license info in the header, no need to duplicate the copyright info?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:35:12 GMT):<br/>
I think it's a matter of size of change: if the change was significant the contributor could claim copyright
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:35:29 GMT):<br/>
My legal opinion is that you should sign a unlimited power of attorney to me, and I will take care of *everything* for you. :D
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 03 May 2018 14:35:34 GMT):<br/>

Additional opinion according to knowledgeable people (read patent lawyers) who I spoke with yesterday, will be to obtain some kind of provenance and DCO (Digital Certificate of Origin) for all incoming work, which then translates to safety for all outgoing streams when additional statements in all public venues state that continued participation (new work in the form of new code, patches etc.) are undertaken under Apache 2.0. Obviously to be clarified by counsel that we have retained.

</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 10 May 2018 14:35:02 GMT):<br/>
yeah, maybe the header should be something like Copyright: <URL> where the URL points to the relevant COPYRIGHT file 
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 10 May 2018 14:35:25 GMT):<br/>
@lehors that needs to be able to survive forever, though; URLs expire
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 10 May 2018 14:35:39 GMT):<br/>
whatever header line should be include, hopefully it should be implemented automatically, e.g., use git commit hook to check and add missed header info when submit.

When I visited China at the beginning of the year, a suggestion was made to do maintainer roadshows that would connect the maintainers of the different projects to the people in China who wish to contribute to the project.

+1 to the roadshows.  I think people would probably like to meet some of the "big names" that they associate with the projects.  China would probably be a great place to try this out.

Question about scope: Have ever been a proposal to make a Hyperledger client app? My team has been discussing today about the possibility to migrate the API functions to a client, like a general purpose DApp (maybe a desktop app or browser plugin), and it could be maintained through an open project. Maybe any of you know a technical problem. Or it's just out of project scope, because it would be considered a custom app at App Layer (ref: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/community/scope).
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 17 May 2018 14:00:09 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 14:37:26 GMT):<br/>
Maybe instead of saying:

Issues
*There are some issues at this time for certain functionality not available in Fabric Node SDK that we are working around.*

</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 14:39:13 GMT):<br/>
*There is some added functionality that we would like to add to the Hyperledger Explorer project (such as a node's health-check and/or performance matrix), which rely on some functionality which, once added to the Fabric Node SDK, will be highly beneficial. We are reporting and logging such requests and requirements via Hyperledger's JIRA and following closely.*

<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 14:40:08 GMT):<br/>
@Pardha Is this a correct summary for what you reported today regarding the issues? ^^^
</p>
<p><strong>Pardha</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 14:42:43 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>Pardha</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 14:43:53 GMT):<br/>
I would categorize health check/performance metrics as improvements.. not issues :)
</p>

<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 14:54:01 GMT):<br/>
JIRA query language... that sounds seriously scary
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 14:54:44 GMT):<br/>
Also, when we say check in to Github... shall we start saying "check in to Microsoft" ?
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 14:56:01 GMT):<br/>
It may indeed be easier to start with a new JIRA project from the "get go"
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 14:56:14 GMT):<br/>
Especially as we don't have that many labs (for now)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 14:56:14 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rjagadee</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 14:58:37 GMT):<br/>
+1 on Jira for labs as an experiment. 
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 14:58:55 GMT):<br/>
We should make sure that the Jira project has the "labs-" prefix
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 14:59:07 GMT):<br/>
unless we go with a single labs project
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 14:59:27 GMT):<br/>
Yes, let's prefix everything with "labs-"
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 14:59:47 GMT):<br/>
Or a "lab-..." even
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 14:59:47 GMT):<br/>
Unless labs prefix makes issue tracking messed up if the lab becomes a project.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 15:00:00 GMT):<br/>
agreed labs-JonathanLevi
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 15:00:18 GMT):<br/>
Hey, I have incubated ! ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 15:00:28 GMT):<br/>
have you? ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 15:00:39 GMT):<br/>
Well, more or less ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 15:00:50 GMT):<br/>
We're pretty deep in the HL bowels for someone to come along and mine into jira and get confused on what's a lab. i.e. that's quite a bit different from a webpage listing labs alongside projects.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 15:00:56 GMT):<br/>
BTW: JIRA projects will need like a 3 or 4 letter alias
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 15:01:21 GMT):<br/>
I have a list of 4 letter words.
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 15:01:37 GMT):<br/>
FAB... ...BUR.... QUIL....
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 15:02:06 GMT):<br/>
So we can't prefix the JIRA project name, but we can prefix everything else
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 15:02:59 GMT):<br/>
I have to go, btw, but how about we summarize as follows:

Labs that want a JIRA project (even though Github/MS is easier to start with) - we will go ahead and support
</p>
<p><strong>JonathanLevi</strong> (Thu, 07 Jun 2018 15:03:39 GMT):<br/>
If we see either that there are too many labs (== JIRA overhead)... or too much demand for Github vs JIRA... then let's re-revisit.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/tsc?msg=yF8XP2izEqW7AoB64) @abraham Hi, at what time did you try to call? According to RocketChat you're in the Beijing timezone, which would put the call at 10pm.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 15 Jun 2018 09:18:32 GMT):<br/>
the info on the wiki is correct
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 15 Jun 2018 09:20:45 GMT):<br/>
I added a link to a time converter hoping this helps
</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong> (Fri, 15 Jun 2018 10:59:31 GMT):<br/>
thanks for your editing. i will keep trying next Thursday. 
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 05:24:50 GMT):<br/>
@abraham the entire community calendar can be found at https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=linuxfoundation.org_nf9u64g9k9rvd9f8vp4vur23b0%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=UTC+8
</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 10:02:41 GMT):<br/>
the link you sent is different from the schedule from https://wiki.hyperledger.org/community/calendar-public-meetings 
</p>
<p><strong>abraham</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 10:03:52 GMT):<br/>
and all of meeting schedule was NOT specified Time Zone.  That's not efficient notice. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 10:11:13 GMT):<br/>
@abraham I apologize for the oversight.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 11:38:01 GMT):<br/>
@baohua The link you posted shows them in my local timezone, UTC-8. I added a functional link to the wiki page. This link: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?mode=AGENDA&src=linuxfoundation.org_nf9u64g9k9rvd9f8vp4vur23b0%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Asia%2FShanghai will show times in CST even if your default timezone is something else.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 11:38:30 GMT):<br/>
basically, Google Calendar defaults to your local time zone when you give it an invalid one.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 13:14:15 GMT):<br/>
thanks for the correction, ry! @rjones seems the calendar changed its grammar...
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 13:25:11 GMT):<br/>
@baohua yes they did. It broke our plugin and any links to existing calendars using that syntax.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 13:38:20 GMT):<br/>
https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?mode=AGENDA&src=linuxfoundation.org_nf9u64g9k9rvd9f8vp4vur23b0%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=*EST* for Eastern standard Time (New York and East coast of USA)
Three letter abbreviations can be found here: https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/  
Since these three letter abbreviations are not unique they can cause problems. For Example CST maps to both Central Standard Time as well as China Standard Time, so best to use UTC relative time (UTC+8) or something like Asia/Shanghai
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 13:52:55 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB it defaults to _your_ timezone. When I click the link you just posted, it shows up in pacific. CST? Pacific. EST? Pacific. The three letter codes don't work (or I couldn't get them to work)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 13:53:42 GMT):<br/>
I tried URL encoding the +, adding UTC+08 and UTC%2B08
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 20 Jun 2018 13:53:47 GMT):<br/>
 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

<p><strong>tbenzies</strong> (Thu, 05 Jul 2018 14:25:43 GMT):<br/>
we also include the list of WG Chairs and collect from each a list of individual "WG Contributors." There should also be a dispute resolution process where an individual who believes they should be included (but was not) can appeal to the WG Chair and Hyperledger Technical Advocate(s) with the final determination left to Hyperledger staff.

</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 05 Jul 2018 15:05:12 GMT):<br/>
Regarding the Community calendar, the ical option does not work well. If you are using something like outlook, you can download a snapshot of the calendar but if the meetings are updated or canceled there's no notification. Perhaps that's automatic if you are using google calendar but maybe only google calendar?

I joined right in time for the close :)

<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:25:37 GMT):<br/>
Hi everybody. 
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:26:15 GMT):<br/>
So we have a Jira consultant onsite working with the Fabric team and we received a presentation on confluence yesterday. 
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:26:43 GMT):<br/>
If you have questions, please ask here or in the tsc mailing list. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:27:31 GMT):<br/>
I question how much effort non-Iroha, non-Fabric users are going to have to put into learning a new platform
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:28:00 GMT):<br/>
I think the current plan is to ask them for migration tool information and for us to enumerate the cost of switching both literal and mental. 
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:28:43 GMT):<br/>
The rate of downloads of Fabric binaries and images continues to average just under 100/day
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:28:48 GMT):<br/>
How do you know that
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:28:51 GMT):<br/>
@cbf 
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:28:58 GMT):<br/>
@rjones we should look at the number of active wiki users to judge that impact. If very few people are using wiki outside of the Iroha and fabric teams then the concern is lessened. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:30:36 GMT):<br/>
@neewy they use a URL obfuscator to collect statistics, you can see that in the instructions
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:30:41 GMT):<br/>
Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:31:16 GMT):<br/>
Are the instructions available in the repo of Fabric? 
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:32:23 GMT):<br/>
@dhuseby I would assign someone to explore possibility of transition and estimate that. One good feature of Confluence cloud is commenting function and the other is an integration with mobile app
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:32:54 GMT):<br/>
Maintainers just love to track the state and comments and updates with push notifications in the app.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:37:24 GMT):<br/>
that Iroha and Fabric maintainers are super excited about this is nice, but we need community consensus about switching.
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:44:31 GMT):<br/>
Sure. But please try to check if 1) we are eligible for a free infrastructure and platform 2) explore if switching is that demanding at all or there is an export functionality

If we need help of someone from the community — let's state this so that people can volunteer and help
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:45:33 GMT):<br/>
And I think that if it takes for so long we definitely need someone to help us prove or disprove that migration is really a long process or not
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:46:36 GMT):<br/>
is this about switching the wiki?
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:47:08 GMT):<br/>
Are there any proposals how to move further with that? Maybe we can create a chat or would you like to continue in email thread?
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:47:17 GMT):<br/>
@Dan yes
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 12 Jul 2018 14:47:50 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 14:28:05 GMT):<br/>
PoET2 just reduces the SGX requirements.. there's some SGX features that aren't on all platforms yet. However this also would make it easier to expand to other TEEs.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 14:28:34 GMT):<br/>
this feature is important, and hope it remains similar performance

absolutely

<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 14:32:19 GMT):<br/>

@Dan I noticed your comment on editing the wiki. The Iroha and Fabric teams are pushing to switch to confluence. Will you take a look and talk about it in your team?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 14:34:48 GMT):<br/>
@dan yeah, confluence looks much more powerful esp the integration with JIRA and I think might facilitate your RFC process as well

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 14:41:38 GMT):<br/>
This seems like a really worthwhile thing to do, but is it in the scope of an actual Hyperledger project?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 14:42:28 GMT):<br/>
not really
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 14:42:43 GMT):<br/>
the scope is technology, not applications
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 14:42:52 GMT):<br/>
we approved DBE Core into Labs
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 14:43:06 GMT):<br/>
I am thinking that this should be considered for Labs by Tracy and company
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 14:43:17 GMT):<br/>
was Vipin a Labs steward?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 14:49:37 GMT):<br/>

@dhuseby sawtooth maintainers have not been active on the wiki. I guess I could have mentioned that in the update. We feel like maintaining the sawtooth docs is the main focus and a wiki only adds another place for redundant info to follow out of shape.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 19 Jul 2018 14:59:01 GMT):<br/>
TBH we haven't used it for much more than a place to host the roadmap

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 26 Jul 2018 14:29:41 GMT):<br/>
In light of the current discussion, I think the Iroha doc would gain from being updated: http://iroha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#how-is-it-different-from-the-rest-of-hyperledger-frameworks-or-other-permissioned-blockchains
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 26 Jul 2018 14:32:49 GMT):<br/>
In particular, I suspect the statement "Iroha is the only ledger that has a robust permission system, allowing permissions to be set for all commands, queries, and joining of the network." is pretty controversial and in any case isn't in line with the idea just discussed of focusing on highlighting what problem a framework is addressing
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 26 Jul 2018 14:35:32 GMT):<br/>
Interesting.. is Iroha essentially a relational database (as opposed to most blockchains are key:value stores)? 
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 26 Jul 2018 14:40:18 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 26 Jul 2018 14:40:25 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 26 Jul 2018 14:40:42 GMT):<br/>

I appreciate Marta filling in. I think the health of a working group is better, though, if one of the community participants / chair gives the report. I imagine this is a one time conflict, but I would just want to avoid setting precedent that LF staff delivers project or wg reports.

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 14:17:31 GMT):<br/>
 Vipin makes a good point here--we probably don't want this group to have a hostile relationship with other working groups.  Can we add in points in the charter that suggest the mission is to help other working groups?
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 14:22:19 GMT):<br/>
There seems to be two pieces of the proposal: 1) creation of a dashboard for quantitative metrics re: community health and 2) a task force to experiment/discuss ways to improve community adoption
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 14:22:40 GMT):<br/>
1) seems more like a repository that could be created for hyperleder-labs or others that would be useful for all projects
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 14:23:00 GMT):<br/>
right now maintainers need to pull metrics around contributors, companies, mailing list metrics, rocket chat messages, docker pulls, etc. etc.
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 14:23:19 GMT):<br/>
so I can see an opportunity for re-use there across the projects
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 14:24:09 GMT):<br/>
I know the Sawtooth team has some scripts that would be useful to contribute, I suspect Fabric and Hyperledger staff do as well
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 14:29:04 GMT):<br/>
There are probably also some metrics that would be good to understand more broadly than what is captured by individual maintainers. A set of macro metrics re: Hyperledger as a whole. e.g. geography, gender, ethnicity, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 14:31:24 GMT):<br/>
I think there's a good opportunity to bring in SMEs in these areas. Like how contributing is not just for coders - we need tech writers, ux designers etc. This is a good place to bring in HR specialists. Can our member/contributor companies lend experts in this fields like they are in the others. 
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 14:35:38 GMT):<br/>
@Dan Yeah, I agree with you--I think the charter needs to be reworded so that it sounds less adversarial and focuses more on these things.

@sstone1 out of time to ask my question, but could you provide some thoughts on DAML vs the modeling language in Composer?
</p>
<p><strong>sstone1</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 14:56:34 GMT):<br/>
i'll defer that question to @dselman ;-)

thanks
</p>
<p><strong>dselman</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 14:58:04 GMT):<br/>
DAML is an execution language. CML is a cross-platform schema language. It explicitly tries to separate the structure of the data from the operations that you want to perform on the data. 
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 14:59:04 GMT):<br/>
so one could use CML to generate DAML
</p>
<p><strong>dselman</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 14:59:09 GMT):<br/>
DAML is also not OSS AFAIK
</p>
<p><strong>dselman</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 14:59:21 GMT):<br/>
You mean this: https://daml.com
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 14:59:43 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 15:00:34 GMT):<br/>
isn't attracting more contributors a general challenge for all open source projects?
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 15:00:37 GMT):<br/>
yes, i was thinking about DA's work
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 15:00:57 GMT):<br/>
obviously you always have many more users than contributors
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 15:01:05 GMT):<br/>
There are a host of such languages like Ivy for example
</p>
<p><strong>dselman</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 15:01:11 GMT):<br/>
Here are some example CML models: http://models.accordproject.org which should give you a sense.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 15:01:20 GMT):<br/>
I think the only thing I would have hoped the Composer dev community had done differently in the last few months is air some of these conversations and concerns about the approach publicly on the composer mailing list,even at the risk of appearing uncertain or weak.  There is a lot of good thinking and POV-sharing that goes on into any decision about product futures, and that shouldn't be locked up in the heads of just the few core developers.  Always assume there are more smart people than you know out there whose input or, hopefully, willingness to contribute to a solution can be tapped into.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 15:02:05 GMT):<br/>
But as @dselman  notes they are not OSS
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 15:02:27 GMT):<br/>
Modeling is a tough problem
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 15:03:03 GMT):<br/>
I also wanted to note that any software product whose userbase target is non-technical (think Firefox or OpenOffice) has challenges in getting those users to be willing and able to cross over from user to contributor, let alone to maintainer.  There may have been more we could do to encourage the small docs or bugfix contributors to become more actively involved, but this is always harder than, say, getting new devs for a javascript framework
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 15:03:04 GMT):<br/>
Hope to speak more about this @dselman 
</p>
<p><strong>dselman</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 15:03:14 GMT):<br/>
I believe that there's a lot of value in separating CML from Composer. It will allow all the projects to use CML to model assets, participants, transactions etc and to have a consistent serialization to JSON and schema validation. This could drive a lot of interop between the projects.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 15:03:14 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/tsc?msg=C5Q453CMQNjDM4A8s) @bbehlendorf for what it's worth I only found out about this very recently myself so I agree - companies tend to be shy about this kind of stuff but I don't think it is for good reasons
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 15:03:53 GMT):<br/>
As part of the future-of-composer discussions I'd love to see people thinking about other dev tooling in the blockchain ecosystem: Truffle, for example, Metamask, Web3.js, etc.  Or even other IDEs and dev toolkits.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 15:04:39 GMT):<br/>
But I do think anyone interested in this thread should discuss it on the composer mailing list, and from there we can figure out if it's about rebooting Composer, finding new devs to continue iterating Composer, or time for a new project
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 30 Aug 2018 15:05:20 GMT):<br/>
And @dselman very interested in what you can bring to the picture - I will follow up on private notes but don't make me a bottleneck :)

This is an important point, if we expect cross project effort we will need contributors that want to put in that effort for their own reasons.  Dave has done a good job reaching out to the Indy community on this.

Reference to paper about building community using Quadratic Voting incentives: most of this is heavy stuff (Economics dressed up to look like science) but there are some interesting observations on open source and crypto in particular; I suggest skimming through until you find interesting text. Particularly interesting are observations about open source communities and amplification of the voice of "the little guy" https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243656

@VipinB I didn't get through the signup wall there yet. Could you summarize the part of open source communities that peaked your interest?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Wed, 12 Sep 2018 14:58:08 GMT):<br/>
@Dan - I will certainly do a summary of the key findings that piqued my curiosity- May take some time-hopefully soon

approving this working group seems like a low risk to me. we've all agreed that improving the health and diversity of the community is a priority, we have a proposal and people willing to go help in this area. so I'm not sure what the big risk is? that we have an update once a quarter on their progress in the TSC
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 14:26:09 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 14:58:00 GMT):<br/>
I bet we could cut the amount of time we spend on concalls by 2/3rds by adopting more async processes via email or version control.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 14:58:35 GMT):<br/>
agreed @bbehlendorf 
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 14:58:55 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 14:59:35 GMT):<br/>
I appreciate how concalls are a sort of forcing function to complete a report or discuss a certain issue
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 14:59:52 GMT):<br/>
there were a lot of long quiet periods

<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 14:59:53 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 15:00:34 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 19:07:02 GMT):<br/>
+1 to async processes. I also think it adds more transparency
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 19:07:33 GMT):<br/>
while people can go back and listen to a concall that is recorded, reading a chat log would probably 10x faster
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 13 Sep 2018 19:23:30 GMT):<br/>
+1 to this discussion.  We should definitely require TSC members (and others) to read the quarterly reports in advance.  It should be more of a Q&A rather than a presentation, and if there are no big concerns, "no questions" is certainly a valid option.

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 14:17:35 GMT):<br/>
OCI seems promising, where docker is an important contributor.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 14:19:42 GMT):<br/>
(commenting here since I'm getting dropouts calling in from china) the community health work should be a TSC-chartered working group (or call it task force, though there's no meaningful difference between the two AFAIK) rather than a GB-chartered one, as these are not issues the devs can kick upstairs but instead are core to how we work and what we do.  
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 14:20:54 GMT):<br/>
GB could provide some guidance if asked, of course.  But they aren't active or expected to be active on the level of these issues as often as the TSC is
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 14:21:26 GMT):<br/>
last thing y'all want will be the GB being tempted into micromanaging the projects
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 14:22:34 GMT):<br/>
Even the TSC shouldn't be micromanaging, but if interventions are required (positive or negative) it'll come across better coming from an elected group of devs than from the GB
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 14:22:52 GMT):<br/>
when you get into the measurement of diversity, then gender, race and nationality come into play - I think that this is what dan is referring when noting that there may be GDPR concerns around sharing that
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 14:23:12 GMT):<br/>
we definitely need to get guidance on this from board and legal
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 14:23:20 GMT):<br/>
Sorry I'm on Croatian 2g... Suggesting a generic effort to collect and aggregate what happens to be measurable is _probably_ a good thing if doing so does not prima facie imply such metrics are important 
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 14:23:27 GMT):<br/>
all within what a TSC-chartered WG/TF can do
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 14:25:29 GMT):<br/>
I would note that it is also what the TSC is supposed to do
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 14:25:43 GMT):<br/>

Regarding Comm. Health, the thing I don't know how to do is measure what our diversity is. That's a precursor to identifying and fixing any issues. I've convinced myself that the right people to do that measurement are HR specialists .. they know how and the laws around how.

our greatest challenge is to gather requirements from all of the projects that will hopefully use the crypto-lib so that we can make a clean interface that doesn't get in the way of adoption

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 14:51:35 GMT):<br/>
I think that an obvious top level taxonomical thing I would like to see on the metrics an upfront distinction between how platforms  deal with the CAP and FLP theorems, which end up being related for blockchain a since we mostly trade availability. I always tend to ask of a blockchain, if finality then where is partial synchrony entering? If message complexity scales linearly with nodes where are random choices being made?

I'm not sure why H1 is popular. I went around with tptacek about this
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:04:01 GMT):<br/>
H1 organizes the bug bounties for lots of large companies like Netflix and Twitter
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:04:08 GMT):<br/>
that's why H1 is a thing
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:04:34 GMT):<br/>
I don't think they offer much to us other than a payments processor
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:04:46 GMT):<br/>
even their report tracking is not ideal for us
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:05:06 GMT):<br/>
i would much prefer that we use JIRA instead just to eliminate the extra layer of indirection
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:05:21 GMT):<br/>
I get that they are popular. I don't see the value.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:05:34 GMT):<br/>
we can integrate H1's platform with our JIRA so that we can coordinate payments of bounties tied to JIRA tickets on our JIRA
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:05:53 GMT):<br/>
@rjones my recommendation is along those lines
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:05:57 GMT):<br/>
That Netflix and Twitter make bad choices doesn't mean we need to jump off the bridge, too.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:06:17 GMT):<br/>
it's really the payment processing in 30 different currencies and a handful of cryptocurrencies that is the real value there
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:06:47 GMT):<br/>
but I'm curious to see if we can do payments processing through a different provider
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:06:53 GMT):<br/>
@cliveb it is
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:06:56 GMT):<br/>
like, maybe somebody in our community?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 20 Sep 2018 15:07:49 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 14:32:34 GMT):<br/>
Yes @silasdavis our group in Sovrin is more use case focused.  It is an interesting question on how to keep general verticals on the same page (other IGs will have to wrestle with similar issues, as Dan points out).
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 14:36:02 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 14:45:26 GMT):<br/>
A special interest group, that is supported by a mailing list and rocket chat channels, and zoom meeting availability that is not required to report out to the TSC would be one way of enabling such conversaions in the broader community
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 14:45:58 GMT):<br/>
but that will diminish the impact... if its too separate then there is no opportunity to communicate results
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 14:47:04 GMT):<br/>
true, hence a general user-case group might be a good start.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 14:47:11 GMT):<br/>
which is more flexible
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 14:47:13 GMT):<br/>
+1 to the substantial value of these groups.  It helps the projects understand their use cases and just as important, it helps these spaces understand our projects.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 14:47:20 GMT):<br/>
right but the WG as proposed is more about use cases than it is about developing a deliverable that makes the case against use of crypto-currencies because they can be used to facilitate drug and human trafficking
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 14:47:45 GMT):<br/>
(that's just for argument sake)
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 14:47:59 GMT):<br/>
the deliverable can be something like the best technical practices to adopt hyperledger techniques.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 14:48:01 GMT):<br/>
The question is how to govern them and support mutually constructive output
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 14:48:22 GMT):<br/>
and even whitepapers for typical adoption examples.
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 14:48:50 GMT):<br/>
Maybe one lens for considering groups like Social Impact is to consider what purpose Hyperledger as a whole solves - which is as an umbrella for open source blockchain projects.   The EEA is a standards body.    So the reason for any particular working group is to feed into that broader mission.

For the EEA that is exploring topics which will feed into the standards process (maybe exploring use-cases which drive the protocol layer, or which might lead to industry-specific standards higher up).

For Hyperledger, I think that means exploring use-cases which will lead to open source projects (or feed into existing open source projects).    So understanding the technical needs of various social impact projects would make sense to me.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 14:49:01 GMT):<br/>
i agree that techniques should keep close relationship with adoption cases.
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 14:51:03 GMT):<br/>
I agree, @baohua.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 14:54:10 GMT):<br/>
So wait, no vote on the social impact proposal?
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 14:54:40 GMT):<br/>
we can figure out this other question of where sector-specific WGs report in parallel, no?
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 14:55:01 GMT):<br/>
On the flip-side, then, your razor for when WGs should likely not be approved to move forward is when they don't really have potential to contribute to the greater mission of the organization.   In the EEA's case that would be discussion on topics which are realistically not going to inform the standards process and in Hyperledger's case that would be groups which are not realistically going to alter the direction of existing open source projects or lead to new projects.

There are many things which are "good", but may make better sense outside of Hyperledger.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 14:58:43 GMT):<br/>
I’m worried that the social impact WG will go down the road of human rights activism. It might get controversial and might take away from our technical mission.

That is for sure, @ry.   Various people have pointed out that there is likely a need for a Hippocratic Oath equivalent for computer scientists.   The chemists had their Dynamite moment, the physicists their Atomic Bomb.    There are serious consequences to our actions and to the societal impact of the systems which we create.

There is the Satoshi Oath, for example:
http://ipfs.b9lab.com:8080/ipfs/QmXysWEAexXQqYZhTGpECvksnaBkSEWHdGhM7vNeHxue2g/

But ethics are somewhat orthogonal to "Social Impact".   Such groups that I have seen in that area are more directly concerned with altruistic and public good applications of the technology than they are directly concerned with ethics per-se.
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 18:35:05 GMT):<br/>
If we are looking for a group of people concerned with ethical standards of the open source projects within Hyperledger (see Code of Conduct controversy in the Linux kernel community right now, for example) then that is one thing.

If we are looking at something which is orthogonal to industry verticals, but for the public sector, charity and similar use cases that is something different.

No value judgement from me in any of this.   Just trying to pull apart the threads and understand what we are really shooting to achieve.   What are the desired outputs?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 19:50:45 GMT):<br/>
IMO The social impact WG is a sector specific working group just like the healthcare WG or the public sector working group. They have special needs specific to the sector and there are many who are working on a bunch of solutions. So the TSC should approve the creation of such a group since they have already approved the creation of sector specific working groups. 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 19:51:54 GMT):<br/>
There is no need to read deeper into this, there are specific problems to be addressed in the social impact areas which may be best achieved using DLT for many reasons
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 19:56:30 GMT):<br/>
Decentralization, use of cryptographic methods to increase privacy, service delivery in remote regions - real solutions to real problems- this is not just a bunch of do-gooders and bleeding hearts without a realistic plan to solve some of these problems.  
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 19:56:53 GMT):<br/>
So please approve the WG- I support it
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 27 Sep 2018 23:03:54 GMT):<br/>
+1 to Vipin.  The social impact WG is not about social impact, per se (we're not anthropologists or sociologists, after all)--it's about the technical requirements and difficulties involved in utilizing Hyperledger blockchains in the general application area of social impact.  We're not going to necessarily be endorsing the position of any of the groups or people that may join--we just are giving them a place to discuss technical things related to their blockchain implementations (or goals around that).

it should be easier to go from EEA to HL... but it is going to be hard for HL to influence spec development unless we are members of both
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 14:51:29 GMT):<br/>
one indirect way is whether or not a HL project implements to an EEA spec.
A more direct way would be to provide feedback on a published spec.. obviously that's much better if the feedback comes before the spec is published.

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 14:55:45 GMT):<br/>
One area I would like to offer as a concrete thing to work on standardising: pluggable ethereum state interfaces - consisting of some kind of authenticated merkle tree - there is already diversity of implementations here like https://github.com/tendermint/iavl , a trie structure in Burrow, geth's https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/trie/trie.go etc... So a standard could allow vendors to provide some powerful optimisation under this (like DBs with the right native data structure). For me a concrete test case like this (as to whether there is willingness to unbundle spec) would be a good place to start collaborating.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 11 Oct 2018 14:56:53 GMT):<br/>
@baohua I agree with that idea also, but issue is that public eth community is relatively uninterested in a lot of permissioned network issues

permissioned, or permissioless, it's only meaningful for early-stage DLT. believe me, they will go to same goal :)

@hurf I know we spoke a looong time ago about getting burrow supported by caliper. I was just poking around the code and it seems very doable. We have a new SRE marmot who is a bit busy now with test net work but I think we could find time to add support in the next month. Who would be the best person to approach to work through this?

<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 18 Oct 2018 15:09:25 GMT):<br/>
Testnets are so, so important.

For anybody who didn't see, the Ethereum Constantinople hard fork went live on the Ropsten testnet a few days back and blew up, so the mainnet update is delayed.   Here is some analysis from Lane Rettig:

https://twitter.com/lrettig/status/1051933396065288192

Not blowing up would be better, of course, but the testnet did its job marvellously in this case, and we learnt a lot.   I think that the Hyperledger community could learn a lot from looking at the infrastructure and process which is put in place around the Ethereum public protocol.   This stuff is hard.  Really hard.

Do any of the Hyperledger projects have multiple implementations and specification/implementation split?   Maybe just Quilt?   That is another level of quality to shoot for.   If there is only a single implementation and there is not a contiguously maintained mainnet then it is a lot easier to have protocol bugs.

Anyway ...
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 18 Oct 2018 15:11:35 GMT):<br/>
Not that Ethereum has perfect processes.  Far from it.
But we are improving and learning all the time.
Mainly coming to understand just how hard it is not to make mistakes - even with the eyes of the world on you and proceeding with extreme caution and multiple levels of safeguards.
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 18 Oct 2018 15:16:55 GMT):<br/>
I understand that the EEA are launching a public testnet imminently.

Corda have a public testnet.

They now have https://docs.corda.r3.com/corda-firewall.html too, which is a pretty great attempt at solving a hard problem.
https://medium.com/corda/peer-to-peer-enterprise-blockchain-networking-with-the-corda-firewall-4f6a427ebd97

I think it would be hugely useful to have public testnets for Fabric, Sawtooth, Iroha, Burrow, Seth, Sabre, etc.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/tsc?msg=LSuPofaYEgwjkHaYK) @silasdavis FYI ... Chaals Nevile and Daniel Burnett from the EEA are going to be attending Ethereum Magicians in Prague on Oct 29, and will also be part of a session within DEVCON4 proper, along with me, Jamie Pitts, Nick Johnson, Boris Mann talking about how the EEA and public Ethereum protocol folks can work together.

I will bang their heads together until they all work together!

As you say, I think the climate is very different in 2018 to how it was in 2016, let alone in 2014.   The "dug in heels" are really not so dug in anymore, and the false perception that there is any real conflict between public and private scenarios is melting away.   I think that soon enough we will get to the modular specifications which we really need, so that all the enterprise folks and public folks can be sitting at the same tables talking about common issues.   How that gets deployed is pretty orthogonal to the technical discussions.

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 18 Oct 2018 16:28:18 GMT):<br/>
in hw costs I think we've spent ~$20k/month supporting the integration test networks for sawtooth 
That said, one of the main things with a testnet is we'd want multiple entities hosting. Shouldn't be all funded and hosted by HL.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 18 Oct 2018 16:46:13 GMT):<br/>
I have head-nod approval from @bbehlendorf to set up a couple nodes so we can have multiple test nets but LF doesn’t have the staff to manage them at all.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 18 Oct 2018 16:47:26 GMT):<br/>
anything beyond spawning them in AWS somewhere and adding some SSH keys is too much
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 01:12:15 GMT):<br/>
Well, as Dan says, the testnet should NOT be solely LF hosted.
Doing so would actually be counter-productive and not representative of a real mainnet.
To be really useful, a testnet should consist of nodes run by different companies.
And be paid for by the companies who see value in that.
And if nobody wants to pay then it isn't good enough value to be worth doing.
Of course, all HL members would love there to be magic testnets which just appear for free.
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Fri, 19 Oct 2018 01:12:48 GMT):<br/>
But you want to have the ability for members who see value to spin up a node and join in.

@bobsummerwill @dhuseby is working on budgeting for this. It wouldn't be LF hosted. My feeling is that we could make use of the CNCF infrastructure in the short term - it is available for uses like this via a pull request - and use k8s at AWS in the long term.

I don't think we are picky about the formal mechanics as long as we get effective expectations and reviews, that plan is articulated here in the proposal.  I don't think it is a problem for the TSC to view them all as "Maintainers" in the way proposed
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 25 Oct 2018 15:01:20 GMT):<br/>
ran out of time, but wanted to say: to a large degree the internal governance structure can be details the project works out, and can be informal.  The most important thing to avoid in anything that encourages segmentation is that it doesn't lead to fragmentation - that when a zero day is reported against a 13th subproject and the one guy who had been working on that isn't available, that the project as a whole realizes it has a collective responsibility to respond and fix et al.  So segmentation shouldn't be a way of avoiding responsibility.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/tsc?msg=CNdxirpv7bx8mPQ4s) @bbehlendorf Right.  I would agree that there is probably no degree for any formal definition on this score.   Maintainers always find their own balance.  There is always somebody who is better at DevOps, at testing, at documentation, at whatever.   This cryptographic specialism can probably just emerge during the code review process (ie. you should have have X, Y and Z look at that).
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 25 Oct 2018 15:04:24 GMT):<br/>
All I really wanted to do with this is make sure that code updates (at least ones that use cryptography in a non-black box way) are reviewed by people who have both 1) an extensive background in cryptography and the math behind it and 2) people who are very experienced in practical security matters (i.e. finding zero days, like Dave pointed out).  I think it's important that both of these groups have veto power over the code in the project.  If someone can suggest a better way to codify this rule in the governance, I'd love to hear it!

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/tsc?msg=fFZKu46TpHGDZR9BT) @hartm So perhaps that can be a simple as a section in your README with a list of "blessed" maintainers who are cryptographers / security folk, and say that 1 or N of these people need to be involved in every code review?   And the other maintainers just enforce that in their normal workflow.   The maintainers can add and remove people from that list.
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 25 Oct 2018 15:10:33 GMT):<br/>
Well - not every code review, even.
Just anything which affects API or the cryptography itself.
No doubt, like every project, many commits will be very minor and safe.
But this is where maintainers need to be very careful.

Another additional option would be to have periodic audits by those cryptographers / security people all all edits made that week / month / whatever.   And/or heavy audit of everything which has happened PRIOR to any releases.
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 25 Oct 2018 15:12:50 GMT):<br/>
Trying to lockstep every single commit might be too heavyweight and a real drag on productivity, especially if your timezone spread means that you are waiting on people in Europe to review changes made in North America or Asia, etc.   Ultimately you want to ensure that each release is good.   One way of doing that is to have a very high standard for each and every commit, in all dimensions.   Another is to have high standards, but not require full cryptography / security "extra pass" per commit, but to batch those.
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 25 Oct 2018 15:13:51 GMT):<br/>
On cpp-ethereum, we had a team split across Vancouver, Colorado and Berlin, and that stretch to Berlin was a huge pain for us in North America if we were waiting for review and then had this one-day latency on every little thing.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 25 Oct 2018 15:14:59 GMT):<br/>
@bobsummerwill I wanted the "steward" responsibilities to essentially be "make sure that everything is secure from an algorithmic standpoint."  This would generally involve doing most of the things you mention.  
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 25 Oct 2018 15:15:39 GMT):<br/>
No one had any intention of requiring every commit to be signed off by a cryptographer--many commits are going to not directly involve cryptographic algorithms, and these certainly don't need heavy oversight.
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 25 Oct 2018 15:20:36 GMT):<br/>

@cbf I received the new invite, are you sure you don't have it in your mailbox?

The new zoom is on the wiki as well.

@hartm the most important part is the stickers

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 14:39:04 GMT):<br/>
+1 to the stickers!
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 14:39:33 GMT):<br/>
Haha, our planned maintainer list really likes Ursa, and they want a "scary bear in the dark" logo.  I think that would make pretty good stickers!
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 14:39:34 GMT):<br/>
of course the stickers must be encrypted
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 14:40:24 GMT):<br/>
Must be signed with EdDSA!

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 14:41:31 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 01 Nov 2018 14:43:26 GMT):<br/>
maybe we should resurrect planetlab

it sounds like there are a somewhat diverse set of wants - but it also sounds like there might be fixed core requirement we could come up with. Something like a multi-master kubernetes cluster with a small pool of workers/physical volumes spread across at least availability zones and maybe clouds. Some utility metrics stuff like promethesus/kibana, elastic stack for logs, a local docker registry for pre-release builds, and namespaces used to separate out resources. That would be enough to experiment with small testnets. If there are going to be more formal benchmarking, long-running fuzz tests, or bug reproductions from the field then they could all be prototyped on the entry level network. Spinning up a new namespace for a formal benchmark with bigger hardware, or integrating long running tests into CI could happen after that.

Hello everyone, I'm looking for return of exeperiences on agile projects organization on hyperledger subject. That is to say : how do you choose the Product Owner of the project when you have several stakeholder involved? I mean on a project where you have around the table stakeholders that have clients/suppliers relationship and that are conducting a blockchain initiative together? Thank you

@Marine this could be beyond the scope of just the tsc or blockchain projects in general. What do people do when a projects touch upon multiple lines of business in a normal agile project. If the project is sufficiently small then it is easier; however for a project that touches upon a whole vertical technical stack and potentially affects multiple lines of business and affects multiple enterprises. It has to be through the formation of some committees and nomination of people to represent product owner/scrum master etc. Who would then take part in daily scrums. Then periodic status reports and actual working software to be distributed to the committees/actual business owners, mediated through the product owner/scrum master- the developers and the work itself being timeboxed in sprints.

Draw parallels to Indy, whose Wallets/Agents/VON etc. may seem to be in the "application" space

<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 15:47:09 GMT):<br/>
sounds like a horn that a clown would use...
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 15:47:33 GMT):<br/>
no lack of clowns here :)
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 15:51:39 GMT):<br/>
But are we sad clowns, funny clowns, or scary clowns?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 15:52:14 GMT):<br/>
all clowns are scary and sad
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 15:57:21 GMT):<br/>
@hartm  you have control over exactly like type of clown you want to be! 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 15:58:50 GMT):<br/>
that was well put Mic
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 15:59:12 GMT):<br/>
+1
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 15:59:18 GMT):<br/>
sorry if I threw in a bunch of different issues into the discussion :)
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 15:59:20 GMT):<br/>
so if i raise my hand and lower it and raise it and lower it and raise it... then does it look like i'm waving?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 15:59:25 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, I agree with Mic.  I'd love to see more specificity in the proposal document.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 15:59:54 GMT):<br/>
I do think that we should become more conservative about our expectations regarding the cross platform aspect
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 15:59:55 GMT):<br/>
(Something in between the rfcs and what is currently in the document).
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:00:21 GMT):<br/>
evidence shows that we've been overly optimistic and I don't think he does anybody any good
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:00:51 GMT):<br/>
Composer would have been better off a Fabric project
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:00:51 GMT):<br/>
Composer would have been better off a Fabric project for instance
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:02:01 GMT):<br/>
I think if a project proposal does not aim to cross platform it should be a subproject of the existing project
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:02:36 GMT):<br/>
if something starts within the context of a particular platform and it becomes useful to other projects we can always promote it then
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:02:51 GMT):<br/>
By that token, explorer, composer, etc. should be sub projects of Fabric
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:02:54 GMT):<br/>
I think that's a better approach than the other way around - which is what we've been doing
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:02:57 GMT):<br/>
~~~ End of verbal discussion ~~~~
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:03:06 GMT):<br/>
My point is that the charter has already been violated
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:03:39 GMT):<br/>
And it is the signs of maturity that leads us further up the stack
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:04:02 GMT):<br/>
and btw Vipin, I think Caliper is cross platform because the very people who wanted to develop Caliper were themselves interested in supporting several platforms
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:04:24 GMT):<br/>
@lehors likewise with the crypto lib
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:04:31 GMT):<br/>
which was my point: unless we have committed resources to supporting several platforms we can't expect it to happen
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:04:40 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:04:46 GMT):<br/>
I was distinctly under the impression that Fabric had interest in wasm.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:05:19 GMT):<br/>
as I said Dan, this is by no means sufficient
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:05:36 GMT):<br/>
I would hate that fabric would want to block a project that might not support it after so many that came before this one.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:05:47 GMT):<br/>
Maybe it will help to drill down from the supply chain totality into the individual sub projects  and into where they could be used, either on a use case level or where there could be challenges or uses on a multi-platform level
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:05:49 GMT):<br/>
it's not like you can throw any go code to the fabric chaincode container and hope for it to work, right?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:06:00 GMT):<br/>
it still needs to use the right API
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:06:11 GMT):<br/>
this "cross-platform by fiat" rather than "cross-platform by contribution" argument seems contrary to IBM's behavior to date with respect to project proposals
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:06:48 GMT):<br/>
Caliper by nature has to support multiple projects since it is about measurement to compare, and Haowei committed resources
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:06:58 GMT):<br/>
I think the message there is basically "if it doesn't support Fabric, it shouldn't be a top-level project"
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:07:09 GMT):<br/>
+1 Amundsen
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:07:24 GMT):<br/>
no, I would say the same of Composer today
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:07:38 GMT):<br/>
so, you're misinterpreting my position
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:07:44 GMT):<br/>
What about Cello, Explorer and others
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:07:58 GMT):<br/>
just because we've done it wrong in the past doesn't mean we should keep doing it wrong
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:08:06 GMT):<br/>
the principle to date seems to have been "these are open projects, and if you want to see support, show up with development resources"
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:08:10 GMT):<br/>
it's an awfully convenient time to take that position
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:08:12 GMT):<br/>
I feel the same Vipin
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:08:15 GMT):<br/>
how convenient for IBM?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:08:20 GMT):<br/>
pfff
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:08:30 GMT):<br/>
There is no wrong and right here, there are evolving interpretations
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:08:34 GMT):<br/>
that's very disappointing to get that kind of argument
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:08:54 GMT):<br/>
I would have hoped to be seen as less partisan but oh well
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:08:58 GMT):<br/>
lots of things about this are disappointing
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:09:05 GMT):<br/>
it's disappointing that we were not discussing the merits of the project, and instead whether it supports Fabric
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:09:23 GMT):<br/>
and also the elephant in the room which is the protectionism of commercial interests in the app space
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:09:35 GMT):<br/>
rather than a commitment to open source
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:09:40 GMT):<br/>
wow this is really gone off of the tracks
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:10:13 GMT):<br/>
to be clear, I very much want Fabric+Sabre integration, and am strongly advocating for it to happen, which is what gives this project Fabric integration. but that's not the point, is it?
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:10:25 GMT):<br/>
i don't think it's off the tracks -- it's the heart of the issue we have been dancing around
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:10:25 GMT):<br/>
lets all take a step away from the keyboard and regain our professional composer
</p>

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:11:43 GMT):<br/>
If this project is able to produce artefacts that target the WASM ecosystem I would find that sufficiently unbiased an output to support cross-project work. In Burrow's case we would like to integrate a WASM interpretter callable from solidity - this project could provide additional impetus for doing so
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:11:47 GMT):<br/>
why wouldn't interested fabric developers sign up to improve Hyperledger Supply Chain?
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:12:16 GMT):<br/>
I have no favorite in this fight, the proposal appears to be very sawtooth centric to me and I was going to ask if it was going to cross platform
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:13:56 GMT):<br/>
Look it is very simple: the supplychain project will address a vast swathe of use cases, with it many elements of data representation, function representation etc. If done right and designed properly, this will contribute to the interoperability tooling, also maye provide feedstock to multiple other use caes; it is time to support this effort.

(BTW if Burrow did support WASM it would probably be via golang's https://github.com/go-interpreter/wagon - such a harness would run as chaincode - possibly even under the existing fabric-EVM integration if we built it like that)

@mwagner then intent is to be behind the wasm interface. that's  kind of like how solidity contracts are deployable over any evm.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:17:53 GMT):<br/>
the intent behind using Sabre is compatibility within the project, not as a mechanism for supporting all the frameworks. it has the attribute that we think it will make that fairly easy.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:18:17 GMT):<br/>
Some of them include: Provenance tracking (IOT, Oracles for DO), Trade finance (payments, commitments, cash or tokens on ledger), Factoring(Privacy on ledger), demand forecasting etc.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:19:16 GMT):<br/>
@hartm could you clarify your specificity request. Are the RFCs too specific? Is there an example in a prior proposal that serves as a good example of the level of specificity you are seeking? 
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:19:34 GMT):<br/>
I am in favor of working to make sure that things can be shared across the different platforms. If this helps get us there then lets do it.  
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:19:35 GMT):<br/>
Higher level outputs may also be possible, I reference WebIDL having read this: https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/issues/42
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:19:40 GMT):<br/>
I think it's also important to recognize that Sawtooth and Fabric are not at feature parity (despite being close), and the problems we use Sawtooth to solve, Fabric may not have the right feature set for; or we may have to wait for it to catch up.
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:20:56 GMT):<br/>
sounds like great opportunities for motivated developers to make improvements across the board
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:21:03 GMT):<br/>
The long term though, is that fabric may provide a deployment model which is better suited to a certain consortia. If supply chain can deploy over a variety of platforms then those decisions are decoupled.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:21:29 GMT):<br/>
you can choose which domain you are developing for and then which blockchain platform you are deploying for.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:22:10 GMT):<br/>
This project helps reach that future.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:24:12 GMT):<br/>
again, I want to drive toward Fabric support for Sabre, I'm very passionate about that, but that's different (lower-level) than mandating a higher-level platform support all frameworks.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:33:59 GMT):<br/>
@Dan For instance, this is a supply chain proposal.  Why would this framework not work for, say, finance, fintech, or trading applications?  If it would work for these, why is it supply-chain focused?  I think clarifying some of these issues will make people much more comfortable with the proposal.  Again, it's possible to go through the RFCs and draw your own conclusions, but that takes a decent amount of time.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:34:47 GMT):<br/>
hmmm the rfcs and the gs1 spec are the things that make it specific. 
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:35:31 GMT):<br/>
Do you want me to summarize the RFCs and GS1 spec?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:35:54 GMT):<br/>
@hartm supply chain has a larger superset of user functions than the ones you mention 
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:36:52 GMT):<br/>
That would probably be really helpful.  The TSC would have been pretty upset with me if I just linked to eprint papers in the crypto-lib proposal and suggested that they read them ;)  A little guidance would probably go a long way.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:38:15 GMT):<br/>
supply chain has the most use cases currently being worked on. According to an informal analysis that I did, it outranks every other use case by a large factor, so if you had to choose one, supply chain would be it. 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:38:54 GMT):<br/>
to get the maximum bang for the buck
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:39:32 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB I agree.  But there is nothing right now *in the proposal itself* that seems to be specific only to supply chain (the RFCs tell a different story).  I'm just asking for clarification about this in the document.
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:42:18 GMT):<br/>
we are working on supply chain use cases - we are willing to contribute back components from those initiatives to the OSS community. if someone else is working on a finance use case and wants to contribute finance components, then maybe the TSC can get together and decide how to manage those various libraries of reusable components? (one project, multiple projects, subprojects, whatever...)
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:45:15 GMT):<br/>
@cecchi I understand that, and I'm really happy you all want to contribute back to the OSS community.  I'm not knocking the project itself--just the proposal document!  I think I understand what you all are trying to do, but it would be nice if the proposal clarified this.
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:52:18 GMT):<br/>
feels like the project itself gets knocked (gotta make sure it's not an app), then the impl gets knocked (gotta be fully interoperable), then the proposal gets knocked (not specific enough to supply chains). bit of a goose chase here. i mean we don't know every possible "noun" that we'll run into as part of our work, and it seems weird to expect that level of specificity in a proposal. Nor do i think "GS1" is the *only* spec that will ever get implemented.
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:53:30 GMT):<br/>
so we're gonna build some nouns that other people can use, we'll build them in ways that run in Sabre and hopefully there are other hyperledger level conversations going on to align on WASM, we'll build some other stuff that would help people build apps more efficiently and effectively, etc
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:53:55 GMT):<br/>
i feel like RFC within the project could manage governance of noun submission if that's really a sticking point
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 16:55:05 GMT):<br/>
and candidly these calls don't "feel" like this group is happy we are willing to contribute back 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Nov 2018 17:02:59 GMT):<br/>
@cecchi there is great level of support in the community; it is often the dissenting or the skeptical voices that are the loudest. I can collaborate on the document itself (at least in the beginning).

@cecchi @Dan @amundson @jsmitchell  it is because you are pushing the boundaries that there is such a brouhaha. So it is a good thing. Willing to share some findings and previous work that I had done in the space. We used the supply chain to develop the Privacy & Confidentiality (offshoot of Architectural Working Group) argument. Here is the writeup for that: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-WVtWEh5HKX9Lmbl7PMl5axHrd2uXwIPVZkeGfsHY3E/edit?usp=sharing. The interesting features are in the description of the various documents etc. that are standardized, some of that may rely on the GS1 stuff that you mention, I can dig up some more standards on those documents. This may of course cause people to say that you are skating too close to an application. However, it may be interesting to create a narrative about re-usable primitives and show how it can be used (for example) in a Bill of Materials in Manufacturing or show how the components of the Bill of Lading plus some other items can be mapped to some other applications. I believe @MicBowman had already shared this document with you when you started the provenance app. Even if the bid to be an incubated project fails; I urge you to bring this to Hyperledger labs, where the community can collaborate. After extracting many of the useful primitives and demonstrating their use or mappability to other projects we can then ask for this project to be incubated. My support (for what it is worth) is behind this project. Also similar efforts are afoot in some other areas, please look at the Common Data Model (CDM) created by ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association)- although their primitives apply to a totally different product (swaps and derivatives); I can see a parallel, especially in the payments side of things.

</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 23:12:05 GMT):<br/>
If TSC gavels down the idea of a top level supply chain project on the grounds that it's not "appropriate" in some way, feels like putting it in Labs is just a dead end, right? I'm maybe missing something, tho. Like there'd be no promotion path... Either way, if HL rejects it, I'm guessing we'd be wise to explore other communities before re-proposing via 2nd class citizen status in HL.  
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 23:13:47 GMT):<br/>
and for sure there are plenty of consortium / standards driven data models, any/all of which could be impl'd and submitted as 'frameworks' or 'includes' or what have you. Open Data Initiative just launched, for example. Someone could impl that and contribute. they could build that model using true primatives (string/bool/int) as defined by HL SC.  
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 23:19:06 GMT):<br/>
looking forward to the continued conversation - really believe HL is the right place for this
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 13:11:29 GMT):<br/>
@cecchi cryptolib came out of labs into full incubation (as Ursa). So there is a promotion path. There is no need to think of labs as a second class venue, it is a different kind of venue where exploration can be done more freely.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 16:30:08 GMT):<br/>
I think the concern here is that if there are reasons that prevent promoting the code to project in incubation status today, what is the reason to believe those circumstances will change?  My feedback here is most of the hesitation is the uncertainty about how the project will be cross-framework compatible if it is to be governed as a tool, and conversely how it will be "application agnostic" if it is going to be governed more like a SIG/Industry-specific interest group.  Because it is a little bit of both, the TSC isn't sure which concerns dominate its governance, and that has caused some hesitation.   For my part, I think getting going in a lab will help us get a feel for how much interest and support there is for the Tools vs SIG side of the project, and help us make whatever room is best for the useful things the community is interested in supporting.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 16:40:28 GMT):<br/>
This is definitely not a SIG. It is explicitly a coding project. We should have governance questions clarified in the coming weeks. I think it will be best to revisit the proposal at that time.
@VipinB as I look at the doc you sent I think one of the first links (SCM) might be busted (or maybe my connection is just flakey).
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 16:41:09 GMT):<br/>
Also curious was this produced with the assistance of the old reqt's group? or was it wholely through the privates WG? 
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 16:53:25 GMT):<br/>
@Dan I agree that it isn't a SIG, but the charter does state it is pursuing Supply Chain concerns, which feels "SIG-like".  Whether that sub-domain can exist as a tool without stepping on application consortiums and application-specific concerns is one of the lines of questioning where some seem uncomfortable.  (I believe it is against our best interest to decline project status to a group of motivated, active contributors on those grounds, but I am also newer to the concerns at Hyperledger that motivate us to avoid "application specific" projects, so I defer to TSC members who raised those concerns).
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 16:54:50 GMT):<br/>
Understood. I'm hoping we will have clarity on that in a few weeks.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 16:55:16 GMT):<br/>
@Dan it was written wholly by me, with some reviews by others. As far as I am concerned with supply chain, I was on a PoC as well as governance of Marco Polo Project and early involvement in Voltron (first trade was announced this week)
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 16:56:20 GMT):<br/>
Since I am not with BNPP anymore, I am not involved in those projects
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 16:57:57 GMT):<br/>
Ok, Voltron is a cool project name. 
</p>

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 16:59:33 GMT):<br/>
And the paper I wrote was contributed to the privacy working group as an example to look at the privacy concerns from a use case perspective. Here is a case where the supply chain informed a generic problem..i.e. privacy & confidentiality
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 17:04:52 GMT):<br/>
This is why the Supplychain project is a great vehicle for generic problem solving
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 17:05:38 GMT):<br/>

Actually, I think you've already initiated a good topic on the mail list. When the desktop project does come in for discussion, I would like those contributors not to have to sit through a dialog on what we want HL to look like, but instead hear review of their specific proposal. If everyone could please take some time to think about what HL looks like 2 years from now with more and bigger projects, where the lines of what a ledger and an app have evolved from our current assumptions... i think that will help us move more thoughtfully and efficiently towards better guidance. 
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 15 Nov 2018 15:17:55 GMT):<br/>
Maybe consider poking around inside a project you haven't looked in before. Broaden / deepen your understanding of the elements we do have.

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 04:07:29 GMT):<br/>
As a non-TSC member, I don't feel the TSC has much to say about top level projects (Fabric, Sawtooth) gaining sub-projects. Sawtooth has certainly spawned a ton of what I would call sub-projects without any say-so or reportage to the TSC. Provided the license is correct and the DCO is in shape, what purview is it of the TSCs if Fabric wants to have a desktop client?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 14:22:44 GMT):<br/>
But what if Fabric doesn't want to have a desktop client? I'm hoping to see some response on the mail list whether this specific desktop proposal is desired by Fabric maintainers. I don't have the proposal in front of me but I think the contributors are not fabric maintainers?

iirc we modeled a bit off the asf labs. They required maintainer or contributor status to open a lab. We didn't have whatever that mechanism was and decided to use sponsors as a close facsimile. I bet a search of the mail list might pop that up. Maybe.

How about moving the supplychain discussion to the end, as this may not be resolved today (unless the board has some very definite directions to us)?

"parts and pieces"
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 15:29:49 GMT):<br/>
This was my take: The output of HL Grid(the supplychain project) is meant to be (according to my understanding)
1. A Reference implementation- generalized through WASM
2. Reference Implementation contains a library of shared code and domain models complaint with GS1 which can be reused in other use case implementations (not just supply chain)
3. A launchpad to port this to other DLTs (Fabric, Burrow, Iroha, Quilt?) and using Indy: Helped by WASM integration as well as shared code for GS1 (industry spec)     
and as I have stated before, this is the right time to embark on such a project in terms of platform maturity. Users want an easier path toward adoption
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 15:31:57 GMT):<br/>
We discussed using this through PSWG for driving a use case based metric framework 
</p>
<p><strong>cecchi</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 15:32:07 GMT):<br/>
i wouldn't constrain to GS1, that's just an example - the Gridlibs could include all sorts of impl for various specs/standards.  At the end of the proposal we list a bunch of potential things.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 15:34:54 GMT):<br/>
Yeah that's what I was driving 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 15:34:54 GMT):<br/>
Yeah that's what I was driving at - it sounds like we could provide some reserved WASM function addresses for a get/set over byte slices
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 15:34:54 GMT):<br/>
Yeah that's what I was driving at - it sounds like we could provide some reserved WASM function addresses for a get/set over byte slices against a WASM interpreter
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 15:35:39 GMT):<br/>
the focus on WASM artifacts would define the "interoperability layer"?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 06 Dec 2018 15:36:33 GMT):<br/>
Sure in terms of standards if we could support some of the existing standards for Hague-Visby or UPC600

probably a gap here 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 15:31:11 GMT):<br/>
I think it's really a matter of setting expectations right
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 15:32:10 GMT):<br/>
if we announce a meeting for contributors and state that this is meant to be about deep technical discussions and is NOT intended for newbies that ought to filter out attendees, just via self selection
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 15:32:31 GMT):<br/>
coding at the event is not necessarily the point - getting alignment from everyone to work together and gain an understanding of the diverse approaches is far more important. but, I'm concerned with the idea of having very strutured conversation trying to design/architect something an limiting developer discussion.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 15:32:35 GMT):<br/>
At one end, I imagine something like "for one solid week, three times a year, the core committers get together to advance interop"
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 15:33:54 GMT):<br/>
I agree coding isn't necessarily the goal
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 15:34:12 GMT):<br/>
what we really want to avoid is the general info sessions for newbies
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 15:34:55 GMT):<br/>
so we can focus on technical discussions
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 15:36:09 GMT):<br/>

I think that would be good -- to limit newbie/getting-started discussion, but there is also benefit in meeting the community, and it sounds like the current goal is to squash the non-contributor part of that or shift to the bootcamps (which I admit don't make complete sense yet to me).

@tkuhrt  I just sent a link to them about the process for submitting a WG proposal
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 14:06:50 GMT):<br/>
@mwagner had given feedback on ID WG paper and couple of others from IDWG. Mr Wagner's input included the suggestion that for community building we can have widespread adoption of the welcome volunteer concept. Apologies for omitting this in my report and conclusions of yesterday.

<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 18:47:18 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 18:47:41 GMT):<br/>
So @VipinB if you want to attach a note, please do so.

<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 18:48:00 GMT):<br/>
Also i'm know my note taking isn't perfect - so people can add additional points too!

<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 18:48:50 GMT):<br/>
to add comments - don't click edit!  just highlight and a comment button will hover and you can easily add an inline comment!

@kelly_ ?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 15:14:18 GMT):<br/>

in terms of just going to issues

<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:22:27 GMT):<br/>
geo specific channels seem interesting, but it's really hard to overstate how central WeChat usage is to teams in China.
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:26:22 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:26:28 GMT):<br/>
Not from Cello, and can’t speak, as in a communal space, but we are working on a library for deploying HLF to K8S: https://nephos.readthedocs.io
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:27:15 GMT):<br/>
100% test coverage and documentation and several working examples, still working on some features. Perhaps Cello can use this as backend, if some of it is useful?
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:27:22 GMT):<br/>
@bbehlendorf agreed, was thinking maybe a rocketchat/wechat bridge if wechat is already split into project specific channels
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:27:28 GMT):<br/>
if not, may not be particularly useful
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:28:29 GMT):<br/>
we did explore this in the past, and it looked like the API to wechat involved using a rooted android phone. This was a year ago or so, perhaps it is better now
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:28:44 GMT):<br/>
https://rocket.chat/docs/administrator-guides/google-cloud/auto-translate/ about $20/1 million characters
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:28:54 GMT):<br/>
Not clear if this is per user
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:29:40 GMT):<br/>
Can only be done by administrators
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:31:44 GMT):<br/>
@alexvicegrab is it aligned with this? https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2018/11/08/deploying-hyperledger-fabric-on-kubernetes
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:31:56 GMT):<br/>
@kelly_ I'm on the call!
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:32:05 GMT):<br/>
Just forgot to rename the enterprise zoom account...
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:32:46 GMT):<br/>
@bbehlendorf, yes, I'm the author of that
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:33:21 GMT):<br/>
Also did this workshop at HGF: https://hgf18.sched.com/event/b76c86de07c3bcaa094a8b149470e0e7
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:33:52 GMT):<br/>
yay!
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:34:17 GMT):<br/>
we should have given you full credit on that blog, not sure why we didn't
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:35:03 GMT):<br/>
No hard feelings :) Eventually we'd like to move Nephos to become a Hyperledger project, but wanted it to have some basic documentation and solid testing in place.
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:35:26 GMT):<br/>
You mentioned at DevCon that we should start with Hyperledger Labs
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:39:16 GMT):<br/>
Labs is a good starting ground, yes
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:39:17 GMT):<br/>
@bbehlendorf same issue w/credit has happened a few times, like the first grid post. (usually though the blogs have been going pretty smoothly)
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:39:29 GMT):<br/>
+1 on the change
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:45:54 GMT):<br/>
GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket? Don't mean to be rude, but Gerrit is very unwieldy and hard to use (having done several successful contributions to several different repos).
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:48:05 GMT):<br/>
I like the full realtime firehose of confluence commits though!  Shows aliveness.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:48:18 GMT):<br/>
Gerrit has other benefits
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:48:36 GMT):<br/>
DCO enforcement for one
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:50:18 GMT):<br/>
@rjones The helm project enforces DCO on GitHub: https://github.com/helm/charts/pull/11616 (Helm also being linked to Linux Foundation)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:50:41 GMT):<br/>
The GitHub DCO enforcement is not very good.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:52:31 GMT):<br/>
https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/tools/Community+Health+Committee https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/tools/Meeting+notes
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:53:22 GMT):<br/>
@rjones How so? Perhaps you can elaborate what are the issues with the GitHub DCO enforcement?
Gerrit on the other hand makes it much more difficult to contribute. I have dozens of contributions on Helm, most quickly tested with CI/CD, reviewed, etc. When I look at working with Gerrit I am very reluctant to use it, given poor documentation, unwieldy GUI and difficult to use CLI tools. IMHO.
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:54:30 GMT):<br/>
Again, I don't mind whether we use GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or anything else, but Gerrit is horrendous and turns contributions away.
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:55:19 GMT):<br/>
Apologies for my brutality, but I feel quite strongly about it, and am probably not the only one. Would be good to do a poll on this.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:56:44 GMT):<br/>
*TSC MEETING END 21 FEB 2019*
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 15:58:56 GMT):<br/>
I don't think you're being "brutal". The projects using Gerrit are all Fabric based. If you want to move them to GitHub, agitate with those maintainers to do so.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 16:00:25 GMT):<br/>
for what it's worth, I like Gerrit better than Github - there is always going to be someone with a different opinion ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 16:00:55 GMT):<br/>
@alexvicegrab all the hyperledger sawtooth stuff is on github
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 16:01:12 GMT):<br/>
there is no mandate to use gerrit
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 16:01:15 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @rjones, you are right, I should and will encourage the maintainers to do this.
@lehors, fair enough. Hence the poll :D
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 16:01:28 GMT):<br/>
github isn't all rainbows and uniorns
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 16:01:52 GMT):<br/>
my biggest gripe is that we can't use github issues because they don't support confidential bug reporting and handling
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 16:02:41 GMT):<br/>
Composer was also on GitHub, but we are currently working on Fabric, its CA, etc. I'm not a GitHub fanboy by any means, and would be happy to use other SVC hosting solutions (again, GitLab, BitBucket, etc.)
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 16:02:42 GMT):<br/>
so if you move to github, you have to turn off issues
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 16:03:10 GMT):<br/>
I only like github because that's where the largest crowd of potential contributors is
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 16:04:29 GMT):<br/>
if you made me the dictator, I'd have us all using just git and git format-patch and git send-patch with an old school email list.  Like how the Git project and Linux kernel projects collaborate. I'd also make you all use Mutt and Vim.
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 16:04:32 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/tsc?msg=Wb985RxJPkSXFeZWD) Regarding confidential bug reporting, this is mainly critical for security bugs, and we may continue using JIRA for issue tracking/reporting, if that supports private bug reports.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 16:04:37 GMT):<br/>
This is why I'm not the dictator.
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 16:05:15 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/tsc?msg=zrZ7HdBmc49RXdDGW) I like vim, and the git command line, so I'm 50% there :)
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 16:05:29 GMT):<br/>
@alexvicegrab the Hyperledger JIRA has been customized to support security bugs and our confidential bug handling process
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 16:06:09 GMT):<br/>
when you submit a bug on jira.hyperledger.org, you'll see a field labeled "security issue".  If you set that to "is a security issue", the bug will be handled confidentially by the volunteer security team
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 16:06:50 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I don't mind using JIRA, only Gerrit.
</p>
<p><strong>alexvicegrab</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 16:07:18 GMT):<br/>
JIRA is fairly easy to navigate/filter, etc. if not perfect.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 16:23:59 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/tsc?msg=YwhhMJff2S3GKbrNP) @dhuseby when I spoke to GH devs yesterday, I noted that as a limitation that we needed for doing responsible disclosure
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 17:01:52 GMT):<br/>
@cbf I have had multiple discussions with GH's technical product manager about the same thing. He assures me it is in their feature road map but just not a very high priority.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 17:02:34 GMT):<br/>
@cbf you should already be getting security alerts for fabric from github
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 17:02:56 GMT):<br/>
hmmm
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 17:03:24 GMT):<br/>
and for the record, now that we have confluence, I am much more in favor of using JIRA for everything and making sure that all of our projects turn off github issues
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 17:03:37 GMT):<br/>
the JIRA+Confluence integrations we have already are really nice
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 17:04:03 GMT):<br/>
and hopefully we can get all of the other whizbang cool stuff that we saw last year in the Praecipio demo
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 17:04:42 GMT):<br/>
@cbf expect an email from me on that ^^^ today. I have a few more things I'd like to pick your brain about too
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 17:23:13 GMT):<br/>
@dhuseby too bad there aren't open source tools for wikis and issue management. with this dictator proposal, do we send these patches to you? :) 
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 22 Feb 2019 01:56:20 GMT):<br/>
@amundson go ahead and send me a patch that makes me dictator. ; )
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 22 Feb 2019 01:56:44 GMT):<br/>
I have worked in both the kernel and git communities many times in the past. I just love the simplicity
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 22 Feb 2019 01:56:56 GMT):<br/>
I love how they divide up ownership along module lines
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 22 Feb 2019 01:57:01 GMT):<br/>
they delegate in a tree structure
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 22 Feb 2019 01:57:38 GMT):<br/>
you change the virtual fs layer in the kernel, the patch gets sent to the kernel mailing list and cc'd to the maintainer in charge of that part of the code
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 22 Feb 2019 01:58:05 GMT):<br/>
patches accumulate and flow up the maintainer tree until Linux decides it's time to land them all and tag a new release
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 22 Feb 2019 01:58:30 GMT):<br/>
I love using guilt (quilt for git) to manage trees of patches
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 22 Feb 2019 01:58:50 GMT):<br/>
If I could go my whole day without touching a mouse, I would.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 22 Feb 2019 01:59:44 GMT):<br/>
if you want to see how we should be doing mailing lists, do yourself a favor and ssh sdf.org, set up a free account, and when it drops you to the shell, type "bboard"
</p>

</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Wed, 27 Feb 2019 22:24:58 GMT):<br/>

I recall that there were a CLA hub used previously. If we can consider this a valid tool for DCO then the project has no problem with it, I guess

The Apache 2.0 LICENSE file came in commit #20 in Sep 25, 2016 and MizukiSonoko (aka SonokoMizuki) and takemiyamakoto are the only committers prior to this change.  Provided that employment and contractor relationships are all in order I don't expect there is a practical problem, we just need to be sure.

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 15:13:22 GMT):<br/>
@alexvicegrab the TSC has delegated that to lab stewards
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 15:14:34 GMT):<br/>
@nage awesome! Thanks. Can we double-check that with the legal team? we need to make sure that we comply with https://www.hyperledger.org/about/charter
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 15:18:09 GMT):<br/>
It is specifically said that  All contributions shall be accompanied by a Developer Certificate of Origin sign-off (http://developercertificate.org) that is submitted through a Governing Board and LF-approved contribution process
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 15:18:23 GMT):<br/>
Now we need to clarify what is a "Governing Board and LF-approved contribution process". Is this a -s option? Was there any decision made and documented?

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 17:15:57 GMT):<br/>
@neewy some time ago you and I discussed a squash commit. I think that is something to consider.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 18:41:42 GMT):<br/>
Even disregarding commits with several signed-off-by lines, there is a big gap:
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 18:41:45 GMT):<br/>
```mbp:iroha ry$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
mbp:iroha ry$ git log|grep ^Author: |wc -l
    6665
mbp:iroha ry$ git log|grep ^commit |wc -l
    6665
mbp:iroha ry$ git log|grep "Signed-off-by" |wc -l
    3002
```
</p>
<p><strong>neewy</strong> (Fri, 15 Mar 2019 07:46:42 GMT):<br/>
We have time to fix the commits I guess :) It is really important to have valid git blame

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:22:53 GMT):<br/>
So what happens if a project tells all of its contributors to make each commit using a fresh, pseudonymous LF account.  Would this help them meet the diversity metric? ;)

Composer itself shows their are many kinds of diversity.  Chat is super supportive of the community even today.  It is also our biggest draw on social media.

i asked Iroha to show all the types of diversity for a full community that goes beyond just core maintainers.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:33:37 GMT):<br/>
Reading @dhuseby 's mail on this I think I agree. Allowing 1.0.0 progression and possibly taking back to 'community incubation'
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:33:54 GMT):<br/>
this is a VERY common topic in D&I  in a true meritocracy - we need to acknowledge all the volunteers. 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:34:26 GMT):<br/>

Diversity is even very different in various cultures.
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:36:44 GMT):<br/>
Breaking out metrics maybe the solution here.  technical vs vendor Diversity.  and community health because the other numbers on community health - we are just now figuring out how to measure.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:37:27 GMT):<br/>
I don't really think people outside Hyperledger notice active vs incubation status very much, and it's not clear what changes even within Hyperledger when you go from incubation to active (maybe some marketing benefits, but that's about it).  
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:37:58 GMT):<br/>
I worry we are spending a lot of time discussing something that is essentially meaningless.
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:38:10 GMT):<br/>
similar feeling...
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:40:00 GMT):<br/>
I agree with Mic here, the code looks good, but I think we need closure on the DCO issue
</p>
<p><strong>takemiyamakoto</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:40:44 GMT):<br/>
<i>Has joined the channel.</i>
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:40:46 GMT):<br/>
Agreed. Feel like incubation _ought_ to mean something though 
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:40:49 GMT):<br/>
I am inclined to separate technical criteria from diversity metrics.  If we want to emphasize diversity/contributors, we can just emphasize this on the project page.  When people are looking at a project to use/work on/join/contribute to, they can see these metrics for themselves and make an informed decision on the future of hte project.
</p>
<p><strong>takemiyamakoto</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:41:10 GMT):<br/>
Blockchain hype cycle also has a big impact on community health too. 2017 was a much easier time to get a lot of people excited about contributing
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:41:27 GMT):<br/>
@silasdavis We are discussing incubation vs active status.  I'm struggling to find a practical separation.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:41:52 GMT):<br/>
what we will be voting on is essentially should Hyperledger /Linux Foundation fund marketing in support of a major release. 
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:42:17 GMT):<br/>
Does that release reflect the HL goals.
</p>
<p><strong>takemiyamakoto</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:42:20 GMT):<br/>
Iroha codebase prior to HL were all done by Soramitsu employees. Once we entered HL, all commits used CLAhub until CLAhub was no longer used and each commit was signed
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:42:49 GMT):<br/>
We have already spent the "big money" on a security and scanning audits to check their technical readiness
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:43:23 GMT):<br/>
@Dan Doesn't this sound fundamentally like a marketing/governing board issue, then?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:43:48 GMT):<br/>
They will want to know from us, does this project reflect HL culture/quality.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:44:12 GMT):<br/>
True.
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:44:36 GMT):<br/>
I am working with the Marketing Committee to create that vocabulary and will be running all drafts by the TSC. 
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:44:39 GMT):<br/>
But this, then, becomes a technical assessment?
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:44:54 GMT):<br/>
hyperledger is exceptional in *many* ways
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:44:55 GMT):<br/>
An assessment of code and community
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:44:58 GMT):<br/>
Out of curiousity, what happens if someone does the squash commit anonymously over Tor?  Who is liable?
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:45:19 GMT):<br/>
two assessments - one technical / one health 
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:45:49 GMT):<br/>
CII is a good example of something that bridges whether the community and its processes are healthy and whether the code is objectively healthy.
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:45:54 GMT):<br/>
marketing is concerned on the health and D&I aspects and is very involved on the new tools we are proposing for this 
</p>
<p><strong>takemiyamakoto</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:46:37 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:49:39 GMT):<br/>
Just a general comment:  the DCO interface is pretty annoying.  Is it possible to do a non-per commit sign off?  In other words, when I create an LF account, I sign some statement saying that I agree to follow the DCO when I commit.  Is this possible?
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:53:07 GMT):<br/>
the DCO isn't all that onerous for command line commits but i recall having another challenges with the desktop client... and... a little extra work to make sure you think about IP/license implications of a commit is not a horrible thing
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 21 Mar 2019 14:53:40 GMT):<br/>
I am hoping the work on git signing with DIDs will open up use of Verifiable Credentials to make better tools for that space.  Signed-off-by: <email> isn't a very strong assurance.

TSC should spend more time on technology discussions. 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 14:49:45 GMT):<br/>
well, admittedly this is more technical than discussing events ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 14:50:34 GMT):<br/>
Definitely technical- with links to budget, daily technical work etc.
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 14:51:36 GMT):<br/>
It may make sense for the TSC to outline priorities to the board
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 14:51:40 GMT):<br/>
that's clearly not something the board will take on, so I don't know who else would tackle it
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 14:51:56 GMT):<br/>
not enough funding for CI/CD or contributors summit seems like a miss vs. a booth at event xyz
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 14:52:12 GMT):<br/>
obviously there needs to be outreach to get sponsors but not sure exactly how that allocation is decided
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 14:52:26 GMT):<br/>
agreed
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 14:54:04 GMT):<br/>
maybe the TSC could create a list and we could send a short survey to the top x maintainers at each project about where they could use additional help
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 14:54:31 GMT):<br/>
it seems like technical resources is something the TSC shoudl take on
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 14:54:35 GMT):<br/>
and a prioritization of those resources
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 14:54:36 GMT):<br/>
How about letting more controlled access from projects to admin
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 14:55:00 GMT):<br/>
if this wasn't an either/or question (due to budget) it sounds like we could service both fabric and the other projects
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 14:56:36 GMT):<br/>
To transition Burrow's CI Monax will still be bearing the majority of the cost because we need a cluster to be available to run validators
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 14:56:46 GMT):<br/>
The Indy community has very different needs than Fabric in terms of client code builds and the nature of how pools get setup and tested (customers are identity owners holding credentials more than administrators standing up their own pools).  Even with additional resources and admin access, the Jenkins approach would not be sustainable for us (running an equivalent Jenkins system at the Sovrin Foundation for Continuous Delivery builds on secure infrastructure was more expensive than doing the equivalent with that @dhuseby is proposing).

We can expose pipeline results via a public gitlab instance

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 14:57:15 GMT):<br/>
for unit/integration tests we use circleci for free so that is already public

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 14:58:13 GMT):<br/>
we could use public gitlab

@dhuseby I hate to ask you to do work, but I think a table comparing, contrasting, and going over all of the projects' CI/CD and other testing stuff might make sense.  It would at least give us some of the information we need to move forward.  One of the big issues with the discussion seemed to be that no one knew other projects' CI/CD tooling or approach--just their own.  Some education here might be useful.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 16:12:51 GMT):<br/>
@hartm that's a very good suggestion
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 16:12:57 GMT):<br/>

I'll put up a wiki page today with all of the projects in a table and make notes for each one based on what I can remember about each team's setup
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 16:14:10 GMT):<br/>
then I'll email out to the TSC list and ask for teams to fill it in
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 16:14:17 GMT):<br/>
and/or update what I've written
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 16:14:30 GMT):<br/>
it will just be some notes from each team on what they are doing for CI/CD

<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 00:23:49 GMT):<br/>
The more apropos post is the one about the ffi-support crate out of Mozilla's security team
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 00:24:07 GMT):<br/>
this one: https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/04/crossing-the-rust-ffi-frontier-with-protocol-buffers/
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 00:24:28 GMT):<br/>
it was published this passed Monday so I'm willing to bet it is the latest and greatest thinking out of my old group at Mozilla
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 00:25:06 GMT):<br/>
If you dig into the ffi-support crate you'll see that they adopted a "handle" based approach that avoids passing pointers across the FFI boundary altogether
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 00:25:34 GMT):<br/>
I had just finished telling @MALodder about that design pattern when this blog post hit my inbox.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 13:41:09 GMT):<br/>
@dhuseby As you know, in both approaches the type safety of the data transmitted over the boundary is what should be preserved. With protobufs the type safety is ostensibly preserved (as well as speed). I say ostensibly because the article shows that the .proto file needs to be aligned across the boundary. Another comment they make is that since they ship the components on both sides of the divide, they are better protected against misalignment of the .proto file. We need to be aware of this when writing clients of Ursa or wrapping lower level functions to be surfaced through Ursa. Indeed, the vulnerability surface is much diminished; but it remains and developers need to be vigilant.   
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 18:43:15 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB but if Ursa provides SDK's in languages that call Ursa and uses the protobufs method, then the developers wanting to use Ursa won't have to worry about anything. We could provide Python/Go/JS/Java/C++ classes that use code generated from the protofiles that Ursa would understand.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 18:44:00 GMT):<br/>
but it looks like we won't need to go that far. We're looking at the ffi-support crate. The protobufs method is very tempting though, and it may be how we go.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 18:44:35 GMT):<br/>
but I don't like protobufs. Cap'n Proto seems to be better.

I could not get myself off mute this morning (zoom should really let dial in folks know they have been muted by the system and how to unmute). Anyway, there are two separate scripts in the hyperledger-community-management lab. (1) the get contributors scripts that are used for TSC elections. These scripts use git log and mailmap to get contributors for the specified repos. (2) the project report scripts written in Python that use git apis to get details. The latter is probably what James was talking about with regards to permissions. 
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 14:30:38 GMT):<br/>
I don't know that the permissions issue was resolved. I was running these scripts regularly and uploading the reports to the wiki before I left.

@cbf participation in the committee was and still is open
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:27:05 GMT):<br/>
so if you want to see what we're working on, volunteer for the committee : )

I don't understand the need for secrecy
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:30:22 GMT):<br/>
i think the point is that without access to the docs... no one can follow... and that makes it harder to decide if we want to participate
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:30:54 GMT):<br/>
and there are some of us who don't have the time to actively participate but would like to follow
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:31:00 GMT):<br/>
one document in particular has confidential dollar figures.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:31:49 GMT):<br/>
then that should be restricted to staff and board members or their delegates
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:33:01 GMT):<br/>
@cbf did you email to volunteer and I missed it? or was it in the announcement thread on the TSC mailing list?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:33:26 GMT):<br/>
and @cbf I've been doing open source for a very long time and my reflex is always to be open and transparent
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:33:39 GMT):<br/>
and it took a lot for me to think about this committee differently
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:34:26 GMT):<br/>
i ultimately went the private route after all of the contentious discussions I've had privately with people concerned with our current setup and direction and my desire to get the actual numbers that everybody in the HL community is spending on CI/CD
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:34:38 GMT):<br/>
I wanted to know what the actual total was per month
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:34:56 GMT):<br/>
I think this week's call is the last call, right?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:34:58 GMT):<br/>
now that I know, i can keep that private and open up the rest of the committee space
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:35:00 GMT):<br/>
on Friday?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:35:20 GMT):<br/>
this week's call? the last call for the CI/CD committee?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:35:26 GMT):<br/>
no, the deadline is mid-June
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:35:39 GMT):<br/>
we have 8 more calls
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:35:47 GMT):<br/>
oh OK. I'm obviously mistaken
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:36:40 GMT):<br/>
like I said, if there are concerns with the lack of transparency, I'll open up the committee, I have no problems with that. I was able to get the numbers I was seeking.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:36:58 GMT):<br/>
I made the dollar figure document private, I'll open the space
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:37:28 GMT):<br/>
Sorry. @dhuseby : I made the dollar figure document private, open the space if you wish :)
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:42:58 GMT):<br/>
It sounds appropriate to keep the dollar figures private.
I understand from all previous communications that the committee is open and multiple invitations have been made and continue to be made.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:43:47 GMT):<br/>
That committee will be most productive if it is attended by HL Project maintainers actively involved in their respective CI/CD flows.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:52:00 GMT):<br/>
The committee is open to anybody who wants to participate.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:52:12 GMT):<br/>
I will send out an invite again
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:52:57 GMT):<br/>
So far there are people from Sawtooth, Burrow, and one from the India PSWG I think that just wanted to help.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 18 Apr 2019 14:53:19 GMT):<br/>
I have actively reached out to people from Fabric and Indy and Iroha to participate but haven't heard back yet

Also some general comments on privacy and the amplification and socialization of our work in the current context from 40:00 on- which may or may not be of interest to the rest of the folks. All in all, this is a call to please attend Identity WG where we feature the cutting edge in Identity thought in the Hyperledger community and attempt to publicize and build bridges. Next meeting on May 1st will feature IIW report by Drummond and hopefully Nathan- India Stack consent layer talk by Ajay Jadhav (to be confirmed).

All: Please review the Project Readiness draft. https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Project+Readiness
After a quick read my take is we have some ambiguity on the lifecycle and that may need more specificity. The first take in that draft covers these areas. The second, I think, just reflects a poorly formed request to Dave.
We should just be clearer on what we need to solve which I take to be the first point on lifecycle entrance/exit criteria.

@hartm yes we should have a discussion (and policy?) around pushing projects under the parents as needed
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 02 May 2019 15:02:45 GMT):<br/>
regarding lifecycle, I would like it to be possible for a project to go -> incubate-in-parent-project/labs -> incubation -> sunset from incubation (not because inactive but because unable to deliver on cross-project goals within some timeframe) -> return to incubation (by finding a way to meet those) goals. This might not be a common path, but incubation feels like a one-way ratchet now because since it is seen as a significant demerit to be removed from incubation. I'm inclined to support start-ups that feel they need the incubation status to deliver on some of their goals, but the incubation graveyard problem is that Chris/Arnaud raise are valid. FWIW I think the Aries project is very interesting and the wallet rust code I have seen before in Indy looks great - just hard to judge the cross-project applicability before it ramps up, partly because the footprint of the project is quite large - p2p message, ordering services, atomic key rotation, etc is tricky to get a good intuition for with a few hours reading.

<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 02 May 2019 15:07:13 GMT):<br/>
I do think we need something like subprojects... where they still get marketing and branding support but still expresses the architectural aspect - basically not full project until interop
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 02 May 2019 15:07:19 GMT):<br/>
@mwagner I proposed a notion of sub-project maybe 2 or 3 years ago.  It got shot down then, but I think the time might be right to reviv eit.

I will miss TSC call. Flight that was supposed to get me home last night cancelled. Rebooked this morning on top of TSC mtg. 
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 15:41:05 GMT):<br/>
Next week the CA team will be at an All Hands workshop.  Can anyone here volunteer to do count for quorum, make and post the recording, take notes, and walk thru the agenda?   normally we spread this across the team.  Ry counts and records, Dave takes notes, and I do the agenda.   I know some of you are already familiar with the recordings from your WG meetings? 
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 09 May 2019 20:44:46 GMT):<br/>
@silona with several people traveling next week maybe you can take a quick poll and see who is planning to be available for the call? (I plan to be available)

</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 15:57:20 GMT):<br/>
@rjones : yes. I know that Baohua was working with the Fabric fokks before I left, and he and I were having a hard time getting traction to make that happen. As you mentioned, readthedocs allows for user yo choose the language they want to view the docs in (assuming the translation is available). It would be great to have https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/cn available with all the great work that the TWGC has done.

<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:42:13 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB I do agree, but I think that's fine if it leads to adverserial implementations and additional problems. Not against a more realslistic workload but higher bar to implement and to implement consistently 
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:42:15 GMT):<br/>
@baohua agree... but there also has to be a sense of "satisfaction"... and given that we all have other jobs, what do we get from a working group that spends a year writing a paper that just describes what everybody is already doing?
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:42:58 GMT):<br/>
the best part of the arch groups has been the constructive periods we have...
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:43:07 GMT):<br/>
but those are hard to achieve
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:43:08 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:43:21 GMT):<br/>
There is lots of work to do on code projects, documentation, performance testing etc. There is nothing that prevents people from working on multiple projects...

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:43:43 GMT):<br/>
I appreciated @lehors observation that a focused objective is key to the participation issue.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:44:07 GMT):<br/>
@Dan that is *one* key
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:44:50 GMT):<br/>
@Dan I'm not sure a focused objective is key to participation.  I've generally found that it's just very hard to get people to do work, and that interesting discussions are more likely to spur participation than a focused objective.

<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:45:16 GMT):<br/>
@jsmitchell what prevents multiple project participation is limited time
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:45:35 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman my point is that people working on the code projects are productive
</p>

My observation from participating in both at various times is that the projects are "task oriented" and the WGs (that I've participated in) are "discussion oriented"
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:48:22 GMT):<br/>
we are definitely task oriented
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:48:28 GMT):<br/>
yes... the format is often discussion
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:48:44 GMT):<br/>
but the tasks are "define interoperability issues & capture in a white paper"
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:48:48 GMT):<br/>
@jsmitchell It's very difficult to get people to complete tasks for working groups.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:48:55 GMT):<br/>
So to condense 1. There is need (according to what is being said) 2. There is not enough participation 3. Reasons for not enough participation (no clear goals-lehors) 4. Influence , we need cross-cutting and cohesive 5. As to working groups, they are meant to be technical. 6. Identity has had a reboot due to discussions rather than focus on paper or specific deliverable. We have had more participation. 7. Asynchronous engagement is good (email lists, articles etc.) 
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:49:01 GMT):<br/>
or "capture a framework that can be used to evaluate privacy"
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:49:50 GMT):<br/>
Also reducing frequency is good...
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:49:52 GMT):<br/>
but with an every two week meeting cadence...  if the only time we "work" on it is during the meeting, then we don't get enough accomplished to feel like we're moving forward
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:50:05 GMT):<br/>
hence... we try to do periodic F2F which are much more effective
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:50:14 GMT):<br/>
I guess we are using different definitions of "task oriented"
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:50:50 GMT):<br/>
sawtooth, for example, has daily standups where the folks that have signed up to accomplish something report on their status and whether they need help or have blockers
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:50:51 GMT):<br/>
if you mean we don't have scrums... sure
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:51:07 GMT):<br/>
We can not force people to do anything, but the interests will drive always!
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:51:09 GMT):<br/>
To Mic's point, most of the projects are working round the clock delivering on their requirements etc... groups that are only meeting bi-weekly etc can get pretty far out of synch 
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:51:27 GMT):<br/>
My experience with working groups is that 90% of the work across *all* working groups is done by about a dozen people (or maybe less), most of whom are participating in this chat.  If we want to increase work that's done and focus on tasks, we need to increase this very, very small number of serious contributors rather than focus on general participation.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:51:31 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman re:Architecture WG - I think it would be far more interesting to participate if it was trying to define the "best way" to do particular things, rather than just summarizing the projects. And "best way" project-agnostic, as in almost a spec or idea that projects could implement. So for example, picking up the consensus API ideas from sawtooth and then refining/rewriting them into a non-Sawtooth-specific "the ultimate consensus API - please implement" document. That would define something we could work together on, instead of defining our differences. (Consensus is just one idea, there are lots of areas we could do this.)
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:51:41 GMT):<br/>
and that may be part of the issue we face with getting participation
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:51:42 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman  that is why we need engagement on channel, articles, other thought and cohesive activities- or drawing attention to work in the field
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:51:44 GMT):<br/>
There is plenty of room inside the project delivery model to contribute meaningfully to an arch doc, for example.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:51:56 GMT):<br/>
@amundson +1
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:51:57 GMT):<br/>
As a task on the fabric project, as a task on the sawtooth project, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:52:14 GMT):<br/>
Then, pulling that together into an overall hyperledger view becomes much more manageable
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:52:33 GMT):<br/>
@amundson that's exactly what Ram wants from the group... but the wg has no "teeth" so it would be a largely irrelevant task
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:52:46 GMT):<br/>
@Mic +1.  
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:52:58 GMT):<br/>
btw, we can always change the time of the PSWG meeting if it would help participation 
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:53:02 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman do we want WG's with teeth?  Do any of us have teeth?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:53:27 GMT):<br/>
@amundson, I love the idea--it's research--but it's very hard to get people to actually implement these things.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:53:35 GMT):<br/>
@bbehlendorf that would be one change
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:53:39 GMT):<br/>
but maybe it could be more contextually relevant? eg maybe something like Transact could be the driving motivation for coming up with a consistent transaction API (and possibly runtime) that could be shared across projects
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:54:11 GMT):<br/>
Getting more of the project maintainers active on the WGs so they have skin in the game and are motivated to implement the changes discussed would be preferable to an enforcement-style approach e.g. "the WG decided so you must implement", which is how I interpret teeth
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:54:18 GMT):<br/>
@amundson do you want the arch wg to give you guidelines on what architecture features you need to implement in order to conform with some standards? that's the reason why we've never had "teeth" in that group
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:54:18 GMT):<br/>
@cbf That's project work though, and that sort of thing is being tackled by cross-platform projects (Ursa is essentially doing that in the crypto space).
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:54:35 GMT):<br/>
they should not be research groups... that's a bad path... there is plenty of research in other places
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:55:00 GMT):<br/>
Ursa, Transact, similar component-style projects are what I'd imagine coming out of an active WG cross-project discussion.  Oh look, common needs, common code -> project proposal
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:55:02 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman The academics seem to only care about public blockchains.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:55:13 GMT):<br/>
true
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:55:29 GMT):<br/>
but there are several groups in industry labs that are doing more
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:55:52 GMT):<br/>
are the people who are actually driving the architecture for the code projects participating in the Architecture WG? Are the people who care about performance on the projects participating in the Performance WG?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:56:25 GMT):<br/>
Are they delivering the right requirements? Shouldn't the WGs be drawing attention to what is "out there" so that projects can change their priorities if needed. I have been on engineering teams that have had "death marches" towards the wrong goal.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:57:53 GMT):<br/>
"right" as defined by whom? One would assume they aren't just doing stuff, but are driven by client or user input - I know that is the case for Fabric
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:59:01 GMT):<br/>
i guess if we made the working groups more prescriptive we would likely get more participation from the projects... and maybe to brian's point, if HL has matured to the point where cross-project features are the critical development objective, then it might be a good idea... 
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 14:59:56 GMT):<br/>
A boring observation, but getting completion in a workgroup or a coding project can be related to the same way you would manage other work. Is the task well defined and sized and is it owned? I don't know that I've seen a lot of working group activity that would map into a sprint the same way that I do in coding projects.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:00:00 GMT):<br/>
originally, yes. there are definitely people who know & understand that architectures who are working there
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:00:36 GMT):<br/>
@Dan That's a good start, but people seem to be allergic to doing working group work.  
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:00:44 GMT):<br/>
At a higher level I really like @amundson 's comment about consensus. and @cbf 's comment about transact and transact-ish things.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:01:11 GMT):<br/>
These seem like relevant topics that are cross-project.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:03:59 GMT):<br/>
I agree that in the "short term" that is the way to go. But hard questions need to be asked; i.e. if we do this short term client requirement will it change us in a way that is detrimental to the longer term. I know that is a hard question. Also driven by feature sets that clients suggest only may not yield ground breaking solutions. So yes, "right" is a tough question.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:09:01 GMT):<br/>
@Dan @rjones can we add an item into the backlog for the TSC to discussion the working group structure? I think it can wait until we've made progress on the PLC, but you can put my name by it
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:16:19 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman No, absolutely don't want mandates from a WG on what to implement. But, 100% want documented good ideas or descriptions on how stuff works and why to do it a certain way, and the trade-offs of different approaches. In Sawtooth for example, that could flow into its RFC process. Continuing with the consensus example - it's completely non-trivial to support both non-forking and forking consensus at the same time. It's a super advanced topic. Putting together a paper on how to create a good API/pattern to support both and also all other consensus requirements we can think of seems very worthwhile. (By API  here, I don't literally mean an API spec per-se, but enough description to understand how one would implement the patterns.) And it goes beyond API specs, because (continuing with this example) there are impacts on the rest of the system in features like forking consensus that need to be considered/mitigated. Even if projects deviate from what the arch wg produced, they would likely be able to better articulate _why_ they did it differently (probably for some real benefit that wasn't a priority in the arch wg discussions, which might then hint at doing a revision to the doc).
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:16:50 GMT):<br/>
Anyone can add an item to the backlog on the wiki at any time - please add your name and a preferred date and as @Dan requested kick it off with an email a week before
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:17:41 GMT):<br/>
@amundson are you signing up to write those sections in the arch docs? cause we already have the high level descriptions in the white papers that have been produced
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:18:29 GMT):<br/>
Question:  how do we assure people that do this kind of work that it will be implemented?  I don't think we want WGs to have strong mandates for projects, but it seems like a hard sell to ask people to spend a lot of time working on something like this if they have no guarantees of it being used.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:18:50 GMT):<br/>
@rjones @MicBowman do you agree that this Working Group Structure topic subsumes this dated item "Overall Engagement in Projects (Mark Wagner, Ry Jones, mid-April)"
Or does @rjones and @mwagner want to keep that topic separate?
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:19:14 GMT):<br/>
back to... lovely idea, but there is no particular reason for an individual to choose to put in the kind of time necessary for that task without some form "recompense" (influence, notoriety, business value)
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:19:35 GMT):<br/>
Ry is going to the doctor and will be out today and tomorrow FYI

@dan @MicBowman They should be joined and Mic acn lead :)
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:20:20 GMT):<br/>
the problem is that for many of these activities... the formative stages are past & its hard to justify the amount of work that would be necessary.. .especially since the project teams don't deem it important enough to contribute resources
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:22:39 GMT):<br/>
thanks, mark :)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:22:58 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman yeah, I can help and have others help if we are doing more targeted papers

(and yes thats fine)
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:24:29 GMT):<br/>
@Silona we don't let @MicBowman touch important things like wiki pages. ;)
I've initialized the page for next week with the updated backlog - including Mic's item.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:25:39 GMT):<br/>
thanks... i do have a habit of breaking things, i can add a task force page if that makes sense... its a little early, but it might be good to start pulling some of the ideas out of this chat
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:32:00 GMT):<br/>
@Dan message received. I'll summarize better with less detail.
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:34:12 GMT):<br/>
I have versioning - I can roll it back :-) 
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:34:36 GMT):<br/>
publishing the task force page right now
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:34:41 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman I am thinking the wiki needs a task force section to gather these all together
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:34:53 GMT):<br/>
probably under community
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:34:54 GMT):<br/>
do we have a future agenda template or just put it into today's?
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:35:12 GMT):<br/>
i keep editing today's because we have the minutes
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:35:27 GMT):<br/>
ok... i'll update in a minute
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:36:50 GMT):<br/>
just pushed a "task force" page on working groups, please add yourself to the participants & any notes you want

There are reports that OTC using the phone for TFA is vulnerable to attack, per NIST and some others in the cryptographic community.

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 14:41:25 GMT):<br/>
another thought - identify a maintainer from each project to make an attempt to notify the other maintainers and contributors, in addition to mailing list and other notifications, and see if the number goes up
</p>
<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 14:41:55 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 14:42:58 GMT):<br/>
IMHO, it's OK to have the very general `hyperledger` org, and we can have other labels certainly like a more strict `hyperledger-contributors`
</p>

Maybe we can set some fixed interval for each agenda item next time. No overtime.

@hartm if they do they should not raise a hand :)

<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 14:50:08 GMT):<br/>
@rjones : so git log only returns email (as in get_contributers.sh) and the git api only returns username as in the project reports. Not sure if between the two there is something to link by. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 14:51:05 GMT):<br/>
what I would like the projects that use GitHub to do is make better use of the CODEOWNERs files.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:01:28 GMT):<br/>
we love the CODEOWNERS file - way less fiddling with reviewer assignment
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:01:57 GMT):<br/>
it's just github ids though
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:03:23 GMT):<br/>
yes, CODEOWNERS is orthogonal to the GitHub ID<->email address mapping
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:40:28 GMT):<br/>
We are trying to figure out where to put a couple of projects that solidly land in the realm of apps. I'm very familiar with the thoughts on HL apps projects ("no way"). But, how about a hyperledger-apps github org that operates like labs, where apps have a place to land but can't use the HL name and HL provides only very minimal support of the github org.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 15:53:07 GMT):<br/>
I've been thinking about a mirror org for other reasons
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 16:14:08 GMT):<br/>
I found an org auditing tool written by someone I trust, so I'll have plenty of data for next week.

How does the election process for SIG leadership work?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 17:40:12 GMT):<br/>
SIGs operate outside the purview of the TSC
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 19:30:30 GMT):<br/>
right, but how does it work?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:08:14 GMT):<br/>
show up? https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Special+Interest+Group+%28SIG%29+Process
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:08:41 GMT):<br/>
```Chair Term
The Chair of the SIG will serve for as long as they still want to lead the SIG. At which point, they will inform Hyperledger Point of Contact of their desire to step down from the position. Hyperledger Point of Contact will then appoint another chair with input from the community and existing chair. NOTE: in most cases, we strongly suggest only a single chair. Hyperledger does not encourage co-chairing.```
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:09:07 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 18:04:59 GMT):<br/>
@lehors We're down to four people with commit bits on GitHub that do not have 2FA enabled.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 18:05:46 GMT):<br/>
oh wow, great progress!
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 18:06:12 GMT):<br/>
It is! Of course, that doesn't address the ~200 non-committers without 2FA.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 18:06:28 GMT):<br/>
right...
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 18:06:38 GMT):<br/>
how do you answer the question: why??
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 18:06:57 GMT):<br/>
why what?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 18:07:19 GMT):<br/>
why do we want to enforce 2FA
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 18:07:35 GMT):<br/>
security best practice is the glib answer
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 18:08:02 GMT):<br/>
I understand...
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 18:08:12 GMT):<br/>
@dhuseby  has thoughts I'm sure
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 18:08:12 GMT):<br/>
but some people don't seem to be willing to accept that
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 18:08:52 GMT):<br/>
because if people lose control of accounts, bad things could happen. someone could delete any issue that person has filed, for instance.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 18:09:42 GMT):<br/>
there are destructive things people can do that I don't have a way to undo.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 18:10:47 GMT):<br/>
that's a good point, I think that's the kind of argument we need to pull out
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 18:11:07 GMT):<br/>
it's more concrete than just "best practice"
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 18:11:22 GMT):<br/>
even if it is people don't necessarily appreciate the necessity of it

<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 18:24:50 GMT):<br/>
interesting - my last two corporate jobs required 2FA 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 18:44:39 GMT):<br/>
I'm trying to imagine a scenario where not having 2FA is a bonus
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 20:27:21 GMT):<br/>
I'm pretty sure almost all corporate jobs require 2FA these days.  Even academic institutions do--I know Stanford has 2FA enabled, for instance.  Do we really need to spend time justifying it?  Who isn't willing to accept it?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 20:29:54 GMT):<br/>
I would say its a bonus as much as limitation. 2FA for automated processes is hard to implement. Google doesn't even do it and instead uses auth tokens
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 20:30:15 GMT):<br/>
So if you want automated processes then 2FA AFAIK doesn't work
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 20:32:28 GMT):<br/>
I know we use tokens, and share 2FA seeds for machine accounts via Authy and lastpass.

<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 22:13:30 GMT):<br/>
@lehors the end goal is to have air-tight provenance on every byte of code that goes into a Hyperledger project
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 22:14:00 GMT):<br/>
we as a community have decided to delegate the write bit to spread out the burden and to increase our velocity
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 22:14:48 GMT):<br/>
for us to keep confidence that the only way bytes get merged is through those delegated with that power, we need to have them use 2FA.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 22:15:37 GMT):<br/>
the merge is the only point that new code should get in
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 22:17:30 GMT):<br/>
so yes, "security best practice"
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Tue, 11 Jun 2019 22:18:21 GMT):<br/>
but the longer answer is that the write bit people have a responsibility to protect their access/privileges. if they don't feel up to that responsibility, we can find other people.
</p>

are we giving feedback to the marketing committee or are they giving it to the TSC?

</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 14:20:00 GMT):<br/>
Loose portfolio, with some links. The slide is important as it is on the landing page of the wiki; not just the talks
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 14:20:33 GMT):<br/>
That is the first page people see when they get to the web page
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 14:23:02 GMT):<br/>
Has to be "live", the web-page- Do not think of this as a slide only
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 14:25:15 GMT):<br/>
I agree with Dan here--this is a marketing thing.  We're not the core audience for this, so I'm not sure we need to be deciding on this stuff.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 14:32:40 GMT):<br/>
With Arnaud on this one, it is a double edged sword. Marketing has to align with TSC 
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 14:33:50 GMT):<br/>
we don't have an "official formal process" other than emailing the TSC list and asking for a review and putting it on the TSC agenda for a future meeting

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 14:46:05 GMT):<br/>
Just to restate: Have the landing graphic be simple, with drill-downs and other means to explore more in depth. This can be reproduced in slides with animations if needed. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 14:47:12 GMT):<br/>

"meta" documentation? @cbf 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 14:52:51 GMT):<br/>

@lehors how is next week to come back to the TSC with an update on the lifecycle committee. I'm less concerned with an update on progress and more interested in an idea of whether this looks like a 2 week or 2 month effort.

</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 14:54:48 GMT):<br/>
well, progress has been very slow so I can already say 2 months much more likely than 2 weeks
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 14:55:15 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:00:26 GMT):<br/>
@lehors  you can use "soon" as measure of time, so maybe more like "not soon" vs "soon" ;)
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:00:48 GMT):<br/>
True, there can be a good set of technical writers text wranglers who can function as a resource maybe?
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:05:10 GMT):<br/>
Do such people exist? We pay a full time technical writer to contribute to the projects we work on. We aren't going to pay her to write Iroha docs.
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:06:24 GMT):<br/>
I'm all for the idea of interested people contributing their labor to projects rather than working groups
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:07:37 GMT):<br/>
So let us dissolve all working groups?
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:08:24 GMT):<br/>
If the shoe fits...
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:20:23 GMT):<br/>
@jsmitchell Red Hat pays a lot of people to only work upstream, its one of the foundations of Open Source. You contribute where you can and help the community grow. Everyone wins
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:20:53 GMT):<br/>
each company says "only paying for directly helps me" and the community dies
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:21:06 GMT):<br/>
absolutely. nobody is compelling redhat to work on specific projects though.
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:21:24 GMT):<br/>
nor are they compelling them to participate in specific working groups
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:21:58 GMT):<br/>
my point is: where there is overlap, this work is already being done in a more expert and more productive fashion on the projects
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:22:19 GMT):<br/>
it's hard to talk about this without hurting people's feelings, so I will use an example instead
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:22:35 GMT):<br/>
let's say we had a 'consensus working group'
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:23:27 GMT):<br/>
if that working group is composed of people who are not the expert developers on the projects who are implementing consensus, then there is an approximately zero percent chance that the project developers are going to find value in the work output of the working group
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:23:54 GMT):<br/>
because in order to build the thing, those developers needed to become serious experts in the topic, probably substantially more expert than the participants in the working group
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:24:36 GMT):<br/>
so, we can talk about "how do we get those expert developers involved in the working group", but that starts from the presumption that the working group is a thing that should exist
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:24:59 GMT):<br/>
exactly, thats why you would want experts from the different projects to collaborate together for the betterment of the community
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:25:10 GMT):<br/>
nothing stops projects from collaborating
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:25:41 GMT):<br/>
see: ursa, transact, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:26:06 GMT):<br/>
those are attempts to try to coalesce development across hyperledger
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:27:17 GMT):<br/>
so you are only thinking code, its the other areas where we need to also collaborate
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:27:29 GMT):<br/>
projects aren't only code
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:27:41 GMT):<br/>
the working groups don't produce code as their main output
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:27:49 GMT):<br/>
what do they produce?
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:28:55 GMT):<br/>
well is trying to produce docs and training material, one is focused on architecture, the perf and scale group focuses on performance benchmarks, etc
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:31:40 GMT):<br/>
my observation is that they are struggling to produce those things, and if things get produced they are not highly relevant. When compared to the productivity of the coding projects, they don't register. I think we've got a lot of people looking for ways to contribute, and we should do a better job of driving them to productive contributions in the context of projects (whether specific-solutions or cross-hyperledger)
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 15:46:54 GMT):<br/>
(just to spur discussion with a contrary position) on the other hand... maybe the discussion about the graphic this morning is a symptom of a concern that hyperledger is too "project" focused and needs to be more aligned to more general goals. the working groups represent the needs of *hyperledger* not of the specific projects
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 16:43:39 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman From hyperledger.org: ```Hyperledger is an open source collaborative effort created to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies.```
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 16:44:09 GMT):<br/>
perhaps use that as a framing device, instead of the project oriented frame we use now?
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 16:48:55 GMT):<br/>
@rjones that statement is still pretty ambiguous (which is a good thing because it gives us a lot of flexibility to "figure it out"). how do you think that would impact the role of working groups?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 16:51:21 GMT):<br/>
I think to @jsmitchell 's earlier point, we're too reticent to shut them down. For working groups, right now we have what could be broad coverage - but they're also hard nuts to crack.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 16:51:44 GMT):<br/>
net net: if a WG isn't actually doing the cross-industry blockchain advancement, pull the plug?
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 16:53:10 GMT):<br/>
that works as long as you give the WG some authority to guide projects
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 16:54:17 GMT):<br/>
I don't want to pick on a specific group, let me state it a different way. Has a requirement or use case developed by one of our working groups driven the development of a single feature in any codebase we have?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 16:55:44 GMT):<br/>
I assert work groups are orthogonal to the development process.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 16:56:28 GMT):<br/>
@rjones I can think of one example.  The architecture discussions in the architecture working group helped drive forward the creation of Ursa.  The working group realized (and, importantly, managed to convince others) that modular functionality was ideal, and that some things were easier to modularize than others.  Cryptographic code, of course, is one of the easiest things to modularize in a blockchain.  This line of thinking and work on this at least led indirectly to the creation of Ursa.  
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 16:56:43 GMT):<br/>
In other words, I don't think Ursa would've existed without the architecture working gorup.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 16:56:44 GMT):<br/>
excellent
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 16:57:15 GMT):<br/>
On the other hand, I don't think any code has been created due to the *outputs* of working groups.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 16:57:53 GMT):<br/>
The important factor for me, at least, has been the (very technical) discussions.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 16:59:07 GMT):<br/>
would it be fair to say the architecture working group discovered a requirement for a shared crypto library as a side effect? I'm not saying that's bad.
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 17:00:09 GMT):<br/>
I think that is a good example. It addresses a specific need -- looking for opportunities to converge development and bring projects together. That outcome is a fundamentally different animal than "Here are some semi-informed thoughts about consensus interfaces"
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 17:03:07 GMT):<br/>
I am also of the opinion that our focus on working group outputs has caused some of the participation decline.  People seem very interested in coming together to find areas for collaboration.  They are less interested in writing relatively introductory documents about topics that don't seem to get read by a ton of people.  If we do a working group overhaul, I hope that we can redefine the working group outputs to not be things like the papers that are currently coming out of them and more like reports to the projects and the TSC on technical recommendations and suggestions for collaboration.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 17:03:55 GMT):<br/>
I think the TSC and the project maintainers should be the audience for the working group outputs, not necessarily the general public (unless, of course, a working group wants to focus on this).
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 17:05:15 GMT):<br/>
are quarterly reports too frequent?
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 17:06:05 GMT):<br/>

I think Caliper was heavily influenced by the Perf and Scale WG
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 17:06:08 GMT):<br/>
If we did an overhaul, could working groups send an email to the TSC or project leads saying "here is what we're on about right now" as they desire?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 17:08:16 GMT):<br/>
let me ask a different question. How should I tell non-technical users they can get involved and have the time engaging with the community be well spent?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 17:25:28 GMT):<br/>
The issue is not quarterly reports.  The issue is that the quarterly reports are more about working group participation and how the outputs are going (which, probably, are not read very widely) and less about recommendations to the TSC.  I would much rather have quarterly reports be on the issues.  To continue the example from @jsmitchell , rather than update the TSC on their progress on a paper on "semi-informed thoughts about consensus interfaces," a consensus working group could essentially use their time in front of the TSC to pitch cross-project (or, just general) suggestions about consensus to the group, i.e. "We have studied XYZ in consensus.  After a lot of deliberation with various stakeholders, we think that we can modularize ABC components with UVW."  Or, "After looking at the interface problem for a while, we think ABC is the right interface.  It wouldn't be too much work for projects Alpha, Beta, and Gamma to switch."  Even if the projects ultimately ignored or disregarded this advice, I think it would still be useful (at least moreso than the current working group outputs).
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 17:46:33 GMT):<br/>
Identity WG helped launch Indy and Aries. We have some focused discussions on Identity solutions  and regulations in other  locales like Europe and India and general presentations on eKYC and AML  through FATF, GDPR, CCPA etc.  If you are interested in creating a Blockchain solution these concerns have to be addressed even beyond a framework like Indy. This seems to be more in line with providing a forum for Identity in Blockchain discussions which I do not think is available elsewhere. We are not as focused on the paper.   I have also taken part in Architecture and PSWG quite heavily. The discussion tends to get pretty technical or specific to a domain of knowledge. Our attendance has picked up...
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 19:52:22 GMT):<br/>
This is the way I've always thought about it and described it to others: Hyperledger is more than some mere aggregation of similar projects.  Pick your metaphor - greenhouse, portfolio, wolfpack -  a project comes to Hyperledger, and is accepted, to be integrated into a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.  We don't impose architecture or roadmaps top-down - project teams still have the freedom to decide what to work on and when to ship.  But there are some common standards we require: Apache 2.0 license, use of Github or Gerrit, public discussions, etc, so as to help people new to Hyperledger come up to speed on a project and how we work, as well as to more easily jump from one project to another.  There are many other, opportunistic, bottoms-up opportunities for convergence and collaboration between projects, but sometimes it's hard to lift your head from your own Jira dashboard and check out what others working on that may be similar, what lessons they've learned that might apply to your work, what standards may be relevant to consider, and how to reduce further any zero-value differences between projects that end up being barriers.   For those needs, we use Working Groups focused around these common needs, to bring developers and other contributors from across the different projects together to look at these thematic areas of common interest, and for that to be a good use of everyone's time.  Working Group participants should not view their time there as a charity, but as an obligation; but that obligation should be compensated for in the form of reduced duplication of effort, better designs before coding has begun, better documentation approaches, and so on.

<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 13 Jun 2019 19:54:05 GMT):<br/>
So the WG"s must not be thought of as "those groups that do the boring work so I, as a developer, don't have to", nor as an academic pursuit abstracted from what projects are doing, or as a talk shop.  Each WG has to be thinking about how their topic is reflected upon and alive for the different projects, and make it vital for them.  It should earn its "teeth" not by TSC fiat but because that's where all the smart people are.

@bbehlendorf I agree with this.  The question is how to get the momentum started.  How do we "obligate" people to join in the beginning, when any benefits (in the form of things like reduced duplication, as you put it) are likely only to be seen in the long term?

Twice a year for a WG better in my opinion or even a one of project completion report update.

As previous chair of the Requirements WG ended now some observations to this weeks TSC discussion. The ReqWG produced some excellent quality docs that pin-pointed why the Wall Street banks were reluctant to adopt Fabric (link seems to have gone AWOL on new wiki). Another good report was on next gen MRP. The Orlicky BOM processor algorithm contributed by IBM about 45 years ago is focused on client server. It is ripe for a hl_blockchain approach as it is core to nextgen SAP/Oracle distributed systems (link also AWOL). This brings up my main point contributors to ReqWGs were more solution architects building applications. The carrot to get quality documented and expert input toward hl_ community project adoption is their ability to get feedback that features that they need to move PoCs into production is have a feedback channel from HL overall.

Btw, I am now a minor contributor to ArchWG P&C track. IMO w/o any doubt the other regular participants are top researchers and recognized experts motivated to help guide hl_projects overall toward modularity. The most recent proposals on hl_grid and hl_transact invite multiple project contributors. Salesforce seems to have picked up @hl_sawtooth and combined with a declarative web UI based on Agoric SES. Somewhat covered in WSJ (more on Grid channel). I feel a blockchain builder for noncoders will drive adoption of underlying hl projects spurring use case working groups (https://www.wsj.com/articles/salesforce-rolls-out-blockchain-builder-for-noncoders-11559167641).

Yes stall on long running WG projects. I was thinking try and run smaller WG projects. So that there is an opportunity to publish and gain feedback.

Confluence will experience a short outage on Friday at 9am eastern NYC time zone as we do a hard rebuild of Confluence's indexes to fix a bug.

We apologize for the outage.   We understand that the timing is not ideal but we prefer to do this when full staff is available.  We expect the outage to only be about 15 minutes total.  We will keep everyone posted on chat.hyperledger.org #wiki and #infra-support.

if a project goes end-of-life, I think the lifecycle should also address making it possible for a project to get resurrected
</p>

I'll write up what I was trying to say in an email, actually

don't need to take up time right now
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 14:38:58 GMT):<br/>
so end-of-life should include keeping everything online as a static display with language around "if you want to bring this back, let us know"
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 14:39:21 GMT):<br/>
not trying to avoid process or "lift and shift", this is a complement to quilt
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 14:39:33 GMT):<br/>
much as say a new piece for Fabric wouldmake sense to bring into Fabric

@bbehlendorf right...

I agree
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 14:40:06 GMT):<br/>
"deferred" would be better than eol
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 14:40:34 GMT):<br/>
for resurrection
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 14:41:16 GMT):<br/>
there was also hope that these new parts of Quilet would bring attention to the Java-ILP work currently in Quilt.  The current Quilt folks want this.

<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 14:41:20 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 14:45:14 GMT):<br/>
To set expectations? If a project is not being developed, setting the repo to archived would stop people from filing issues with no hope of resolution

<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 14:47:42 GMT):<br/>

Composer has a strong brand. Many people are using it to develop apps still. I heard that it was being used even now. I heard that it was going to be restarted and many of its shortcomings addressed.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 18:56:42 GMT):<br/>
there was talk about replacing composer with something i think called convector. however, i would strongly prefer to see a project proposal from that team rather than swapping out the code or swapping over the 'brand'.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 18:58:13 GMT):<br/>
Convector is in labs
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 18:58:55 GMT):<br/>
I was not talking about that, there seemed to be people wanting to continue working on composer

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 19:07:08 GMT):<br/>
Or the possibility of a resurrection....especially if code is reused. Chris seemed to think a fork and a new project is what is needed. There are more ways to skin this cat

If, for instance, we renamed Quilt Quilt-java-ilp or something, then brought in a new code base as Quilt-xxx-yyy, how is that different from what Fabric and Sawtooth do today?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 20 Jun 2019 21:08:13 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Fri, 21 Jun 2019 00:16:05 GMT):<br/>
"Completed" may be a better term than even Archived, if there are still users out there who should get security updates in the rare chance they emerge, but otherwise don't expect to see active dev.  Or "Done", as in a steak.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 26 Jun 2019 11:21:18 GMT):<br/>
for projects that use GitHub, I asked to join the Packages beta. You might be able to see this tab: https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/packages it says: ```There aren’t any packages here

@VipinB There is a budget today.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:11:28 GMT):<br/>
@rjones Will there a projected budget for the new CI/CD?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:12:00 GMT):<br/>
Yes, but.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:12:22 GMT):<br/>
Shouldnt the CDI be incorporated into all Working Groups, SIGs and projects
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:12:50 GMT):<br/>
DCI
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:16:23 GMT):<br/>
would DCI recommendations constitute policy or just best practices or guidelines?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:16:42 GMT):<br/>
At first, we would just like to characterize where we are
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:16:53 GMT):<br/>
I ask, because if the intent is to make policy, it might be better to categorize it as more than a WG
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:17:08 GMT):<br/>
like a steering committee council or special task force
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:17:20 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:22:11 GMT):<br/>
@nage could you ask that on the call?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:22:36 GMT):<br/>
There is a participation issue from the ground level on gender diversity in tech. I mean from elementary/middle/high school education to college and beyond
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:22:58 GMT):<br/>
We cannot hope to fix that in Hyperledger alone!
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:23:18 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:23:20 GMT):<br/>
so we should not try?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:26:04 GMT):<br/>
@rjones That is not what I mean. How about engaging at lower level-
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:26:27 GMT):<br/>
Education targeted at gender diversity etc. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:29:32 GMT):<br/>
If you want to talk on the call, please raise your hand

<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:29:53 GMT):<br/>
The point of working group is about deliverables.  This has deliverables. 
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:31:05 GMT):<br/>
I need to drop 
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:31:46 GMT):<br/>
My experience with Sovrin is that deliverables to the general community vs policy deliverables to the governing body are about as different as our distinction between WGs and Projects.  That said I'm fine starting with a WG and evolving it from there (but we should be clear in reports that there is more at stake than just a whitepaper and participation should reflect that)
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:31:47 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @tkuhrt clear example 
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:31:58 GMT):<br/>
It also helps to centralize. like architecture WG 
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:34:18 GMT):<br/>
I had problems at first with it being a WG.  we did a committee and a task force etc etc.  the WG structure is the closest thing we have to what we want to do.

@hartm I'll guess that one would be having a woman run for TSC, since that was the sand that started this

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:36:43 GMT):<br/>
@rjones We can't legislate that.  I was asking more on policies.

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:38:35 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>baohua</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:40:40 GMT):<br/>
Metrics and goal definition, as a good start.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:40:51 GMT):<br/>
I think if you look at the DCI metrics on that page, that gives some idea on stuff other than TSC membership as goals
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 14:40:51 GMT):<br/>
Can we have some of the experts comment on the kinds of programs that might work?  It would be nice to have the experts (i.e. Mandy) provide suggestions rather than engineers.
</p>

<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 15:01:27 GMT):<br/>
Do we have a list of the maintainers for each project?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 15:01:50 GMT):<br/>
Not really.
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 15:01:53 GMT):<br/>
and where they are located (if they are willing to share that info)?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 15:02:05 GMT):<br/>
that list was a topic of discussion a few weeks ago
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 15:02:27 GMT):<br/>
each (most?) project has a maintainers file, and then there is a global maintainers mail list. 
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 15:02:49 GMT):<br/>
the maintainers files can be confusing because of the number of repos
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 15:03:06 GMT):<br/>
One of my goals in using automation for github is to get to where we have these lists for github.
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 15:03:09 GMT):<br/>
just need a `uniq` list from those files (if they are the source of record)
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 15:03:22 GMT):<br/>
and they have uniformity in format
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 15:03:38 GMT):<br/>
so as people are added to codeowners or maintainers files, they get the right permissions automagically
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 15:06:53 GMT):<br/>
FWIW, Hyperledger staff will step back from the planning of this summit and leave it to volunteers from the TSC, unless you want us to help in specific ways.  In particular we know that picking a location and date will be difficult, and don't want to receive flak for being a part of that decision.  Running a survey of maintainers regarding location and date sounds like a good idea though.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 15:14:53 GMT):<br/>
@bbehlendorf I don't think anyone wants the HL staff to not be part of decision-making.  Complaints about this in the past have mostly been related to transparency--people didn't have any insight into why dates and locations were chosen and got frustrated because of this.  Just keeping the technical community informed of the process would probably solve this problem. 
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 15:15:22 GMT):<br/>
If the goal is face-to-face discussion and decision making amongst maintainers on key projects, then an event which doesn't meet that critical mass of key project maintainers will fail. We shouldn't assume that "if we host it, they will come". Rather, we should identify the parties, and determine what can work for them. For example, we have around a dozen maintainers here at Bitwise IO across projects. We don't have the travel budget of HL or Intel, and probably can't justify sending a dozen people across the country, but those are the very people who would make those conversations a success. I'd imagine the same is true for Burrow, Indy, Iroha, and Fabric.
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Thu, 11 Jul 2019 16:03:03 GMT):<br/>
agreed with @jsmitchell -- I would suggest we create a confluence page listing all cross-project proposals and have contributors put their names on the proposals if they can attend. It would allow us to 1) learn critical mass for a topic 2) total attendees.
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Sat, 13 Jul 2019 02:54:03 GMT):<br/>
I can create a blank space for Contributor Summit planning.

Hi Silona, did you get a chance to do this? If not I think one thing we wanted was some sort of survey to see if we could get critical mass on maintainers for Portland Oct 1-2.
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 19:07:32 GMT):<br/>
Sorry, yes you want me to create a space or you want me to participate in the poll?
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 19:09:16 GMT):<br/>
You can also take over the contributors summit page under events
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 17 Jul 2019 21:20:48 GMT):<br/>
Yeah if you could create a page or space specifically for the proposed Oct 1-2 event that would be cool. I see the bootcamps page has `upcoming` and `previous` list. Not sure how to incorporate that but it's not critical. Just so long as we have a page or space to start making headway on Oct 1-2.

</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 14:36:00 GMT):<br/>
maybe SLC in the winter, bring your ski boots
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 14:36:24 GMT):<br/>
That means a large percentage of our Ursa community will be mostly at IIW as well
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 14:36:34 GMT):<br/>
yup

perhaps one can be end of sept week and the other can be october
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 14:43:45 GMT):<br/>
no one from Indy or Aries will attend Oct 1-3, we will encourage this event instead https://internetidentityworkshop.com/

<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 14:55:21 GMT):<br/>
we should announce it on the TSC mailing list

So in case so of you wonder about what the CA"s do when you are waiting for your SIG or project or WG to go live - the open checklists are on the wiki.  For example DCIWG https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/tools/DCI+Working+Group+Checklist

<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 25 Jul 2019 03:11:32 GMT):<br/>
fellow tsc members and Hyperledger staff, it is highly doubtful that I will be to attend this weeks TSC call.

I want to add support for Generation-Xml
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 25 Jul 2019 14:54:16 GMT):<br/>
i don't have a particular issue with new top level platforms *IF* they solve a new problem. or address a particular "optimization point" that has not been addressed previously
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 25 Jul 2019 14:54:49 GMT):<br/>
but a new way to do an old thing is interesting only if it represents a generational advancement
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 25 Jul 2019 14:55:55 GMT):<br/>
I agree with @MicBowman.  If the new frameworks do something new or solve a problem much better than old frameworks, there is merit in bringing them in.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 25 Jul 2019 14:56:59 GMT):<br/>
and the TSC evaluation of a new platform proposal should focus on those properties (among the other basic properties)
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 25 Jul 2019 15:00:07 GMT):<br/>
A note that the Indy WG call, where we did most of the cross-project coordination on identity implementations, is now the Identity WG Implementers call.  If you have a sub-team or group in your project interested in coding identity use cases and interoperability, please join us after this call in #identity-wg and on the zoom call.

</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 15:36:32 GMT):<br/>
is there an agenda for tomorrow's meeting?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 15:41:21 GMT):<br/>
working on it right now as a matter of fact
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 15:41:40 GMT):<br/>
but tldr we need to finalize the project lifecycle resolutions
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 15:43:41 GMT):<br/>
Really need the minutes from ~last week~ 7-25 to get posted (the 7-25 link is mostly copy/paste from 7-18). The recordings are also copy/paste from 7-18 so that's also no help in checking where we left off on some of the votes.

@cbf This seems like a good idea--what do you think is the right size?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 14:10:44 GMT):<br/>
what was the number you have in mind @cbf 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 14:10:52 GMT):<br/>
15?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 14:10:59 GMT):<br/>

My suggestion is that SIG members should vote as well, since they are members of the community as well and contributors
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 14:18:56 GMT):<br/>

Another is that results should be fully exposed as they are in other elections: % of people who voted, % of votes that were won by all candidates

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 14:40:33 GMT):<br/>
There should not be too many...requirements-for first major release- Security Audit, CII badging and some others, main idea is that a small team should be able to do a major release without too much bureaucracy
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 14:42:54 GMT):<br/>
Pipelines are implemented in Indy and demoed in ID WG implementers call https://gitlab.com/stevegoob/indy-sdk/pipelines/74195354

@VipinB thanks...
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 14:50:46 GMT):<br/>
as for the small team doing a first major release, a lot of the technical hoops are driven by me and Ry
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 14:51:02 GMT):<br/>
the security audits I handle and only require maintainers to address any issues that are found
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 14:51:12 GMT):<br/>
the CII badge process I help teams get through
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 14:51:18 GMT):<br/>
Tooling is important in this
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 14:51:28 GMT):<br/>
setting up bug databases, chat, mailing list, etc are all me and Ry
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 14:51:29 GMT):<br/>
CII is basically an audit with a punchlist
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 14:51:34 GMT):<br/>
yup
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 14:51:39 GMT):<br/>
what Ry said
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 14:51:53 GMT):<br/>
it's a forcing function to ensure we've dotted I's and crossed T's
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 14:52:13 GMT):<br/>
oh so it's naval warfare now is it

yup
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 14:54:32 GMT):<br/>
warfare at least
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 14:57:59 GMT):<br/>
@Dan does the TSC need to accept these updates or is that a thing from the past ?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 15:15:05 GMT):<br/>
_I answered verbally in the call, but to close the loop here, No, we do not vote on updates. TSC members acknowledge reviewing the report._ 
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 20:22:27 GMT):<br/>
Also, need to consider license scanning as a requirement for first major release.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 20:23:42 GMT):<br/>
Is license scanning part of the DCO checks or is this separate
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 20:24:27 GMT):<br/>
Separate. License scanning checks that code is appropriately licensed via the charter, and if not requires exception from legal committee if it is to stay part of the code.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 20:25:07 GMT):<br/>
Not sure what status of this process is today. We were doing license scans on a monthly basis previously.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 20:25:45 GMT):<br/>
And then making sure that everything was good before a major release
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 20:26:40 GMT):<br/>
So this scan is automated... are the results shared with the team if you find that this does not pass..
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 20:27:03 GMT):<br/>
Partially automated. Shared with team any exceptions.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 20:27:39 GMT):<br/>
I used to do this by opening up a bug. Then I think I moved to emailing the maintainers.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 20:28:57 GMT):<br/>
We just have to put this as part of the lifecycle and make people aware that such exceptions can stop release in its tracks
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 20:29:12 GMT):<br/>
Yes...completely agree
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 09 Aug 2019 20:31:00 GMT):<br/>
Transparency and help with possible roadblocks will help a lot...
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 13:46:25 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:12:15 GMT):<br/>
No way to look at all updates on confluence. We need to use labels? And filter based on labels.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:14:46 GMT):<br/>
+1 for @VipinB 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:15:01 GMT):<br/>
Consistent usage of labels for discoverability
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:15:10 GMT):<br/>
Maybe something like tsc
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:15:16 GMT):<br/>
"tsc"
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:15:18 GMT):<br/>
I tag meeting notes pages. But if we had a tag structure it would be easy to know which tags to use for what. 
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:16:11 GMT):<br/>
My main problem with tags is that I can figure out how to make the “click to create” template things for pages to include the right tags. AFICT, you can’t add tags to a template that get copied over. 
</p>

Answer that question first...
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:22:08 GMT):<br/>
There may be more than one answer
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:22:18 GMT):<br/>
@rjones thanks, I was chatting and I guess my keyboard can generate feedback
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:23:01 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB that was the first part of my statement, we need to define convergence.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:24:05 GMT):<br/>
Unfortunately @mwagner we all latched on to the second part
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:24:28 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman I actually agree that one DLT will not be the proper solution everywhere. Just wanted to get the discussion going...
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:25:15 GMT):<br/>
@mwagner I think the "convergence" solution is the componetized dream we have all been talking about:  where Hyperledger consists of lots and lots of interoperable modules that can be swapped in and out in a plug-and-play style.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:25:29 GMT):<br/>
But I'm not sure how easy it is to do that.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:26:30 GMT):<br/>
(just to start a discussion) we should focus on components and then focus on the DLT we can build from those components... one of the problems with convergence is that because we have business and emotional investment in existing platforms that we don't want to give up. 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:29:39 GMT):<br/>
@nage that is what we have tried to build a town square, a standing conference in Identity WG- a sort of convergence looking at common problems, even if they are being solved in different ways

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:30:28 GMT):<br/>
That's a nice summary Mic.  I think I'm in favor of the "approve all of the oracles" approach.  If we approve, say, one of the three oracle projects, it's not like the other two are going to go away.  They are probably not going to give up and join the one project in Hyperledger.  They are most likely to continue to work, outside of Hyperledger, and the same community fragmentation that we are worried about will still happen--it just won't entirely be within Hyperledger.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:30:40 GMT):<br/>
I agree with Mic on the idea of having  project per niche. How do we describe such niches? For people approaching projects it would be useful to have a negotiated form of words that describe the tradeoffs made by different projects. This ought to also help with identifying gaps.

Convergence can take place in a few places that don't require one DLT to rule them all:

- p2p layer (e.g. dev p2p, lib p2p)
- keys / identity format
- smart contract layer
- Some types of tooling like monitoring, contract deployment,

<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:32:13 GMT):<br/>
just to be clear... i'm relatively neutral to "all flower bloom" and "manicured garden"... this is really about what our "culture" is (of course the board has a say in this)... there are advantages to both approaches... i just feel like we need to pick one culture and be clear on it 
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:33:11 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman There's a continuum here, obviously--you don't have to be entirely on one side or the other.  Only a sith thinks in absolutes!
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:33:28 GMT):<br/>
I do think that we need to have more coherence... I keep hearing from Brian that it is difficult for staff to present the project landscape because of the need to try to distinguish and differentiate the projects from one another
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:34:01 GMT):<br/>
and I hear from people in the comunity that they are also confused about what we're trying to accomplish with ostensibly competing projects
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:34:11 GMT):<br/>
We should also be clear about why we want convergence. Clearly things like code re-use are not providing enough value to motivate convergence. Is it to make marketing Hyperledger as a platform easier and more competitive vs. other frameworks in the industry. 
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:34:30 GMT):<br/>
Is convergence a goal because Brian's staff has limited bandwidth
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:35:22 GMT):<br/>
HL is unique that way, no other has multiple dlts
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:35:22 GMT):<br/>
well, part of the problem is that code reuse is complicated by virtue of a lack of clearly defined APIs as Mic suggested, and you can't effectively link the code from one project into another with a different language and build env etc
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:35:39 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:37:00 GMT):<br/>
It seems like we can have many projects and try to grow the community and drive convergence naturally while at the same time not having to scale staff and marketing linearly with the number of projects under Hyperledger
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:37:19 GMT):<br/>
Sally Khudiari is their full-time, paid PR and marketing maven.  They do press releases, blog posts, run conferences, many of the same things we do.  But I agree, we can and should be more focused.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:37:43 GMT):<br/>
The variance of quality with apache projects is pretty large 
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:38:18 GMT):<br/>
@cbf brings up a good point.  If we do have lots of projects in the "let the flowers bloom" approach, we need to have a more well-defined marketing strategy.
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:38:22 GMT):<br/>
It seems like we are trying to solve a marketing problem at the expense of growing the HL developer community

<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:38:44 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:41:02 GMT):<br/>
the developer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive for having the projects being open and diverse in that they get to choose.  they just need to know that they are there.
</p>
<p><strong>kelly_</strong> (Thu, 15 Aug 2019 14:41:33 GMT):<br/>
Driving to convergence assumes we have the answers about the appropriate architectures now. There are dozens of new blockchain architectures coming out so while convergence would be great from a developer unity and marketing perspective it still seems too early overall in the blockchain ecosystem and in HL in particular

There were 6 Corda devs that work for Cuba itau (a major bank that sponsored our location) came to the bootcamp in Brazil.  They were thrilled with the roadmaps posted for Caliper, Cello and Explorer and really wanted to figure out how to better work with those teams.   They were VERY thrilled with Indy and Corda-Indy project.   They started grumpy because work made them come and ended up being very glad they came.

In relation to Hyperledger Gardener discussion on TSC today, the name Gardener may be a bit confusing with the rise of https://github.com/gardener/gardener in Kubernetes. As these technologies interact, it may become confusing which “gardener” we are referring to.

<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 14:22:47 GMT):<br/>
One option would be to start Gardener as a lab, see if TCF gets approved, then figure out whether to promote Gardener to a full project or integrate direct into TCF

One question on Gardener:  Hyperledger has been burned before by one-company projects when the company in question decides to change focus (and the project is essentially abandoned).  Gardener seems to have contributors only from one company.  Are there any plans to recruit outside contributors, and, if so, how?
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 14:28:14 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 14:29:23 GMT):<br/>
I don't think there is direct support for this yet - but I think it could be realised by a set of gardener-servers fetching values and then voting. 
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 14:31:05 GMT):<br/>
the receiving contract https://github.com/EspeoBlockchain/gardener-smart-contracts/blob/master/contracts/Oracle.sol#L60 can callback any function
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 14:31:26 GMT):<br/>
so if that callback registers a vote then I think you have a simple decentralised oracle

I'm trying to write useful comments on the TCF wiki page but it's so huge!  As an industry we've been through many of these hoops before (OASIS, IEEE, TCG, GlobalPlatform, the payments industry,...) and there's a lot of security nuance involved in making a 'system' vs a 'set of protocols'.   I'm glad we have another week to formulate thoughts :-)

WASM is just the lower-level interpreter, and Sabre does not implement an ethereum-like smart contract model; from a Transact perspective, integration with Besu would look more like Seth (the integration with Burrow)

This is our team doing a GOTV campaign for the TSC election. The first page are people that did not sign up for the contributor's mailing list, who will contact them, if they have been contacted and the like.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 23 Aug 2019 20:53:26 GMT):<br/>
page 3 are people that are members of the mailing list.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 23 Aug 2019 20:54:05 GMT):<br/>
This spreadsheet is a proxy for the voting rolls for next Monday's election. You do not have to be a member of the mailing list to vote.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sat, 24 Aug 2019 13:41:54 GMT):<br/>
@rjones Get Out The Vote (GOTV) campaign is great.Transparency will truly benefit only if we can track the participation rate (i.e. what percentage of eligible voters actually voted). Having yet another opt-in list for voting will suppress this rate if the list is strictly used to test eligibility. It seems that this is not the case (reading the above exchanges closely). Clean choice architecture, as well as making participation easy is key to bigger participation rates and hence true democracy. This has been seen in many studies.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sat, 24 Aug 2019 15:03:01 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB the GOTV spreadsheet was never meant for non-LF-staff consumption. It was to help us get valid addresses for contributors. I regret ever making that sheet public - I would prefer to do this work in Salesforce, tbh, so people could self-manage
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sat, 24 Aug 2019 18:07:20 GMT):<br/>
I understand @rjones. It is not the spreadsheet and the contents that I am interested in. It is the mechanics of running an election with the maximum participation, which is fair and follows the charter etc.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sat, 24 Aug 2019 18:07:43 GMT):<br/>
I myself did register for the mailing list....
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sat, 24 Aug 2019 18:10:27 GMT):<br/>
Getting email addresses for working group participants who are technical contributors and regulars is difficult. We never require email addresses for participation...

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 17:20:06 GMT):<br/>
It appears that I ended the nomination period earlier than people expected, and opened voting earlier than people expected.

</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 17:33:47 GMT):<br/>
we have a bunch of unresolved issues that need to be addressed directly by the next TSC.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 17:34:26 GMT):<br/>
not just election related.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 17:34:48 GMT):<br/>
fundamental questions about policy and where the lines are on certain issues.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 17:35:13 GMT):<br/>
I have too many days where I stare at my computer and think, "you know, I don't have to ask, I have admin and I can just force this to happen."
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 17:35:20 GMT):<br/>
but I don't. because I believe in the process.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 17:35:36 GMT):<br/>
so those things need the TSC to weigh in on.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 18:11:52 GMT):<br/>
@mwagner the question is: do we restart the election?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 18:12:09 GMT):<br/>
@bbehlendorf asked how hard it was - not very
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 18:13:07 GMT):<br/>
would we give that last person a chance to submit their candidate ?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 18:13:07 GMT):<br/>
I know one person reached out that was unable to nominate themselves, so there is at least one more person that wants to stand for election
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 18:13:25 GMT):<br/>
yes, and I thought you had someone as well from the members list?
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 18:13:46 GMT):<br/>
yes, there was someone from the members list
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 18:16:00 GMT):<br/>
I would be not be opposed to it as several nominations that were within the time window were not able to submit, but its not my call, I will leave that to the Hyperledger staff or the GB

</p>

The DCI WG is working on a community survey. We intend to cover demographics to inform our DCI baseline. if we can kill two birds with one survey we would also like to ask some developer questions. I would like feedback from the TSC on what would be helpful. In the past we asked questions about language preference, git familiarity, and virtualization preferences (e.g. docker v vagrant).
Shorter is better so we want to limit questions to only a few topics.

Naming - TCF is a bit awkward.  It wouldn't be a "framework" as we've used the term, AIUI, more of a library?  Can we give it an abstract name?  Marketing Committee hasn't been asked to approve

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 14:43:55 GMT):<br/>
Not including projects in Hyperledger might result in less fragmentation and more convergence *in Hyperledger* but isn't going to decrease fragmentation and lack of convergence in *the overall blockchain space*.  In fact, including more stuff in Hyperledger probably would actually decrease fragmentation and incompatibility in the overall space.  So I'm not sure that it's a compelling argument that we should not accept projects because we're afraid of fragmentation in Hyperledger--the projects aren't going to go away because we don't accept them, and we would still compete for contributors, users, etc.  
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 14:44:10 GMT):<br/>
I don't think this addresses the product marketing or promotion concern Chris raises, but my belief is that how we collaborate and who is here doing that collaboration makes a bigger impact on our future (what code will happen next) than which code projects we are working on or marketing as "ready" today.  When we stopped doing the old-style hackfests we lost some of that intellectual co-mingling, and it seems like trying to get the right people to come to Hyperledger to collaborate makes a bigger impact that whether there is duplication or overlap in the code we're doing it in right now (there will never be convergence if the communities lack constructive overlap or consideration of each other).  I like Besu because it helps us have more excellent collaborators at the table, I worry about how it overlaps with Burrow (but Silas addressed most of this for me).

Doesn't it come back to the same question/issue that many of us have raised several times recently: that collaboration is great, accepting people is great, and having Hyperledger lead that is great.

But just saying 'convergence' doesn't mean anything: you need guidelines and targets and specific areas where we want to converge, and leave everything else explicitly open-season.

Even with the will to converge, per Brian's comments, it won't happen if we don't actively push and shape it

Doesn't it come back to the same question/issue that many of us have raised several times recently: that collaboration is great, accepting people is great, and having Hyperledger lead that is great.

But just saying 'convergence' doesn't mean anything: you need guidelines and targets and specific areas where we want to converge, and leave everything else explicitly open-season.

Even with the will to converge, per Brian's comments, it won't happen if we don't actively push and shape it

ie: 'what is the Hyperledger Architecture', that we are supposed to ensure conformance with?

the only way to have a managed garden is to have some vision for what we are managing to... 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 14:52:40 GMT):<br/>
Manicured or a natural garden
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 14:52:42 GMT):<br/>
and that means having a body that is more "prescriptive"
</p>

but I will give Dan a pass, I thought this was the last one.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 15:01:13 GMT):<br/>
probably best to give anyone new to the TSC more than a few hours notice to attend their first TSC meeting
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 15:01:45 GMT):<br/>
and elect a chair so the meeting can happen

<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 15:06:40 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 19:45:45 GMT):<br/>
I have a sneaking suspicion that a very minor PR in Ursa (maybe just a small typo fix) would get approved very quickly by the maintainers if the LF ID were BoatyMcBoatFace.  Start now and make it happen next year!
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 19:46:38 GMT):<br/>
I think I looked before and that github ID was taken :(
I didn't look at LFID though.

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 19:54:12 GMT):<br/>
Is a valid voter a valid LFID or an actual person?  I don't think the rules are clear.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 19:54:32 GMT):<br/>
Neither
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 19:54:39 GMT):<br/>
is it just LFID or do  they have to have participated in some way?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 19:55:03 GMT):<br/>
This is up for debate and it is literally the first question I'm going to hit the new TSC with.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 19:55:12 GMT):<br/>
Either way, contributors can technically remain anonymous, so one person could in theory utilize this to vote indefinitely (until we made a rule that only human-known contributors can vote).
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 19:55:17 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for all the hard work on this Ry!
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 19:55:35 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, I've asked this question myself before and people have just said it wasn't a problem we should worry about.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 19:57:18 GMT):<br/>
I still would love the hilarity of announcing, "we had one new contributor, Blocky McChainFace, from CompanyMcCorp."
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 19:58:42 GMT):<br/>
Considering we had < 700 or so possible voters, looking the list over was pretty easy
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 19:59:40 GMT):<br/>
But how do you know that someone didn't create a bunch of fake names and emails?  Easily possible, although I doubt there was a coordinated attack.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 20:00:23 GMT):<br/>
I can't prove a negative.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 20:00:51 GMT):<br/>
Well, you just need to prove that each email is connected to a real human.  Perhaps we need an Indy solution.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 20:01:17 GMT):<br/>
Yes - I would like to dogfood Indy for this.

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 20:14:20 GMT):<br/>
You can automate an attack pretty simply.  Just generate a PR of the form "commit X, uncommit X" so that the overall PR does nothing to the actual files (but does modify the commit history).  This is really easy to script.  Then you can need a repo where you can script acceptance of these PRs (the whitepaper repo would have worked perfectly until recently, as I (and others) had permissions to individually accept PRs.  The hardest part would be automating the process of getting the github and LF IDs, since they have captchas.  You'd have to get someone to give you captcha-breaking software (they might not lend you it if they know you're using it nefariously) or, probably more easily, use mechanical Turk under the guise of a "UI Study" or "Password Study."
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 20:16:24 GMT):<br/>
Not really. There are attacks that are much easier.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 20:16:33 GMT):<br/>
You are seriously overthinking this
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 20:17:50 GMT):<br/>
That one follows the letter of the law, though.  Under our current rules, all of those IDs would be "contributors."  They would have every right under the rules to vote, and couldn't be banned without a rule change.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 20:18:34 GMT):<br/>
But yes, please bring this point to the TSC and get some clarification on rules.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 20:19:00 GMT):<br/>
It's right up Hart's ally
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 20:19:00 GMT):<br/>
It's right up Hart's alley
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 20:19:32 GMT):<br/>
Hart, you are still seriously overthinking this.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 20:20:18 GMT):<br/>
You can forge all of those email addresses as contributors to one commit. You don't need multiple hundreds of commits.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 20:20:32 GMT):<br/>
or hundreds of LFIDs or github accounts.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 20:21:29 GMT):<br/>
@Dan know any non-human persons?  ;-)
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 20:24:33 GMT):<br/>
@rjones Oh, I didn't realize that.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 20:24:51 GMT):<br/>
git lets you do fun things!
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 20:25:42 GMT):<br/>
and, since qq.com is both a source of committers, and just uses strings of digits, that attack may already be happening.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 20:27:09 GMT):<br/>
By the way, I hate asking you to do more work, but do you think it would be possible to make some aggregate statistics on contributors public?  For instance, it'd be interesting to see, and I think listing contributors per company might encourage more participation by companies that don't contribute a ton right now (like mine).
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 20:28:09 GMT):<br/>
yes, but. Many of our most prolific contributors do not use identifiable domains
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 30 Aug 2019 20:28:19 GMT):<br/>
so gmail and qq.com will dominate

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 03 Sep 2019 15:33:22 GMT):<br/>
@rjones The 31% turnout figure with 36 hours to go is quite low... "Nudges" could compare the turnout to voter turnout in other elections and could be sent with 24 and 12 hours to go.  

From IDEA paper https://www.idea.int/sites/default/files/publications/voter-turnout-trends-around-the-world.pdf  and according to them  "Higher voter turnout is in most cases a sign of the vitality of democracy, while lower turnout is usually associated with voter apathy and mistrust of the political process"  

If you look at figure 4 , you will see that the trends are for lower turnout, however the global average is 60%. This is for legislative elections, where the stakes are higher. However 30% turnout from a highly educated (compared to many) and supposedly engaged electorate for the TSC is quite low.


</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 03 Sep 2019 15:34:19 GMT):<br/>

31.623 %
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 03 Sep 2019 15:38:01 GMT):<br/>
We may yet be surprised with a spike in turnout in the last few hours
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 03 Sep 2019 15:38:58 GMT):<br/>
I don't understand your position. Could you be more explicit?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 03 Sep 2019 15:43:15 GMT):<br/>
After all the only thing you (as the election officer) can do is to send out reminder emails. But the wording and timing of the emails matter. I am suggesting an email 24 and then 12 hours before the election, stating how our turnout compares with global averages. Also a hint on how to search for your polling email. Might improve the turnout.

the ranking system is a pain to use for voting. I'm sure there is a reason for it, but can we consider more advanced methods that calculate rankings but don't require the participant to rank directly like MaxDiff
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 05 Sep 2019 14:20:17 GMT):<br/>
On the results, we got more gender diversity with Swetha and Tracy but lost on companies and projects diversity, I'm in favor of expanding the TSC ASAP
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 05 Sep 2019 14:20:40 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder you can put all of the people you want to win ranked "1" and everyone else "31" or whatever
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 05 Sep 2019 14:22:57 GMT):<br/>
I'm not going to paste the results, but for my amusement I diffed the results using each of the ranking methods. Each of the different methods only ended up in one person that won using IRV not making the cut, and one other person being on.

<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 05 Sep 2019 14:28:56 GMT):<br/>
so does it have to be v1.0 for a first major release? no.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 05 Sep 2019 14:29:12 GMT):<br/>
Look at Besu for instance. They are doing their 1.3 release in September
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 05 Sep 2019 14:29:36 GMT):<br/>
I think what we mean by "first major release" is that this is the first full cycle of applying the "Hyperledger way" to the release cycle
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 05 Sep 2019 14:30:04 GMT):<br/>
that includes all of the reviews and the general consensus that it meets our quality metrics and deserves the marketing and community support

"First Major Release

A project’s maintainers seeking to publish a project’s first major release (see semver) must seek approval of the TSC whether in Active or Incubation status as defined above. While it is expected that most projects will have reached an Active status by the time their maintainers seek to announce a first major release, the TSC may approve such requests also in cases where the project is still in Incubation status, should the TSC believe that the project's code is sufficiently mature."

</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 05 Sep 2019 14:48:37 GMT):<br/>
Discovery of security vulnerabilities at any stage even those that have passed a security audit will be bad for the project. Are there continuous automatic security probes that can happen?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 05 Sep 2019 14:50:04 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB GitHub, for example, publishes automatic alerts.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 05 Sep 2019 14:50:21 GMT):<br/>
I was going to show an example, but I didn't want to pick on a specific project.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 05 Sep 2019 14:50:38 GMT):<br/>
Maybe we need to discover a cheaper security auditing process... There must be some thought shed on this @dhuseby  because falling back on budget/time etc. not to do security audit has bit many pieces of software
</p>

PegaSys is cutting a 1.3 release from the Pantheon codeline tonight, finishing up our current development sprint.  We are going to be renaming everything then and moving the codebase over to the HLP next week IIRC.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Wed, 11 Sep 2019 15:46:56 GMT):<br/>
So 1.3 looks to be our last Pantheon release.  It isn't using the HL Besu name yet.

</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 15:45:15 GMT):<br/>
Regarding the role of the TSC/Hyperledger and convergence vs divergence, what benefit does Hyperledger get from having a set of disjoint projects that significantly overlap in features/capabilities but share virtually no technology.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 15:46:41 GMT):<br/>
@rjones Is that a unique problem to potential contributors or to anyone trying to use one of the projects?  My guess is the latter, but wanted to be clear.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 15:47:00 GMT):<br/>
IMHO anyone.
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 15:47:44 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal the other issue is that there is no consistent tooling, processes, etc across projects. So you can't move easily between them

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 15:47:51 GMT):<br/>
For code-a-thons or hackfests or whatever, Composer used to be that onramp.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 15:48:27 GMT):<br/>
Well Composer might have been that for users of the projects, but I doubt it was for potential contributors to a project.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 15:48:41 GMT):<br/>
it was, though?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 15:49:19 GMT):<br/>
Like I said, at the Google blockchain awakens event last year, the majority of teams trying to build solutions were building on composer, and they were coders.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 15:49:27 GMT):<br/>
as an example.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 15:49:58 GMT):<br/>
I understand, but were any of them potential contributors to whichever HL platform they ran their BNA?
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 15:50:19 GMT):<br/>
We're likely to have far more users than contributors
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 15:50:31 GMT):<br/>
Ah, I understand your point.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 15:50:41 GMT):<br/>
Although contributors probably start out as users.  :-)

@mwagner I thought there was an effort to move the projects to a consistent CI/CD pipeline?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 15:54:29 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal I think it's hard (at least in many of the projects) to learn the process for contributing code.  I've seen people who have excellent (fully working and tested) code additions struggle to get it added to various projects because they don't know the proper channels.  I've also seen a lot of people get discouraged from contributing because they issue a PR and no one addresses it.  There are tons of steps in the process of contributing, many of which are obtuse and not clearly laid out.  These often discourage contributors, who will get frustrated and quit.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 15:57:35 GMT):<br/>
@hartm Is this related to Mark's issue?  Also, I have to ask, is this a technical issue that the TSC should focus on, or a community issue that should be addressed by some new WG or SIG focused on community process issues?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 15:59:17 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal I wouldn't be opposed to having a task force dedicated to this problem.  Are you volunteering to lead :wink: ?  That being said, it is definitely a TSC issue, at least in terms of what we've considered historically. 
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 16:02:00 GMT):<br/>
I understand the history (at least to some extent), which is why I raise the question.  Should these process issues be a TSC concern or at least direct concern?  And while I'd be happy to volunteer, as an architect I'm probably the least qualified to lead a group addressing project process definition.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 16:17:31 GMT):<br/>
@rjones So are you suggesting that since it is hard to get started using a project fewer potential contributors will show up?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 16:18:43 GMT):<br/>
Yes. It is quite hard to get a development environment set up. With the deprecation of Jenkins/Gerrit, at least code contribution will happen on one platform
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 16:22:30 GMT):<br/>
The whole concept of Business Process Modeling software is to make the journey from functional design to deployment and operations easier. Composer was targeting this. However, it was focused purely on Fabric, and was not really suitable for production quality deployments. There are other single dlt solutions out there  
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 16:24:02 GMT):<br/>
One for Burrow, some others that I have heard of, but have not used. The whole BPM movement has been around for a while, but has not really lived upto the hype.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 16:25:33 GMT):<br/>
Anyway, Composer has been deprecated, people have spoken about wanting to take this forward. Accord has taken some of the ideas into the Clause project.
</p>

@rjones Is ease of setting up a development environment a project requirement to become a HL project or to exit incubation?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 16:30:35 GMT):<br/>
It is not.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 16:44:11 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal I think beyond the issues already discussed, a larger more general one is we don't have a happy path of discovery. There are a million chat channels, a million mailing lists, it's hard for a new person to know how to engage.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 16:45:00 GMT):<br/>
We have this page: https://www.hyperledger.org/community which as far as I can tell, nobody lands before they end up in chat
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 16:48:10 GMT):<br/>
Although it is useful, that page still doesn't have a linear guide to getting started.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 16:48:53 GMT):<br/>
Presumably we will have soon (or have already had) an influx of people joining for Besu who are both 1) new and 2) technically skilled.  Maybe we could ask them what the pain points are with regards to joining the org, getting on the communication tools, etc.?

FYI... here's the list of proposals for working group changes: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/TF/Working+Group+Task+Force
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 19:31:25 GMT):<br/>
Sorry to poke the hornet nest again, but I'd like to understand the thinking that was in place when the TSC was formed.  According to the Hyperledger Project Charter (https://www.hyperledger.org/about/charter), when the TSC was initially formed, there was a limit of 3 participants from any corporation and its affiliates.  Specifically it says "i. Startup Period: During the first six (6) months after project launch, the TSC voting members shall consist of one (1) appointed representative from each Premier Member and each Top Level Project Maintainer, provided that no company (including related companies or affiliates under common control) shall have more than three (3) votes on the TSC."
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 19:33:04 GMT):<br/>
So why was that diversity requirement present at the initial forming of the TSC, but not in subsequent TSC forming?  Was it an oversight?  Intentional?  I realize that subsequent TSC members were decided by election, but how does that change the concern around diversity?

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:21:31 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal You'd have to ask the people who wrote the charter.  I'm not sure how many of those people who participated are left, and I'm not sure how much the TSC participated in writing the charter.  Based on my records, maybe Chris, Mic, Satoshi (Oshima), and Stan were on the TSC when that happened (I joined about a month after the charter passed).
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:22:16 GMT):<br/>
Actually, I'm wrong.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:22:22 GMT):<br/>
@hartm That's why I'm asking here.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:22:27 GMT):<br/>
Wrong?  never!
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:22:41 GMT):<br/>
We discussed it during the meeting on June 23rd, 2016.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:22:42 GMT):<br/>
LOL.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:23:20 GMT):<br/>
But it seems like it was previously set in the charter, and we didn't change it.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:23:28 GMT):<br/>
Seriously?  Are there meeting notes to see what was discussed?  Seems more like a governing board issue than a TSC issue unless the TSC governs itself.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:23:50 GMT):<br/>
Definitely a governing board issue.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:24:03 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, you ought to be able to find the meeting notes in the archive.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:24:06 GMT):<br/>
it does. the charter allows the TSC a lot of latitude in governance.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:24:14 GMT):<br/>
How does one approach the governing board to get their take on this?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:24:15 GMT):<br/>
If not, I can forward you the email with the meeting summary.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:24:41 GMT):<br/>
@rjones Really?  The TSC gets to decide who can be on the TSC?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:24:58 GMT):<br/>
Read the charter carefully. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:25:44 GMT):<br/>
```After the Startup Period, there shall be a nomination and election period for electing Contributors or Maintainers to the TSC. The TSC voting members shall consist of eleven (11) elected Contributors or Maintainers chosen by the Active Contributors. An Active Contributor is defined as any Contributor who has had a contribution accepted into the codebase during the prior twelve (12) months.```
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:25:58 GMT):<br/>
I've read it and it seems as though the governing board established the policies for TSC membership.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:26:03 GMT):<br/>
@rjones I don't see where the charter mentions the TSC can change the number of people on it.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:26:12 GMT):<br/>
Right, that is a governing board policy
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:27:02 GMT):<br/>
@hartm the number of seats is a board policy. Who may or may not serve is clearly laid out.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:27:12 GMT):<br/>
The set of people that can vote it slightly wider
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:27:13 GMT):<br/>
As well, we've clearly extended the definition of an Active Contributor as it included WG participation which doesn't contribute to the codebase.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:29:03 GMT):<br/>
The TSC did last year, but there was no vote this year.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:29:31 GMT):<br/>
OK, so I guess we could add diversity restrictions without board approval, but couldn't change the number of seats.  Is this right @rjones ?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:30:03 GMT):<br/>
I would need to defer to Dolan
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:30:27 GMT):<br/>
I'd still like to know the reasoning behind the initial diversity requirement and why it wasn't extended past the Startup Period
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:30:48 GMT):<br/>
Can we figure this out?  I guess we'll probably want board approval anyway since the consensus seems to be to change the number of seats.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:32:10 GMT):<br/>
you have as much information as I have about the reasoning.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:35:03 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal I don't think it was discussed too thoroughly by the TSC.  I don't recall much about the discussion, but it has been three and a half years, so it could just be a lost memory.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:36:01 GMT):<br/>
I certainly don't think there was any malicious non-inclusion of that clause.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:36:42 GMT):<br/>
In the meeting minutes there was an action item to establish a process.  Was that ever done?  It also seems a bit weird that the TSC gets to decide the process, timeline, and criteria for electing the steady state TSC.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:38:27 GMT):<br/>
@hartm So it would seem the charter basically says the TSC can decide however it wants who can be on the TSC?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:40:04 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal Yep, that's basically correct.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:41:12 GMT):<br/>
@rjones The voting this year AFAIK included not only "Active Contributors", at least as defined in the charter, but others that contributed to WG?  Isn't that in contradiction to the charter?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:42:17 GMT):<br/>
Not all voters are eligible to run for the TSC
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:42:40 GMT):<br/>
No--article 4,c,iii states that the TSC can redefine contributor.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:43:49 GMT):<br/>
@hartm interesting.  Sorry for not going through all the TSC minutes, but was that done?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:44:47 GMT):<br/>
If I recall correctly:  at the first election, the (existing) TSC mandated that working group members count as contributors.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:47:19 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal By the way, if you're interested in this process, the best thing to do is write a proposal or summarize your ideas and post here:  https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Pending+topics+for+the+TSC. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:47:21 GMT):<br/>
the initial TSC only has a few familiar names: ```
Emmanuel Viale Accenture
Kireeti Reddy CME Group
Shaul Kfir DAH
Stefan Teis Deutsche Boerse Group
Pardha Vishnumolakala DTCC
Kei Taniuchi Fujitsu
TBD Hitachi
Chris Ferris IBM
Mic Bowman Intel
David Voell J.P. Morgan

Kireeti Reddy->Stan Shaul Kfir->Tamas Blummer Kei Taniuchi->Hart Montgomery this happened pretty much at the first meeting (I was present)
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 22:59:10 GMT):<br/>
Or soon thereafter
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:00:06 GMT):<br/>
Where did I read about technical contributions (not specific to the codebase)- Brian had sent it around
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:02:18 GMT):<br/>
We did agitate for votes from Working Groups, not just a roundup of all people whose contributions made it to github (since that could be just a spelling correction); in fact I had people telling me to make a spelling correction to get on the voter list
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:03:35 GMT):<br/>
We got votes for the WG in the first election; we had to rejoin that struggle in the second as well when it was memorialized...
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:04:27 GMT):<br/>
The first TSC was not elected...

<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:08:12 GMT):<br/>
@hartm That's the process?  Edit a wiki page?
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:08:44 GMT):<br/>
So HLP Codebase is the key term here... By having docs and tech artifacts in Googledocs and not github the WGs were excluded.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:08:50 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal It's obviously not the whole process, but it's the best way to start.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:09:14 GMT):<br/>
Now with the addition of wiki, the net is even spread wider
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:11:06 GMT):<br/>
However, the main difference here is the fact that github is gated through the maintainers, whereas anyone can contribute through googledocs, wikis etc.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:15:31 GMT):<br/>
The spirit of the charter is technical contributors; if you say only code in github is technical contribution that is a narrow interpretation IMHO
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:16:26 GMT):<br/>
And the tools dont even measure that, even if you change an RFC or comments in code you are in.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:17:27 GMT):<br/>
I also support @toddinpal 's interpretation of limits of an org
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:17:28 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB Agreed...
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:17:53 GMT):<br/>
Agreed that is about what constitutes technical contribution that is
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:18:51 GMT):<br/>
If working groups are under the TSC, then why wouldn't working group participants, regardless of whether they write something, be considered technical contributors?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:19:36 GMT):<br/>
I think you're confusing those who can run for the TSC, and those who can vote.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:20:07 GMT):<br/>
Not at all, they are the same Active Contributors
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:20:42 GMT):<br/>
Contributor is defined later, but active contributors can all vote and run
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:21:03 GMT):<br/>
active being a contributor in the last 12 months
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:21:46 GMT):<br/>
@rjones not sure I understand why there was or should be a distinction.  If you contribute, it seems you should be able to vote, run, or both.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:22:09 GMT):<br/>
In fact @toddinpal that is true- no confusion there
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:22:09 GMT):<br/>
Were all the current TSC members Active Contributors?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:22:36 GMT):<br/>
IANAL. I am attempting a good faith reading of the charter. I disagree with your reading of it.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:23:19 GMT):<br/>
What do you disagree with? the electoral body can both vote and run, there is no confusion there
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:23:47 GMT):<br/>
You assert that.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:24:21 GMT):<br/>
The charter asserts that
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:24:30 GMT):<br/>
Anyone who can vote can run
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:25:55 GMT):<br/>
It is only the word "codebase" that has been interpreted to mean git hub
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 12 Sep 2019 23:27:28 GMT):<br/>
Even though the charter talks about technical artifacts and documentation
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 00:48:32 GMT):<br/>
Instead of going over the current text at the level of a Supreme Court case, it might be more productive if we wrote a new one.  We will have to update the document if we want to change the size of the TSC anyway...
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 00:57:45 GMT):<br/>
@hartm I like the idea and it's probably something that will have to get approved by the governing board if the number of members are to change.  Care to take a whack at how things should read?  Personally I'd like to see: 1) TSC membership should be limited to those that have contributed to Hyperledger in some technical capacity.  This could be code contribution, white paper contributions, working group contributions, or other contributions that help the technical HL community.  2) TSC eligibility and voting eligibility should be the same, i.e., someone that has contributed to the technical advancement of HL.  3) No more than 25% of the TSC membership can be from one organization or their affiliated organization as was stipulated in the Startup Period, 4) the TSC should should be expanded to 15 members.   Thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 00:59:43 GMT):<br/>
@toddinpal Can you put this in the wiki discussion page rather than the chat?  That way it's easier for others to comment.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 01:00:21 GMT):<br/>
Ideally, follow from the example from Arnaud and Mic and do a line-by-line itemization.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 01:02:04 GMT):<br/>
Some of your proposals have broad consensus (i.e. expanding the TSC) while others may not (the company diversity metric).  It will be good if people can state their opinion of each of these.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 01:03:03 GMT):<br/>
So just to be clear, edit the wiki and add a new child page?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 01:06:37 GMT):<br/>
Yep!  I would add it in the task force work:  https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Pending+topics+for+the+TSC

@klenik we don't really do presentations any more - it's more of a forum for you to express needs or wants from the project to the TSC
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Mon, 23 Sep 2019 20:38:17 GMT):<br/>
@rjones Ah, okay. Then the reminder email's text is out of date :) In that case, everything is in the project update, no TSC-level help is needed right now for Caliper :thumbsup: 
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 07:12:17 GMT):<br/>
Hi @klenik The idea is the TSC members should read the report beforehand and respond using the comments fields. During the TSC meeting a project representative can handle clarifications or highlight some need.
Some days we have more time in the agenda for discussion and other times we might not have any and need to rely on the comments section of the update.
</p>
<p><strong>klenik</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 07:17:07 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the clarification @Dan. I will address any questions you have in the comments, and I'll also be on the call just in case :ok_hand: 
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 12:48:08 GMT):<br/>
@rjones is there a way for you to update the calendar invites so that the message no longer reads "is available to present it to the TSC" but instead says something like "is available to discuss it with the TSC"?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 12:48:36 GMT):<br/>
I fear this probably means for you to update every single calendar entry though...

@mastersingh24 give me access to a z machine and I’ll make rust work on it well. I was the guy who bootstrapped rust on several different ISA’s and all of the BSD variants a few years ago.

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 14:32:18 GMT):<br/>
One of the reasons why we started Ursa was that the "everyone write their own implementation" paradigm wasn't working for us.  Projects were getting their implementations wrong--we didn't have enough cryptographers and cryptographic engineers to review and implement everything, and mistakes were made.
</p>

Maybe @mastersingh24 concerns could be met by making Ursa compilable as a stand-alone network service? That would also make my concerns about removing pointer passing across the API by settling on a standard serialization/deserialization system.

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 14:56:18 GMT):<br/>
It can be useful to have different maintainer lists due to area of expertise.  For instance, if you're reviewing cryptographic code, you want to have both people who understand the math and people who are very good implementers review the code.  Lists of different maintainers can be used to make sure this happens.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 14:56:50 GMT):<br/>
I think we are reading too much into this.  We expect from a decision process perspective all maintainers have a maintainer vote and they need to work out between themselves who maintains which pieces and how they resolve conflict

If one maintainer knows more stuff then the others usually naturally defer to them on those issues (in Aries, for example, Tomislav knows way more about dot net, so we listen to him on those issues)
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 15:05:09 GMT):<br/>
The Mozilla model for Firefox and the Linux kernel model and the Git model all work very well. I suggest we just copy one of those and force all projects to use the same model for organizing and maintaining the source code. Because 1) we would be adopting one of the time-tested and familiar models and 2) if all of our projects were managed the same way it would drastically reduce the befuddlement of newcomers that we hear about all of the time. 
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 15:07:15 GMT):<br/>
And while I’m at it, let’s pick one CI system and force all project to use it. Because consistency will be unified metrics, security procedures and massive amounts of automation that will give us reproducible builds, automated release management, automated maintenance (e.g. contributors and who can vote for the TSC)
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 15:07:42 GMT):<br/>
I am now fully behind the philosophy of pick one and force all projects to adopt. 
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 15:09:09 GMT):<br/>
There is simply too much friction in the way we are doing...uh...everything. And for what? So everybody has happy feelings?

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 16:16:41 GMT):<br/>
@Dan - I am attempting to better formulate my concern (and why I am not so convinced on the simplicity). I think there great benefits to working on code in the Hyperledger community. (among them: collaboration, interop, common code contribution process, visibility). I also think we can experience issues if there isn't enough oxygen to allow for "related/sub/minor" projects to operate under the Hyperledger processes. I have not thought that the "labs" concept is a sufficient solution - this word has the connotation of a PoC. I also am wary if we have "code owners" working diligently at their components if they end up with a "2nd tier" role/voice in the overall project.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 16:17:45 GMT):<br/>
I am not trying to say that the TSC should micro-manage (it should not), but rather we should have a common set of role guidelines and ensure their is oxygen for innovation and interoperability in the larger community.

My interpretation of the proposal / opinion is the following:

- There will only be projects and labs
- If some entity wants to bring their wares to Hyperledger as a project, they will need to meet the criteria for a project and they will need to follow the project lifecycle
- If a project proposal comes to Hyperledger which is related to another project, that project can choose / offer to bring the proposed project under it's umbrella (but this means it is considered part of that project)
- Projects under an umbrella should share the same prefix (e.g. sawtooth-, fabric-, indy-, besu-,burrow-)
- If an entity proposes a related project and that project does not want it under it's umbrella or the proposed project does not want to be under the umbrella, then it must  not use the related project's name as a "prefix"

<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 26 Sep 2019 17:39:46 GMT):<br/>
Personally I think if the code does not already exist outside of Hyperledger then it likely should not meet project entry criteria.  Of course labs are an exception.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 27 Sep 2019 05:58:14 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda I hear you, and that's part of the history of this proposal that some second tier projects would get forced under higher tier projects. I think that what's gotten confusing is instead of just voting `no` to that proposal we tried to rephrase a negative proposal to vote `yes` on. I think @mastersingh24 has captured the end goal well and this is effectively the status quo (but for maybe formalizing things like the naming).
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 27 Sep 2019 06:04:59 GMT):<br/>

I struggle to see the point of an organization which is just “a collection of everything blockchain”, complete with multiple overlapping competing work and incompatible tool and deployment sets. There’s definitely no need (indeed there is an anti-need) for a TSC in that case.

And if anyone says “Apache”, I’m going to claim Godwin’s Law ;-)

The question is whether or not we think there is a natural drift or movement towards convergence.  I'd say yes, but that's open to debate.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Tue, 01 Oct 2019 22:30:03 GMT):<br/>
Frankly, I would think that cross platform and convergence work should be done in Working Groups.  This is also the reason we have the TSC. Agree with @JonGeater  there.This is the natural place for it. there are episodes where there is collaboration between projects for narrow purposes. Code alone isl not enough as we have seen from many examples in the real world.

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 15:02:59 GMT):<br/>
yes, that sounds like a good idea
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 15:05:31 GMT):<br/>
fyi, we're now talking about how to gather the notes
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 15:05:49 GMT):<br/>
so people who weren't here can go through them
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 15:24:47 GMT):<br/>
the wiki, maybe?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 10 Oct 2019 15:28:47 GMT):<br/>
Yes, we asked people to add notes to the event's wiki. Some have already dumped notes to respective :rocket: chat channel or lists. We will also pull together a summary.

Are any of these videos uploaded to youtube? Nicer way to browse with a subscription rather than a thousand wiki pages.

<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Fri, 11 Oct 2019 22:14:15 GMT):<br/>
(suggesting in addition, not repalcement)

<p><strong>MHBauer</strong> (Fri, 11 Oct 2019 23:02:17 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sat, 12 Oct 2019 01:17:45 GMT):<br/>
they aren't. I agree they should be on YouTube.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 12 Oct 2019 04:12:44 GMT):<br/>
So if we uploaded contributor calls for other projects do we need TSC approval or is it just a "go and do" thing?

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 13 Oct 2019 06:02:32 GMT):<br/>

it is about permanence and anti-trust.  We ask that you centralize in the wiki and we are going to begin automating checking it.

Hi all.  Is anyone aware of any telemetry recording done by any Hyperledger project?  Where any of our code phones-home to third party services to report on usage, etc?  I don't mean things like Dockerhub etc.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 11:22:43 GMT):<br/>
I assume you mean reporting to a project-controlled account like crashlytics, but Burrow reports to Prometheus electively, but not any account/instance we control.

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 14:11:35 GMT):<br/>
For a state proof, is a threshold signature (from the blockchain) on a transaction sufficient?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 14:14:01 GMT):<br/>
@nage I guess I should show up to the consensus call if I want this question answered, but is the bottleneck communication or computation?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 14:16:19 GMT):<br/>
BFT --> finality but finality -/-> BFT
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 14:20:14 GMT):<br/>
in fact, in many BFT consensus mechanisms you don't have finality
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 14:20:20 GMT):<br/>
because you can always FORK
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 14:20:30 GMT):<br/>
Sawtooth could provide BFT & Finality but would need to add state proofs. 
or likewise, Fabric could add BFT and state proofs.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 14:20:48 GMT):<br/>
Something for the Indy folks to consider.
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 14:20:49 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 14:21:12 GMT):<br/>
OK, *traditional* BFT algorithms --> finality.  
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 14:21:20 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for pointing that out Chris.

</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 14:35:15 GMT):<br/>
Right now with the RBFT implementation it is the Python GIL, more so than computation or communication.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 14:44:40 GMT):<br/>

https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-community-management-tools/tree/master/get_contributors is how we pull from the repositories today for the TSC election list
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 14:53:49 GMT):<br/>
the problem with that script is that we have to maintain the "mailmap" file
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 14:53:53 GMT):<br/>
and how is that version controlled?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 14:57:26 GMT):<br/>
It would be good to have a simple rule that can be automated (other than the email address mapping on top). E.g., directly derived from git commit.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 14:57:48 GMT):<br/>
Tracy's scripts pull all of the authors of each git commit and remaps using a mailmap file and removes any commits created by tools
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 31 Oct 2019 14:58:07 GMT):<br/>
If it's a simple rule then hopefully we can reduce how many times this topic needs to be discussed.

<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 01 Nov 2019 21:29:37 GMT):<br/>
Our latest benchmarks show that we are CPU bound on the processing of messages by each RBFT replica. The Python GIL complicates removing that bottleneck.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Sun, 03 Nov 2019 11:23:56 GMT):<br/>
Is there technical material on the scaling of replicas with your RBFT implementation
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Sun, 03 Nov 2019 15:31:00 GMT):<br/>
Not as much as I would like, but some.  #indy-ledger-next is the right place to ask.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:20:09 GMT):<br/>
Yes, the TSIGs should ideally spawn task forces.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:20:39 GMT):<br/>
Example:  some architecture working group talks get people interested in a particular topic.  Some group forms a task force to consider the feasibility of building a lab on that topic.
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:33:25 GMT):<br/>
thank you Tracy! for thinking of the amt of work for your old team that a renaming will create! 
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:35:02 GMT):<br/>
I would advise wiki and chat for Task forces
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:35:11 GMT):<br/>
I had the impression that task forces would be for work product (rather than working groups).
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:35:19 GMT):<br/>
mailing lists get more awkward
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:35:25 GMT):<br/>
I am perhaps a bit confused on the difference now.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:38:22 GMT):<br/>
I only marked A-D as resolved, not A-F
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:41:13 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda task forces can come from many places, many of the recent task forces have been operational and created as a result of requests from the TSC
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:41:43 GMT):<br/>
e.g. project lifecycle, working groups, dci, ...
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:43:33 GMT):<br/>
I like formal sub projects because that is our list of candidates for new interop too-level projects. 
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:43:33 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:44:13 GMT):<br/>
For instance, Indy-Crypto was a “sub project” of Indy. It became Hyperledger Ursa and now has Hyperledger-wide scope. 
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:45:48 GMT):<br/>
Encouraging encapsulation of large, original sub-projects is a good thing. It will encourage more interop. I think having formal sub-projects may encourage that. 
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:46:12 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:47:28 GMT):<br/>
TSC reviews the initial proposal, the active status, and then the X.0 releases (currently) 
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:52:13 GMT):<br/>
Speaking of x.0 releases I noticed Quilt had a 1.0 release that was not brought to the TSC. 
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:53:02 GMT):<br/>
yes that was a miscommunication.  a 1.0 release to them is not a production release.  they only do whole numbers at ILP...
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:54:13 GMT):<br/>
It closes the issue for now, until a year down the road, when we forget we discussed it and go over it again... ;)
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:54:18 GMT):<br/>
Also the change was not reflected in the Product lifecycle pages.  
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:57:24 GMT):<br/>
Would it change the discussion on this if I landed a PR with everyone in my email contacts on the commit list?
</p>
<p><strong>mpiekarska</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:57:49 GMT):<br/>
Shouldn’t we just say that if someone inputs invalid email they opt out from voting? If they don’t want to be associated with Hyperledger they might not want to vote anyway?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:58:19 GMT):<br/>
Besu project also needs a vote on active status
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:58:36 GMT):<br/>
no because having a public email on github sucks because anyone can harvest it
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:59:13 GMT):<br/>
All of this will go away when we’re all landing our own DID docs in the repos we’re associated with. Decentralized identity for the win. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:59:32 GMT):<br/>
`git commit -s ...` publishes your email, anyway
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 15:59:40 GMT):<br/>
In-band identity management is the only way this gets “clean” and “easy”

seems like a related issue.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 07 Nov 2019 16:03:20 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:31:03 GMT):<br/>
Zoom is enforcing expediency!
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:32:08 GMT):<br/>
I think Chris's approach is fine as long as we make task force approval very lightweight.  If people can get fast (maybe even via email without discussion in a meeting) approval of a task force, then all of these issues are moot.  If people have to wait a month before the task force approval to get discussed in a meeting, then it's a problem.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:32:41 GMT):<br/>
I think there's no point to forcing an existing structured group to create a bunch of other overhead. 
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:33:45 GMT):<br/>
The proposal was to not require WGs to deliver because they still had value in discussions. 
TF's were an outlet for when we have issues that arise with no team to address them.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:35:04 GMT):<br/>
@Dan I'm more OK with it if it is in the form of "we are approving your deliverable."  I hope it's less of existing overhead and more "TSC, you must read my deliverable" (which is a good thing, in my opinion).  I generally agree with you but I don't think it's the majority opinion.

<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:36:57 GMT):<br/>
Hey everyone!   Just coping some notes which I made on the Zoom chat and was asked to redirect to here.

The ETC support in Besu is pretty much done.   https://github.com/ChainSafe/besu syncs to head successfully.
Perhaps 3/4 or more of the code has already been upstreamed:

"ETC Configuration, classic fork peer validator"
https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/176

"ETC DieHard fork support"
https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/177

"ETC Gotham Fork"
https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/178

Pending is "ETC Atlantis fork" which then gets vanilla HL Besu nodes live on the ETC mainnet.

</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:38:58 GMT):<br/>
but do you feel better ?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:39:31 GMT):<br/>
So to recap. Change in WGs is because _some_ WGs were unable to fulfill chartered deliverables yet could still offer value from discussions. The goal in making a change was never to prevent delivery or create new obstacles..

Hey everyone! Just coping some notes which I made on the Zoom chat and was asked to redirect to here.

The ETC support in Besu is pretty much done. https://github.com/ChainSafe/besu syncs to head successfully.
Perhaps 3/4 or more of the code has already been upstreamed:

"ETC Configuration, classic fork peer validator"
https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/176

"ETC DieHard fork support"
https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/177

"ETC Gotham Fork"
https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/178

Pending is "ETC Atlantis fork" which then gets vanilla HL Besu nodes live on the ETC mainnet.
https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/179

<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:43:30 GMT):<br/>
That support will be a point-release very soon.   Not sure of release schedule off-hand.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:46:01 GMT):<br/>
Can we talk about Besu instead of this?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:46:22 GMT):<br/>
I really wish we would push this to the back of the discussion since we get stuck on it seemingly every week.
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:50:21 GMT):<br/>
ETC Cooperative are committed to supporting Besu indefinitely.
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:51:25 GMT):<br/>
Whatever PegaSys does in the future.
So we have at least "two legs".
But your point is fair.
It is still early.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:51:35 GMT):<br/>
Did Gari rejoin us? I think he had something he wanted to discuss on this agenda item (Besu).
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:52:20 GMT):<br/>
What other companies are supporting Besu, @grace.hartley?
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:52:20 GMT):<br/>
I am here representing ETC Cooperative, who were today announced as the latest members of Hyperledger.

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:52:53 GMT):<br/>
What's the percentage of Consensys contributors on Besu versus the percentage of Soramitsu contributors when we approved Iroha for active status?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:53:33 GMT):<br/>
And what did we learn from that?
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:54:18 GMT):<br/>
What is the diversity NOW for Iroha?
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:55:40 GMT):<br/>
Because I would agree that "blessing" prematurely would be a mistake.
</p>
<p><strong>grace.hartley</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:58:06 GMT):<br/>
@hartm There are approximately 20 contributors from Besu in the last 6 weeks (give or take). There were about 7 or 8 contributors outside of PegaSys over the last 6 weeks. I can follow up with the exact numbers shortly after this meeting.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:58:48 GMT):<br/>
@grace.hartley Awesome!  Emailing out that to the TSC list (and posting on the wiki page for this discussion) would be really helpful.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 19:17:17 GMT):<br/>
Where do we submit discussion items for future consideration in the agenda backlog?  Here? Directly to Arnaud (as the TSC chair)?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 19 Nov 2019 19:19:52 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon I suspect either will work.  You may also be able to modify or comment on the agenda directly, depending on how permissions are set.

<p><strong>grace.hartley</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:12:13 GMT):<br/>
For the group's reference, I did answer Arnaud's question about the governance in my comments here: 
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:13:40 GMT):<br/>
The Besu maintainer google doc appears to be all one company plus one maintainer from Web3Labs.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:13:40 GMT):<br/>
The Besu maintainer google doc appears to be all one company (PegaSys) plus one maintainer from Web3Labs.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:13:44 GMT):<br/>
Is this still accurate?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:13:46 GMT):<br/>
I think @grace.hartley had the floor.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:14:03 GMT):<br/>
I also think it's pretty rude to just take it away from her.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:16:23 GMT):<br/>
"The project is not highly dependent on any single contributor (there are at least 3 legally independent committers and there is no single company or entity that is vital to the success of the project)"
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:17:32 GMT):<br/>
This is true of Sawtooth
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:17:48 GMT):<br/>
In the Google Doc, I count 19/20 maintainers from PegaSys.

Unsaid on lack of diversity in contributors and maintainers in Hyperledger projects is near complete focus on backend technologies. That goes hand in glove with lack of adoption of HLP in prod. Posit addressing resilient secure front-end app technologies will change the diversity.

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:18:43 GMT):<br/>
Maybe we should fully define "The project must have an active and diverse set of contributing members representing various constituencies."   
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:19:09 GMT):<br/>
I can reconfirm this
</p>
<p><strong>grace.hartley</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:19:14 GMT):<br/>
Sorry for the slow response, @troyronda! Yes, you are correct about the maintainer list. that is still correct with the 19 of 20.
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:19:28 GMT):<br/>
ETC Cooperative are committed to maintaining Besu
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:19:42 GMT):<br/>
Whatever happens with PegaSys
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:19:45 GMT):<br/>
There is no one from ETC Cooperative currently in the maintainer list?
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:19:56 GMT):<br/>
No.
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:20:21 GMT):<br/>
But the reason for this is that ChainSafe have done most of the work on behalf of ETC Cooperative.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:20:39 GMT):<br/>
This feels like goalpost moving.
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:20:47 GMT):<br/>
I understand that Greg Koufou of ChainSafe is going through the process of becoming an official maintainer.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:21:28 GMT):<br/>
These are all good progress points.  In our experience in Indy and Aries, making the build system work for folks outside the majority contributor's company also took a lot of work.  Perhaps status  build/test/release process and its community friendliness would support the story?
</p>
<p><strong>grace.hartley</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:21:35 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda here is more information on our maintainer process. https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2019/11/07/best-practices-and-lessons-learned-from-hyperledger-besu-establishing-a-maintainer-process
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:22:08 GMT):<br/>
ETC Cooperative have funding and we have engineers, but those engineers would usually NOT be the ones doing ETC work on Besu.
Instead we are likely to fund that work.   Usually through ChainSafe.   But maybe from other vendors.   Or maybe ourselves.
But usually through contractors.
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:22:59 GMT):<br/>
I asked Nik to join this call because he need to apply for status but was UNCLEAR on what is required
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:23:18 GMT):<br/>
@nfrunza ^^
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:23:41 GMT):<br/>
maintainers or percentage of code? 
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:23:58 GMT):<br/>
what about past projects? 
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:24:31 GMT):<br/>
We need to update the documentation for sure.....
</p>
<p><strong>nfrunza</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:24:42 GMT):<br/>
@Silona thank you, Yes indeed we want to move forward to active status. We have contributors from DTCC, Fujitsu, Tecnalia, Altoros, and some other companies
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:24:46 GMT):<br/>
I have a 23-year career as a professional software engineer.
My colleague, Yaz Khoury, is also an engineer.
But on Besu in particular, it is likely that we would contract that work, because it is specialist, and because we have other projects which we are "hands-on" ourselves.
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:25:27 GMT):<br/>
Yaz and I *could* do that work, but practically it makes no sense for the two of us to be maintainers.
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:25:27 GMT):<br/>
Ed would be great as a maintainer, yes.
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:25:54 GMT):<br/>
@nfrunza do you understand the differences btn number of Maintainers and % code contributed? ecause I think that impacts you greatly
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:27:05 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the link Grace!
</p>
<p><strong>nfrunza</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:27:37 GMT):<br/>
@Silona there are statistics provided by the GitHub, but they rely on the master branch, and contributors usually contribute to brances 
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:29:31 GMT):<br/>
It's this line again:  "The project must have an active and diverse set of contributing members representing various constituencies."
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:29:41 GMT):<br/>
It doesn't say anything formal, and is seemingly up for interpretation.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:30:11 GMT):<br/>
I usually think of the term committer as referring to someone with write access to a repo (aka a maintainer).
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:31:36 GMT):<br/>
This project was open source before it came to Hyperledger, no, @grace.hartley ?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:31:36 GMT):<br/>
This project was open source before it came to Hyperledger, yes, @grace.hartley ?
</p>
<p><strong>grace.hartley</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:31:47 GMT):<br/>
Yes, it was open source before Hyperledger.
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:31:57 GMT):<br/>
And I have to admit - I took that as meaning %contributed code
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:32:15 GMT):<br/>
@mwagner ^^
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:32:28 GMT):<br/>
For example IBM has a high percentage of contributed code not in regards to maintainers
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:33:14 GMT):<br/>
I've said before that I don't really love the binary active/incubation status--it's just a bit that seemingly depends on what the TSC is thinking on any particular day.  It doesn't really matter much except for marketing and informing potential users about the long-term viability of projects.  But wouldn't just displaying useful contribution statistics (i.e. maintainers/contributors/code by company) accomplish the same thing?  
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:34:18 GMT):<br/>
contributors like bob are significant but not really a maintainer because of the modularity of the code they are submitting
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:34:20 GMT):<br/>
If it were possible to determine company affiliations from github, this might be totally moot.
</p>
<p><strong>grace.hartley</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:34:26 GMT):<br/>
Besu's quarterly report is scheduled for December 5th
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:35:22 GMT):<br/>
workin on it...
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:35:23 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, we have had this style of discussion for all projects that have made it to active status, and they all have involved pretty heavy discussion.  I wouldn't say this is unique for Besu--some have been much more contentious.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:35:41 GMT):<br/>
:thumbsup: 
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:35:42 GMT):<br/>
For my feeling, I think the Besu team is acting in good faith and doing good work towards growing their community.  I have some questions about where they are from a tools and community support perspective, not on whether they have them, but whether they are PegaSys team independent.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:36:06 GMT):<br/>
very good, thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>cliveb</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:36:25 GMT):<br/>
As Google has shown with ML and tensorflow adoption. The diversity is in a community of app developers with backend core technologies contributed and mostly maintained by Goog. https://developers.google.com/community 
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:37:05 GMT):<br/>
The docs they are creating for the community are really good.  and with their class you can get besu up and running quickly  (i took it)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:37:30 GMT):<br/>
Why is Besu being punished for the sins of other projects?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:37:51 GMT):<br/>
To be fair, the diversity aspect can also be gamed.  I can work for whoever I want to when I announce my identity on github!
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:38:12 GMT):<br/>
yes, like many other things
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:38:29 GMT):<br/>
the way we are moving forward is to tie it to the LFID... but moving VERY SLOWLY.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:38:32 GMT):<br/>
that's really uncalled for
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:39:05 GMT):<br/>
I didn't hear anyone saying they want to punish Besu or any other project
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:39:08 GMT):<br/>
ed has teh requeiste 5 commits and I was going to propose it after thanksgiving to give proper exposure.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:39:57 GMT):<br/>
I feel that the spirit of the objective is summed up by "there is no single company or entity that is vital to the success of the project".
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:41:14 GMT):<br/>
Or perhaps "there is no single company or entity whose withdrawl would kill the project" -- if the primary maintainers left they would be missed but the project wouldn't have to be retired
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:41:32 GMT):<br/>
Agree.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:42:03 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure how I can evaluate this objective right now for Besu?
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:42:17 GMT):<br/>
"There is no single company or entity whose withdrawal would kill the project"

PegaSys withdrawal would NOT kill the project.

<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:43:30 GMT):<br/>
It sounds to me that the criteria for active status need a lot more work.
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:44:08 GMT):<br/>
I personally agree that it is likely too early.
But the poor criteria have wasted a lot of people's time.

@Silona thank you, do we take in consideration demand of the project? how active is the community in Rocket chat channels?  
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:52:25 GMT):<br/>
@Silona I commented on this on the explorer doc--we haven't done a 1.0 for a non-security related tool yet.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:53:11 GMT):<br/>
@Silona The best way to get something done in Hyperledger is to write something that makes a lot of people angry, then make them edit it until they are happy ;)
</p>
<p><strong>nfrunza</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:53:18 GMT):<br/>
@hartm I'm somehow confused about the "non-security" related tool
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:53:44 GMT):<br/>
@nfrunza We require most projects to undergo a security audit for 1.0.  That would be silly for Explorer.
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:54:35 GMT):<br/>
That seems to be the demotivating trend?
</p>
<p><strong>nfrunza</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:54:43 GMT):<br/>
@hartm we have audits in the past, and any security vulnerability is raised we are fixing within time range
</p>

@hartm is there a small subset of explorer that may still have security impacts? I do not know this project, but I was curious about https://github.com/hyperledger/blockchain-explorer/blob/master/README.md#Authorization-Configuration

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:57:45 GMT):<br/>
Maybe there is now?  I haven't looked in a while.  I still would expect it to be much less in-depth than a core DLT review.

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 16:17:16 GMT):<br/>
It feels very punitive to me, as an outsider.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 16:18:07 GMT):<br/>
and how is that a punishment?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 16:22:16 GMT):<br/>
I agree with @lehors that it isn't intended as punishment, but it often feels that way to the project that is waiting on an answer.  The problems being raised are ones of ambiguity and not specific to their situation.  This pattern happened with Accord, the performance and scale group, Caliper and perhaps other times as well.  A clear no is often more helpful than ongoing discussion without any clear way to affect getting to any decision.  My hope is that we can at least give an answer like "we have to fix X, then ask again".

<p><strong>nfrunza</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 16:23:33 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 18:56:04 GMT):<br/>
@nfrunza Beyond DLT security, I also assume GUI or API authn/authz or some forms of user-entered input (etc...) could be reviewable.
(I was just taking a very quick glance at the README.)
</p>
<p><strong>nfrunza</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 19:03:48 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda I agree with you, it may need to be reviewed, thank you as of now we do not have roles for the explorer, anyone knowing the fabric crypto acts as an admin. 
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 22:48:04 GMT):<br/>
I believe when it got moved over to github is is also now getting scanned by the automated security tools in GH.  which helps with GUI related input.  can y'all confirm? @dhuseby @rjones 
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 22:48:28 GMT):<br/>
but that doesn't address everything obviously
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 23:48:15 GMT):<br/>
the automated scanning is for dependencies with CVEs.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 23:52:43 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 09:25:32 GMT):<br/>
Has there been any consideration of establishing a liaison relationship with ISO TC 307?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 09:35:46 GMT):<br/>
Not officially. Some of us have unofficially liaised through participation in both organizations.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 11:15:55 GMT):<br/>
Any reason to not officially establish a liaison relationship?
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 11:48:36 GMT):<br/>
Any reason to not officially establish a liaison relationship?  Seems as though there would be a lot of value to both Hyperledger and ISO.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 15:17:17 GMT):<br/>
I honestly can't remember whether we officially discussed it but I'm pretty sure the topic has come up before. I think the challenge would be to figure out who would be representing hyperledger.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 15:17:53 GMT):<br/>
maybe @bbehlendorf knows more about this
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 15:44:58 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Sat, 23 Nov 2019 13:45:46 GMT):<br/>
I only bring it up as it would make sense to make sure Hyperledger projects are inline with the ISO standards that are being developed, and without Hyperledger participating in those standards, they may end up conflicting.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sat, 23 Nov 2019 18:56:56 GMT):<br/>
Sure. What I was getting at is that Hyperledger and EEA have associate memberships in each other, but it's unclear to me who from Hyperledger can participate at what level at EEA.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Sat, 23 Nov 2019 19:47:07 GMT):<br/>
IBM for one is participating in TC307 with the main goal of ensuring whatever they produce doesn't conflict with what we are doing at Hyperledger

<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:10:49 GMT):<br/>
This doesn't seem like we're ready to have this conversation right now.  Let's do some research and discuss online
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:11:24 GMT):<br/>
switching chat platforms is a much bigger issue than streamlining the LFID process or fixing a bug with anon access
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:12:48 GMT):<br/>
@rjones "but it's unclear to me who from Hyperledger can participate at what level at EEA."    My understanding is that the associate membership agreement for EEA applies ONLY to Hyperledger staff and "officials" - so probably all the TSC members can get access.    But specifically HL members do not get inside the EEA paywall because of it.   Which makes it pretty "meh", IMHO.
</p>
<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:13:44 GMT):<br/>
Essentially, an particular company needs to be a member of both EEA and Hyperledger to be able to usefully bridge the mapping of EEA specs onto Hyperledger code bases.

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:24:10 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 agreed: people do think Hyperledger ships products, not projects.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:24:38 GMT):<br/>
Open source projects do ship products.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:24:55 GMT):<br/>
Companies may create derivative works of those products to make their own products too
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:25:09 GMT):<br/>
these are not products
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:25:13 GMT):<br/>
they are projects
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:25:37 GMT):<br/>
I won't vent here ... but I think it's a problem
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:26:17 GMT):<br/>
If Hyperledger PAID for developers, might be different
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:26:23 GMT):<br/>
But HL does not 
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:26:25 GMT):<br/>
This probably requires a longer conversation to make sure we're using the word "product" similarly.  For example, it may include an expectation of support, and that may be where end-users can get confused
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:26:38 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:33:04 GMT):<br/>
The rules never say "three MAINTAINERS."  Just contributors.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:33:23 GMT):<br/>
@rjones I knew someone would say that....
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:33:25 GMT):<br/>
It probably should say maintainers.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:35:04 GMT):<br/>
I think active contributors naturally migrate to maintainers, though, in a healthy project?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:35:22 GMT):<br/>
Right now active status is required for a 1.0 release.  That's really the only carrot right now.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:35:38 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 would Fabric and Sawtooth be willing to remove active status?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:36:33 GMT):<br/>
Is part of the concern the length of time spent in incubation to see how the project community evolves?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:36:36 GMT):<br/>
Regardless of what people think of my proposal, I think it's pretty universal that we should have better community support metrics publicly available.  Can we do something to ensure this happens?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:37:02 GMT):<br/>
well I'd rather have people writing code .... maintainers are not always the people writing code.
and HL has admin rights to the repos .... so if maintainers bail, HL admin(s) can always add someone else  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:38:16 GMT):<br/>
but if there's no one to maintain (write / fix ) the code, that's an issue
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:38:54 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:42:14 GMT):<br/>
If we had good community metrics tools, it would be very easy to continually check whether communities were active...
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:42:40 GMT):<br/>
I disagree with the point that we shouldn't periodically check on communities.  They change.  We need to make sure they're still good.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:42:43 GMT):<br/>
we've got the contributor scripts
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:43:11 GMT):<br/>
@Dan As I said in the email, I'd like to see more detailed metrics than that, and have them made public.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:43:42 GMT):<br/>
Do you see that in other oss projects?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:43:54 GMT):<br/>
No.  But I would like to!
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:44:41 GMT):<br/>
One thing I do when I'm evaluating another oss project is just look at the github contributors page. you get a pretty visceral sense of whether there's many contributing and how frequently they are contributing.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:45:54 GMT):<br/>
I do that too.  But it doesn't list people by company unless they use their company emails (which isn't very common), and it's hard to eyeball if there are a lot of contributors.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:50:22 GMT):<br/>
I would really like to get to the DCO topic today
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:51:34 GMT):<br/>
you're a dreamer  ;)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:51:50 GMT):<br/>
yeah I know.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:58:17 GMT):<br/>
People change jobs, too.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 15:59:29 GMT):<br/>
This DCO stuff feels like a policy and mechanisms the Linux Foundation could provide. That's one of the reasons companies come to the LF to setup governance on these kinds of oss projects.

<p><strong>bobsummerwill</strong> (Thu, 05 Dec 2019 21:27:51 GMT):<br/>
@lehors @cbf The question of liaison with TC307 is something which I raised in 2017 with me EEA hat on.

At the time I noted that the ISO groups existed, but had no idea who was participating in those groups or what they were saying.    And noted the rather horrifying prospect of BAD STANDARDS being pushed into ISO by people who were not actively involved in building real world enterprise blockchain solutions (ie. participants in EEA, Hyperledger and R3).

From the EEA side, I don't think anybody did anything about that, and I was out of the EEA from October 2017 onwards.

I met with Walid AL-SAQAF of the Internet Society in March 2017 to talk about some of these issues.   How should the EEA and Hyperledger interact with:

- IEEE
- IETF
- ISO
- ITU
- ICANN

I still don't think we have answers, but something I know for sure is that we need to be having the conversations.   That was true then in 2017 and it is most certainly the case in 2019.

I'm totally fine being persuaded that removing active/incubation status is a bad idea.  However, I'd prefer these suggestions offer a constructive way to handle the community diversity requirement.  What we have today seems really confusing and arbitrary.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 15:39:10 GMT):<br/>
I still thinks there needs to be some diversity requirement so that projects demonstrate community building.

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 15:44:38 GMT):<br/>
Can we give some examples of what it means to be "dominated" by one employer?  I'm not sure where we want to draw the line, and I think this would be very useful for projects that want to propose active status.

On sept 25 they changed it and created a bit of a loop that you have to be active to do a major release
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 15:53:19 GMT):<br/>
or sept 24th?

We do endorse things that are “releases” and expect certain criteria to be met by them: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/releases
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 16:00:13 GMT):<br/>
I think (maybe Hart) also captured that in one of the earlier threads (the defn of First Major Release). All part of let's just get those docs sorted out before we create more process related agenda topics.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 16:02:41 GMT):<br/>
I would say that the word "release" in "first major release" is more the issue. We probably need to change this completely to "project marketing announcement" or some such.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 16:06:14 GMT):<br/>
The question is whether each project has the same criteria for a release. Should https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Release+Taxonomy be expanded to cover that criteria?
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 16:09:40 GMT):<br/>
DLT vs tools vs libraries are all very different release criteria wise
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 16:14:06 GMT):<br/>
Maybe. If you look at https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/fabric/Release+Exit+Criteria, there are a number of items in here that could pertain to any sort of project:
1. all of the agreed supported features are complete
2. features should comprise in total a meaningful set of functionality
3. adequate test coverage (unit and functional/integration) to have confidence that there aren't likely to be any gotchas lurking in the untested code,
4. maintainers have reviewed all remaining open bugs and agree on severity/priority,
5. zero high or highest priority bugs remain open,
6. the preceding release candidate will have been published for a minimum of two weeks
7. no bugs that affect security of the system remain open unless they have mitigating workarounds published in release notes,
8. that there have been security scans (static and dynamic), code audit and penetration testing with all significant findings reported in JIRA (major releases only),
9. code included in the release has been scanned for license infringements and no infringements have been found,
10. crypto code included in the release has been audited for crypto export compliance,
11. release has met all the criteria for CII Best Practices Badge Best Practices Badge,
12. documentation sufficient to ensure that users/operators have clear guidance on how to get started and how to configure and operate. The operational aspects need to be correct and independently user tested,
13. any features that we choose not to support, because there is risk or they are incomplete, need to have a build tag or runtime feature flag to disable said feature and clear guidance as to the risks attendant to enabling it,

</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 16:14:32 GMT):<br/>
These are all generic enough that they would apply to any of the projects within Hyperledger.
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 16:15:30 GMT):<br/>
There is no place to go to in Hyperledger to actually download / obtain releases ... we have no definition of what release artifacts are
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 12 Dec 2019 16:16:06 GMT):<br/>

This is how EEA does most of their specs.  Occasionally skipping the 90% in wiki step and going straight to github for some specs.  Many of the meeting agendas are basically lists of github issues and github pull requests, all referenced by pull/issue number, so it is explicit as to what was agreed on.  Then you can say "Section II B 3 was edited by PR #34, and here's the contextual discussion in the PR thread"

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 19 Dec 2019 15:38:48 GMT):<br/>
Can we also get some clarity as to HL marketing efforts regarding projects?  Apache, for instance, has very strict requirements around marketing for projects in incubation.  HL doesn't have these, and we seem to market things that aren't active.

I think "promoted release" means promoted by Hyperledger here.  You're obviously entitled to promote your own stuff!

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 15:22:28 GMT):<br/>
I'm not worried about blogs.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 15:22:59 GMT):<br/>
Dan is right--the "promoted release" stuff should correspond to the expensive stuff.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 15:24:40 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 15:24:51 GMT):<br/>
+1 to Tracy.  It's important to get documentation correct.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 15:27:18 GMT):<br/>
The fact that we can't immediately come up with what promoted means indicates that we should define it in the documentation.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 15:28:45 GMT):<br/>
Re Chris:  if you look at the Apache guidelines (which ours are based upon) there are very restrictive guidelines for promoting incubated "podlings" in Apache, much more than we have for incubated projects in Hyperledger.

<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 17:10:45 GMT):<br/>
Do you have a link?  I see much on becoming a top project but they are more concerned with concrete documentation and licenses. http://incubator.apache.org/
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 18:17:27 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, if you dig through the Apache documentation, it looks very similar to Hyeprledger (unfortunately they also have the problem that we do of documentation being very decentralized and hard to find).
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 18:18:13 GMT):<br/>
That being said, we are way less restrictive than Apache is on incubated projects.  If I recall correctly, "podlings"--Apache's term for incubated projects--cannot even use the Apache name except under special circumstances.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 18:18:55 GMT):<br/>
Brian is definitely the person to ask about this.  I've never personally worked in an Apache project, so I don't know how things work in practice.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 18:22:11 GMT):<br/>
From https://incubator.apache.org/guides/graduation.html:
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 18:22:25 GMT):<br/>
The project is considered to have a diverse community when it is not highly dependent on any single contributor (there are at least 3 legally independent committers and there is no single company or entity that is vital to the success of the project). Basically this means that when a project mostly consists of contributors from one company, this is a sign of not being diverse enough. You can mitigate this requirement by admitting more external contributors to your project that have no tie to the single entity.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 18:22:32 GMT):<br/>
This is almost our text verbatim.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 21:12:48 GMT):<br/>
Will the common repo structure task force be starting up anytime soon?  I was hoping for some standard Code of Conduct boilerplate to update the Besu CoC so I only had to harass the maintainers for a sign off once.  Will that come in the near term or should I just plan on running a CoC PR with broad maintainer buy in twice?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 21:16:29 GMT):<br/>
Hi Danno, I made a recommendation in the wiki, and should probably post to the mailing list as well. Basically, that the repolinter tool that Ry suggested seems to tick all the right boxes if we tweak the policy slightly

<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Mon, 27 Jan 2020 13:29:49 GMT):<br/>
But we're not in Apache: we're in Linux Foundation.  LF CII already defines diversity criteria for a Gold badge as follows:

"""
Continuity

The project MUST have at least two unassociated significant contributors. [contributors_unassociated]

Details: Contributors are associated if they are paid to work by the same organization (as an employee or contractor) and the organization stands to benefit from the project's results. Financial grants do not count as being from the same organization if they pass through other organizations (e.g., science grants paid to different organizations from a common government or NGO source do not cause contributors to be associated). Someone is a significant contributor if they have made non-trivial contributions to the project in the past year. Examples of good indicators of a significant contributor are: written at least 1,000 lines of code, contributed 50 commits, or contributed at least 20 pages of documentation.

Rationale: This reduces the risk of non-support if a single organization stops supporting the project as FLOSS. It also reduces the risk of malicious code insertion, since there is more independence between contributors. This covers the case where "two people work for company X, but only one is paid to work on this project" (because the non-paid person could still have many of the same incentives). It also covers the case where "two people got paid working for Red Cross for a day, but Red Cross doesn't use the project".
"""

We might quibble over whether 2 is enough, and whether continuity is the only reason for requiring diversity, but sure it makes sense to inherit this rather than invent something new nad slightly different from a completely different organisation?

The Linux Foundation’s CommunityBridge engineers are working on a tool to measure the health of critical open source projects and one of the key areas identified is QA Testing.  They request that our communities provide  honest and detailed information on testing tools and methodologies you use in your projects for us to come up with a detailed analysis, which they will share with all respondents and projects. https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/9H5G2GV. It’s only 5 questions long.

Would like to know if it is ok to ask for a YourKit open source free license for Besu (https://www.yourkit.com/purchase/#os_license) ? The only thing we have to do is to update the README and add a reference to their website.

The biggest issue for me with respect to the mentorship program is that it seems to require a summer of work (essentially an internship) but the stipend isn't remotely competitive with a Silicon Valley internship salary.  It'd be difficult for me to convince a lot of people to try for something like this due to that reason.

<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 15:16:15 GMT):<br/>
@mastersingh24 so are you saying that you need a reminder from @Dan ?
</p>
<p><strong>mastersingh24</strong> (Thu, 30 Jan 2020 15:18:33 GMT):<br/>

That would be the same to me. Just different words. There's some kind of release that requires approval.

@hartm Thanks for bringing up the stipend issue. Our stipends are comparable to other open source project stipends and it's in line with other projects hosted at the Linux Foundation. Besides stipends, we provide travel funding to send mentees to attend a Hyperledger event to network, professionalize in addition to meeting each other and their mentors in person.

Dan was saying that requiring many files would lead to "clutter"
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 15:35:33 GMT):<br/>
I do think maintainers should be following the TSC mailing list and changes to the TSC wiki space, to watch for things that may affect their project, rather than the TSC having to remember to remind them to pay attention to relevant issues
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 15:35:48 GMT):<br/>
There are some files that are needed and it should not be up to the maintainers alone,  I do agree that bringing the maintainers along is important

Mentioning that expectation the quarterly report reminders, perhaps.

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 15:55:54 GMT):<br/>
To further expand on my comment, I expect that once we hear back from the lawyers, we will need to base contributing privileges on the LFID.  In other words, you'll need valid LFID with attached signed forms (for things like patent release) to contribute.  If we have such a system where the LFID is the root of everything, then it should be very easy to find contributors and make sure everyone is accounted for.    
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 15:56:54 GMT):<br/>
@rjones that's a separate issue and I think orthogonal... frankly, I think there's a missing component of responsibility on the part of people to self identify

<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 15:58:59 GMT):<br/>
So long as we accept contributions via forums that are not limited to LFID-badged tooling (the only way to really get working email addresses ) then no, the DCO thing won't really affect this

</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 16:06:38 GMT):<br/>
Things are changing tooling wise.  My team has to stay on top of this and reflect it properly to the LF.  Please understand that much of this is difficult to give to them as software requirements. 
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 16:06:39 GMT):<br/>
Who is eligible is one of the questions. If it is just github, the community tools work well. What about the wiki and other contributions. 
The next is participation rates: we need to have an active campaign to increase these. Both of these need to be addressed

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 16:28:35 GMT):<br/>
If an LFID is required to submit a PR I would expect this to negatively affect Besu.  I think LFID is fine for maintainers.  It raises the barrier for casual contributions and that is the on-ramp to regular contributions.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 16:48:52 GMT):<br/>
I don't think we could do that, since it's unlikely GitHub will accept LFID SAML any time soon.
</p>
<p><strong>toddinpal</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 18:19:53 GMT):<br/>
Is it just me (probably so) but is the TSC a misnomer?  What technical issues does or has the TSC addressed?  It seems far more consumed with policy and governance than any sort of technical issues.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 18:35:43 GMT):<br/>
It steers the technical community, and its governance decisions are intended, long term, to lead to optimal technical outcomes. Also, there are some types of decisions much more technical than others - decisions about accepting a new project, for instance, where scrutinizing the technology is a key part.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 18:36:27 GMT):<br/>
election issues are meta and ideally minimized to spend more time on more technical issues.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 18:42:19 GMT):<br/>
Fair enough. The LFID signup process has improved but could improve further (and we're told it will).  But to ask this the other way - will those casual contributors be discouraged from contributing if, for lack of an LFID, they aren't given a vote in the TSC election?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 18:43:38 GMT):<br/>
requiring a LFID to cast a ballot seems like a reasonable step.  I think the casual contributors who won't LFID to submit a PR are very unlikely to vote or care about the outcome untill they are onboarded to becoming a regular commiter.

</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 18:43:40 GMT):<br/>
It would be possible to automate a process that looks at the PR, determines whether all associated Github accounts correspond to an LFID account in good standing, and flag if it doesn't as something the maintainer should not accept. As one possibility. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 18:43:54 GMT):<br/>
true
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 18:46:06 GMT):<br/>
We get "drive by" commits to address obscure build issues and to update named network boot nodes.  I don't want to add friction to those contributions.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 18:49:20 GMT):<br/>
Right - so one proposal could be to allow anyone to contribute (they still need to sign their commits with a CLA of course, and it's on the maintainers to have confidence in who they are) and not insert an LFID creation step in submitting such a response, or needing to log into an LFID-based system, but those contributors without associated LFIDs would not get a right to a vote.  Just a proposal, but that seems to strike a balance and significantly improve the elector process.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 06 Feb 2020 18:51:51 GMT):<br/>
If they can do "eletion day registration" by getting an LFID and associating it with a prior contribution it satisfies my concern.

Which I have done...
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 07 Feb 2020 02:46:05 GMT):<br/>
While I agree that requiring an LFID increases friction for a first contribution, I'm betting it's something that will be required by legal after the DCO stuff gets reviewed.  As it stands right now, I could anonymously contribute something that I had a patent on and then turn around and try to sue the LF (or, something like this).  As I understand, it would be very murky legally since who contributed the patented code couldn't be traded.  While a per-commit CLA approach might work, I'm guessing this won't be any less cumbersome than signing up for an LFID (which would presumably include signing the CLA).  
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 07 Feb 2020 02:47:01 GMT):<br/>
Unfortunately, I am worried that we might get tied down here by legal requirements.  I'm not sure how we can best satisfy DCO requirements without making "drive-by" contributions more cumbersome.  Any thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 07 Feb 2020 02:48:37 GMT):<br/>
Yep!  Brian is suggesting what I basically had in mind.  We could have a whitelist of github accounts, essentially.

I like Danno's suggestion. Not sure I'd take it to the extreme of election-day registration, but certainly could help resolve the un-crossreferenced commits in the list.

Is a sponsor required to be *both* a maintainer *and* a TSC member, or can it be *either* a maintainer *or* a TSC member?

We need to have a long discussion to determine the election process, obviously.  Then we can decide that that process needs observers too!  But then if we get more than 2 volunteers, how will we elect them?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 13 Feb 2020 15:46:38 GMT):<br/>
I've got an idea. We could have an election for the observers of the observers of the election to elect the observers for the election!

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 15:44:40 GMT):<br/>
Is signing up for an LFID really that much friction?  Rebasing your commits to deal with the signing issue seems like something that's more annoying than signing up for an LFID.
</p>
<p><strong>silasdavis</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 15:46:38 GMT):<br/>
There is a very limited way that DCO protects us from malintent; in the case of a first party insertion of patented code. It cannot protect from someone else inserting copyrighted code. Also adding a layer of indirection to, say LFID, doesn't practically add any more protection without doing serious KYCing which LF does not do anyway. So it is preferable to have the most minimal form of legal arse-covering we can get away with IMO
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 15:48:18 GMT):<br/>
I'm betting that LF legal will want us to do at least some light KYCing.  Enabling anonymous contributions (at least, anonymous from the perspective of the LF) seems dangerous from a legal perspective (I'm obviously not a lawyer though).
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 15:57:51 GMT):<br/>
Solang seems great from a technical perspective.  The question for the TSC is whether we want to accept very small projects (in terms of contributors) for project incubation.  To my knowledge, we have never approved a project for incubation without initial contributors from two different companies.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 15:59:32 GMT):<br/>
Regarding LFID, any service that requires me to signup for an ID before doing the thing I actually want to do is a problem for me.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 16:02:41 GMT):<br/>
I'm going to argue that a notification that says "sign up for an LFID before your code can be merged" is lower friction than something like "navigate through the labyrinthine wiki to find out you need to sign off your commits so your PRs aren't rejected" which is what happens currently.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 16:18:08 GMT):<br/>
well if we could pop up a notification that says "use `git commit -s`" that would be the same.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 16:19:02 GMT):<br/>
really that should be clearly written in the contributing.md file which will have other requirements that maintainers need before they accept a patch.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 16:24:02 GMT):<br/>
We do discuss DCO in our contributing and point them to a wiki giving them all the details.  And when our DCO check finds errors we given them cut and paste instructions on how to do it, and even chat support.  They still walk away on occasion.  There are some contributors who won't touch the terminal when it comes to git commands.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 17:58:10 GMT):<br/>
@Dan I agree, but, from a legal perspective, we are probably much better covered by "sign up for an LFID".  I would love for us to live in a world where we could all contribute seamlessly and anonymously, but alas, that doesn't seem to be the case.  And the real problem (at least from what I've seen) is people forgetting or not knowing to use -s and having to rebase commits.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 20 Feb 2020 17:59:25 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon That's great practice for onboarding contributors.  More of us should be doing stuff like that.  And yes, you're right--some people walk away when you have to use a terminal.  But presumably using an LFID would eliminate the terminal use for minor commits, which is a bonus in my opinion.

On the ethereum problem of maintaining contract state, note that Substrate charges rent for contract storage. 
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 16:21:15 GMT):<br/>
On the discussion of webassembly and the host functions, here are the host functions of a few DLTs:

https://github.com/ewasm/design
https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sabre/blob/master/tp/src/wasm_executor/wasm_externals.rs
https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-chaincode-wasm
https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/frame/contracts/src/wasm/runtime.rs#L503

You can see there are very different approaches in the details, however broadly they all provide the same functionality.

State rent was investigated on Eth mainnet but has been set a side for "stateless ethereum" research.  Rent is a good solution but exceedingly hard to bring in 4 years after launch.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 16:34:46 GMT):<br/>
But a standard set of host functions that smart contracts can use to interact with DLT hosts I think is a target of opportunity HLP should examine.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 16:50:43 GMT):<br/>
I think this is a great opportunity. The ewasm host functions are very ethereum centric (storage values are always 32 bytes for example, not great for string). 
As I understand it, the Fabric wasm chain code is not stable yet. That might be a great opportunity to design, and implement a  new standard set. I'm sure Burrow will be on board too. 
Any such standard would need to deal with DLTs that do not provide functionality, e.g. no block height on sawtooth.
@swetha @amundson any insights would be appreciated. Thanks!

@dhuseby you asked if wasm can have side-channel attacks. Now meltdown and spectre require access to a high-resolution timer, which is not true for smart contracts. You have access to the block time, but that does not change the duration of the smart contract execution.
I'm not sure what other side channel attacks are possible. I'll ask my friend Ben Gras, who works for intel. He's written several papers on the subject. https://download.vusec.net/papers/anc_ndss17.pdf

I'm not sure what other side channel attacks are possible. I'll ask my friend Ben Gras, who works for intel. He's written several papers on the subject. https://download.vusec.net/papers/anc_ndss17.pdf
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 19:38:30 GMT):<br/>
Interestingly if a side channel attack is found, that would make the smart contract execution non-deterministic which would cause problems on DLTs. 
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 19:47:05 GMT):<br/>
wasm multithreading is a terrible idea for smart contracts.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 23:43:42 GMT):<br/>
@seanyoung I was asking if the WASM code could be attacked by an attacker on the same system using a side-channel analysis method to extract private keys from WASM code doing crypto.
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 23:43:47 GMT):<br/>
 @seanyoung so what are the performance implications of not multithreading ?  are limited to single execution?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 23:44:09 GMT):<br/>
the only way to defend against that kind of thing is to make sure the crypto code you write/use does equal-cost-multi-path branching.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 23:44:52 GMT):<br/>
if you implement crypto in Rust and compile it to WASM and then it gets JIT'd, there it is almost certainly not going to be resistant to side-channel attacks
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 23:44:52 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 23:45:34 GMT):<br/>
if you're doing any encryption using code written that way, attackers just have to be on the same system, not in the same process, to be able to extract your private keys eventually.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 23:47:16 GMT):<br/>
the only way to fix this would be to externalize the crypto to a library that is resistant to side channel attacks. it likely won't be written in a way that is so easily portable across systems as WASM
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 23:47:27 GMT):<br/>
the takeaway is, do not do crypto in WASM
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 27 Feb 2020 23:48:03 GMT):<br/>
in browsers--even the ones moving to WASM--they externalize the actual crypto operations to known-good libraries such as OpenSSL or NaCl
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 00:01:06 GMT):<br/>
I don't think you would want to do signing crypto in a smart contract any way, only verifications.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 02:32:35 GMT):<br/>
@dhuseby the cache side channel attacks all depend on a high resolution timer. How do you think can be achieved?
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 02:32:35 GMT):<br/>
@dhuseby the cache side channel attacks all depend on a high resolution timer. How do you think a side channel attack can be made without one?
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 02:42:53 GMT):<br/>
current smart contracts are single threaded. There are proposals for multi threading in wasm. We would need to look closely at that before allowing it in smart contracts.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 03:10:23 GMT):<br/>
exactly. everything executed on-chain does not have private keys
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:41:42 GMT):<br/>
Yep!  There's not any good way to do this without revealing the key.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:43:00 GMT):<br/>
It's been shown you can do side channel attacks remotely.  Here's the original paper:  https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/ssl-timing.pdf.  Here's a more modern side channel timing attack that affects cryptocurrencies: https://crypto.stanford.edu/timings/paper.pdf.  That one is remote too.   
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 07:42:44 GMT):<br/>
The second paper uses monitoring on a users wallet.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 07:44:07 GMT):<br/>
the inputs, outputs and execution code of smart contracts are known to everyone on the chain. You don't need "side channels" to know what's going on.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 07:44:45 GMT):<br/>
So, having dismissed that possibility, I was talking about using smart contracts to side channel into the validator nodes. 
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 07:46:45 GMT):<br/>
So I was talking about using malicious wasm contracts to extract private key information from validator nodes. That would require a high resolution timer.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 07:46:45 GMT):<br/>
So I was talking about using malicious wasm contracts to extract private key information from validator nodes. That would require a high resolution timer available to the wasm smart contracts, which there is not (and should never be).
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 08:35:07 GMT):<br/>
Yes, if there are no secrets on smart contracts, then there are no opportunities for side channels on smart contracts.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 08:38:46 GMT):<br/>
I guess you could, in theory anyway, have a smart contract that communicated to the network based on validator input/output and could attempt a timing attack this way.  This would seem practically difficult though (the first paper did a similar thing for OpenSSL way back in the day--with enough samples you could average out the network noise).
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 09:48:11 GMT):<br/>
That would be one way, in theory. I was more thinking of something using cpu cache attacks, like this one: https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~genkin/papers/drive-by.pdf
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 09:51:14 GMT):<br/>
there a few of these attacks, however they all depend on a good timing source (like the tsc register on x86 :smile: )
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 09:51:14 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 10:11:01 GMT):<br/>
Here is another that shows that the "equal-cost-multi-path branching" is not an effective defense.  However it does need a timing source. https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/806.pdf
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 15:32:55 GMT):<br/>
One mitigation would be to execute the smart contract first on a non-signing node and have the signing node either accept the executors results or re-run it and check the results.  The attack contract would need to be non-deterministic to extract different values based on cache results so a second execution would show changes, and it  would also be dependant on the specific JIT or impl of interpreter.  This mitigates exfultration of the key on-chain.  To keep off chain exfiltration I would sandbox contracts away to prohibit use of network code as a matter of course, but there is still the possiblity of using host functions as a way to get it out.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:25:24 GMT):<br/>
So smart contracts should be deterministic and never have access to network code or anything with side effects other than contract storage and emitting events.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:25:47 GMT):<br/>
This is probably a dumb question, but I'll ask anyways since I've waded into a discussion of Ethereum experts discussing side channel attacks:  why is it clearly not possible to somehow exploit gas costs on Ethereum for side channel attacks?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:27:01 GMT):<br/>
Deterministic execution is one smart contract model, EOS doesn't have that as it uses a wall clock to ensure halting, a a counter example.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:27:50 GMT):<br/>
And yes, I agree with you in principle:  it's generally a bad idea for smart contracts to make network calls.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:28:09 GMT):<br/>
EVM is designed that for the same inputs the same outputs always exist.  Those inputs are defined via what is on the block chain.  If there was variance introduced by processor then that is not an input found on the chain.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:28:29 GMT):<br/>
And should we consider moving this conversation elsewhere?  While I enjoy this, it's probably not appropriate for this channel.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:28:33 GMT):<br/>
If a precompile contract were defined that would give CPU samplings the contract would be non-deterministic.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:29:38 GMT):<br/>
For consensus all nodes need to be able to re-produce the exact execution of the contract.  This is as evidenced by state changes, which includes balance, which is where gas would be charged if there wa a gas cost.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:30:08 GMT):<br/>
If gas is zero then the transaction receipt would have a different gas cost, and the receipts root is also a source of consensus checking.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:30:36 GMT):<br/>
That makes sense.  I'm just curious if something like the following could be done (it probably can't):  a contract is deterministic, and all runs use the same amount of memory, but the exact amount of memory it uses reveals something about a secret.  This could potentially be revealed by the gas cost.  
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:30:42 GMT):<br/>
Probably a dumb idea, but I was just curious.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:31:01 GMT):<br/>
However, the attacker could use invalid blocks being propagated to exfultrate the data.  This would depend on a custom precompile that was not deterministic.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:31:39 GMT):<br/>
Where should this discussion move to? I would like a good place for this and to discuss a standard set of host functions for wasm smart contracts.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:31:53 GMT):<br/>
A new working group or a task force?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:33:50 GMT):<br/>
@rjones What's the procedure to ask for a rocketchat channel?  I don't think the TSC wants to hear endlessly about this stuff.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:35:22 GMT):<br/>
I think that would be a good idea.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:36:39 GMT):<br/>
OK, I tagged Ry.  So hopefully he'll get back to us.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:36:47 GMT):<br/>
feels like it could be in the smart contracts WG or a task force of that working group.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:46:33 GMT):<br/>
so far that group has not been busy with these kinds of problems.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:48:05 GMT):<br/>
I think it should be specific to wasm and evm technologies, languages that compile to wasm to evm, and implementations/standards of the VM.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 18:09:42 GMT):<br/>
@hartm what name do you want
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 18:12:42 GMT):<br/>
@hartm I am enjoying it getting quite an education!
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 18:25:42 GMT):<br/>
@seanyoung Can you suggest a name then?  Some of the things you've been discussing have more general applications than just wasm.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 18:26:21 GMT):<br/>
Maybe "smart-contract-technical"?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 18:26:56 GMT):<br/>
"smart-contract-WASM"?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 18:27:27 GMT):<br/>
I talked with Sergio Benitez on Wednesday about oxide smart contracts.  It was pretty interesting, and they seem to offer a lot from a security perspective.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 18:27:32 GMT):<br/>
smart-contract-vm?
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 18:29:06 GMT):<br/>
or smart-contracts-runtimes
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 18:31:19 GMT):<br/>
All of those are basically fine.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 18:32:01 GMT):<br/>
I'd be curious to see what you all thought about this stuff:  https://cs242.stanford.edu/f18/lectures/07-1-sergio.html
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 18:51:11 GMT):<br/>
Making rust programs terminate if they run out of fuel/gas does proof they terminate without certain bounds. However what you really want to know is that the program *completes* within certain bounds. Not terminate early.

The osmium idea is interesting, but ignored the reality of the device driver authors: the internal state of the device is totally a black box. Anyway totally off topic
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 19:01:21 GMT):<br/>
You can't prove that programs complete within certain bounds unless you severely restrict the language (I'm sure you already know this, but I'll state it here for others).  I'm mostly interested in the oxide stuff for type safety.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 19:02:03 GMT):<br/>
Here's some brief formalization of some similar work that I found useful:  https://sergio.bz/docs/rusty-types-2016.pdf
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 19:43:02 GMT):<br/>
very interesting
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 21:24:57 GMT):<br/>
so as I understand it, the existing smart-contracts-wg deals with writing smart contracts and applying them to particular fields. 
What we're after is more about implementing smart contract languages and their VMs. I'm not sure how to best name that.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 28 Feb 2020 21:26:07 GMT):<br/>

As an example of cross-project integration, we have been working on integrating Fabric with Aries via DID anchoring. We have done some of our efforts within Hyperledger projects and some in our own Github repos.

Gah my bandwidth seems fine, maybe Zoom is overburdened thanks to covid19, I'll type out my point here so it doesn't get lost in audio glitches again.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 14:50:36 GMT):<br/>
We have a couple of dimensions to our "steering" which is more like "oversight": carrots (good things, encouragement, here's-something-that-works-let's-adopt-more-widely) and sticks (projects SHALL or SHALL NOT do X or Y). We can have both, and we want to use sticks rarely, but we have those options and can use them gradually to increase the amount of harmony between projects.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 14:51:04 GMT):<br/>
I think I'm also suffering from being in an area where all of the Amazon, Google, and Microsoft employees are working from home
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 14:51:46 GMT):<br/>
and then re-active vs pro-active - pro-active being things like what Dan is proposing, re-active being things like "hey our WASM efforts are all slightly and needlessly different, we should harmonize those"
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 14:52:31 GMT):<br/>
I'd like to point out that we could work on a common wasm host interface for smart contracts across our ledgers. I've made a tentative start here https://github.com/seanyoung/hyperwasm which I hope will become a labs project.

</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 14:52:36 GMT):<br/>
that's a nice thought... however, because every platform handles smart contract execution differently, then there is no reason to try to generalize
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 14:52:58 GMT):<br/>
I think Troy's point is that labs means "experimental", and this is more about refactoring
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 14:53:35 GMT):<br/>
@bbehlendorf We don't want to be overly restrictive, but what we do want to do is make sure there is enough communication between projects that, in your example, people realize early on that they all want to build WASM stuff and can decide on potential collaboration options before they start.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 14:53:38 GMT):<br/>
We should improve labs and make sure it can germinate useful projects, but also there may be a need for a different kind of project that is more about shared modules between projects
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 14:53:45 GMT):<br/>
building a general purpose, reusable component is extremely difficult and, frankly, the platforms (that would be the way to make the generalized platform useful and "meaningful" to the developers) aren't interested in general constructs
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 14:54:15 GMT):<br/>
It wouldn't be a 100% solution, but an 80% solution that covers commonaities would help the ecosystem.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 14:55:12 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon completely agree... but in practice that's not how it works... you need to come in with a module that has sufficient value to overcome the inertia in the existing solution
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 14:56:46 GMT):<br/>
to use a networking concept... we don't have a "narrow waist" that separates component/tool development from platform development
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 14:56:52 GMT):<br/>
Generally speaking, Mic, I agree, but users are far more interested than platform builders in portability.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 14:57:11 GMT):<br/>
then we need to give the users more voice in these conversations
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 14:57:31 GMT):<br/>
Seriously, I'm not sure there's great justification for these differences in WASM, at least as Silas described them to me. If there are, I think they should be more explicitly declared/justified, as it does carry substantial cognitive burden
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 14:58:18 GMT):<br/>
WASM provides a POTENTIAL narrow waist at least for application development, however... every platform has to expose their own native APIs (e.g. the fabric routines for storing data)
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 14:59:11 GMT):<br/>
obviously, i'm very interested in WASM (we just added support to the PDO lab project to run WASM contracts in an SGX enclave)
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 14:59:18 GMT):<br/>
I am very interested in helping Solang grow its community while still in Labs.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 14:59:29 GMT):<br/>
let's see if there are things we can improve in Labs to make that possible
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:01:07 GMT):<br/>
For solang I've had look at all the different ledgers. Actually the interface for storing/loading data is a good example where it is very similar on all the ledgers and straightforward to have the same interface.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:01:37 GMT):<br/>
What if one of the things we do is facilitate a conversation here. Without any preconditions of arriving at some shared component, we just get all the projects and labs together to talk about what they are doing. Maybe out of that comes some common problem that nobody wants to handle alone. Maybe there's no explicit outcome but at least everyone in that space is now connected so they can still collaborate even if it's on different code.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:01:57 GMT):<br/>
specically that meant about wasm.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:02:11 GMT):<br/>
get all the projects/labs that are working on wasm together for an hour or something like that.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:02:22 GMT):<br/>
Basically they all want a key-value store like leveldb (ethereum wants 32 bytes 
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:02:38 GMT):<br/>
though, but that's a terrible idea which I hope we can agree on)
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:02:58 GMT):<br/>
agreed @seanyoung  (as you know!)... and there are a number of problems that have to be overcome that will make it difficult... AND you still have to convince the various platforms (or enough of them at least) to add the wasm interpreter 
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:03:10 GMT):<br/>
it's 33 bytes or nothing! :rage: 
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:03:42 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:04:28 GMT):<br/>
fabric, sawtooth, burrow already have a wasm interpreter but they all have slightly different interfaces which is terrible for projects like grid.
What you want it is compile once - run anywhere.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:05:03 GMT):<br/>
not to be snarky... (but i will be anyway just because i like lively discussions...) but in four years of doing this, is WASM really the only example we have of something that could be practically useful cross-platform?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:05:38 GMT):<br/>
solidity was a little (burrow integrations with sawtooth, fab, etc.)
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:05:59 GMT):<br/>
transact might still be (narrow waist for engines)
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:06:43 GMT):<br/>
yes... and @seanyoung that is really what i mean... *someone* will have to go through and write the code for each of those platforms, get the code accepted by the developers (many of whom already have dependencies on their extent interfaces), provide all of the build/test/etc necessary to make it part of the project... building the WASM interpreter is the easy part
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:07:40 GMT):<br/>
the integration work isn't sexy but its absolutely necessary... and we have to figure out how to motivate it
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:09:05 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman so with the wasm standard we create, we can have some example assemblyscript, rust and Solidity (via Solang) support. So any ledger that supports it will get stuff for free. That might help your project too :smile: 
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:09:39 GMT):<br/>
you know that i'm planning to pick up your stuff asap
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:10:23 GMT):<br/>
I'm just finishing dynamic array support will improve string support, once that is done I'll start looking at your project.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:10:32 GMT):<br/>
just pushed a PR into PDO last night that brings our WASM support up to the current WAMR version... which means we can start exploring execution of native code generated by their AOT compiler :-)
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:17:17 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman Most hyperledger platforms have EVM support (mostly via burrow), so there's another cross-platform target.

32 bytes actually might make sense on a public blockchain like Ethereum, since it's the minimum you'd want if you wanted to make it cryptographically hard to find collisions. 
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Fri, 13 Mar 2020 06:37:58 GMT):<br/>
When chain code is executed, the wasm code, storage, and inputs are all unknown to any node in the chain. So if you have e.g. a hash table in your smart contract storage you might want to make it difficult to find collisions. 

However, most on-chain data strutures are much more plain; e.g. simple lists, or  primitive types. These do not need to be stored under a hashed key and such a large key is just overhead.

Conversely you might want to have composite types, e.g. a hash table, containing a mapping from string to a structure, and that structure contains an large static sparse array and a hash itself. For this, it useful to have a concatenated key. 32 bytes is very limited in this case and special care must be taking to avoid collisions.

In fact, Solidity on Ethereum suffers from this problem. If you declare a spare array large enough, the solc compiler will warning you might get collisions. 
`
pragma solidity 0;

contract c {
        int[2**128] foo;
}
`
solc says:
`
$ solc f.sol
f.sol:4:2: Warning: Variable covers a large part of storage and thus makes collisions likely. Either use mappings or dynamic arrays and allow their size to be increased only in small quantities per transaction.
        int[2**128] foo;
        ^-------------^
`
This can be avoid by having storage keys length.

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 14:08:43 GMT):<br/>
Yep, thanks for commenting @duncanjw 
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 14:08:57 GMT):<br/>
@rjones Yes, I think we do.  Ursa certainly does.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 14:10:19 GMT):<br/>
The key is just depending on Apache 2.0 things, and things that you think are likely to be well-maintained (and, things that you must be willing to maintain/pull in yourself if people stop maintaining).

@Dan +1 to starting somewhere e.g. with consensus or storage

<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 15:05:07 GMT):<br/>
@jamesbarry my CCLang project is definitely in the spirit of what you're getting at: https://github.com/dhuseby/cclang It is currently an RFC for Ursa: https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa-rfcs/pull/17 
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 15:05:25 GMT):<br/>
CCLang is to cryptographic constructs what postscript is to printers
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 15:06:26 GMT):<br/>
where it really shines is the asynchronous construction and validation of parallel and serial multi-sig digital signatures
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 15:10:01 GMT):<br/>
@wkatsak ^^^
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 15:10:58 GMT):<br/>
I'm already using CCLang for an abstracted block storage for a local-first, offline-first personal data provenance/sync tool.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 15:11:28 GMT):<br/>
I'm using it to handle keeping all of my dotfiles synchronized across all of my Linux computers and servers as a test case.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 15:13:54 GMT):<br/>
I think it is a good abstraction point for cryptographic constructs and fits nicely on top of the crypto algorithm abstractions of Ursa
</p>
<p><strong>jamesbarry</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 15:17:16 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for giving us the opportunity to present.  I see Hyperledger as in a position to assert real leadership in the Blockchain industry.  Ideally it would be great to have Hyperledger formed projects/components embedded in multiple blockchains, regardless of where they come from.

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:44:19 GMT):<br/>
I think these modules should be viewed as not just about being shared among frameworks but also enable more customized external usage for a particular solution.

<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:45:12 GMT):<br/>
@cbf could you talk about why fabric maintainers chose to not incorporate transact into fabric right now? the motivation for adding or not adding would be very insightful
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:45:16 GMT):<br/>
e.g., we are building components in external repos that could be useful beyond ourselves.

and i know we've had the discussion for why fabric is not using ursa (language bindings)... how much work would the ursa team ned to do to make it reasonable for fabric to switch to ursa?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:47:25 GMT):<br/>
beyond language bindings, I think it is preferable to have Go native code.

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:47:25 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:47:29 GMT):<br/>
The question I think that we need to answer is: how can we motivate people to work together on common components?  We haven't been effective at this.  I think most of our core contributors are business-focused and paid to contribute by their employers, and their priorities are on the business cycle.  What can we do to encourage everyone to work together?  I think maybe just trying to get people that are working on similar components across different projects to share ideas periodically might be a good start.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:49:55 GMT):<br/>
Sometimes the native code approach is taken (e.g., https://github.com/google/tink)
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:51:55 GMT):<br/>
To follow up:  asking people who are under business deadlines to refactor their code to accommodate modular interfaces might be a tough ask.  Asking these people to have a periodic meeting with similar people across different projects to discuss ideas and plans isn't such a big ask, and might lead to future modular interfaces, because it's much easier to work together if you're starting from scratch than trying to refactor code.  It might also lead to better ideas and implementations across projects. 
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:53:15 GMT):<br/>
I like what @cbf is saying. This was exactly the method for the creation of Ursa. There was this large chunk of functionality that all of our projects had to do and had to do in similar ways.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:53:21 GMT):<br/>
So Ursa was born
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:53:46 GMT):<br/>
how many projects are using ursa?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:53:50 GMT):<br/>
The only remaining blocker for Fabric using Ursa is the Go/Rust barrier
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:54:08 GMT):<br/>
Iroha, Indy, Aries
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:54:29 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder any more projects using Ursa?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:54:38 GMT):<br/>
There are a few projects outside of HL that are using it
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:54:42 GMT):<br/>
We also have the Go/Rust barrier in Aries-framework-go
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:54:42 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:58:06 GMT):<br/>
does "retire a maintainer" mean they get taken out back and shot ?
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:58:26 GMT):<br/>
right... libraries are I think less valuable in this polyglot environment we have
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:58:40 GMT):<br/>
microservices OTOH...
</p>
<p><strong>cbf</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:58:53 GMT):<br/>
as long as they share a common protocol
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:59:59 GMT):<br/>
I agree with you
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 15:00:24 GMT):<br/>
it would be interesting to make Ursa a standalone microservice
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 26 Mar 2020 15:00:48 GMT):<br/>
we might have to do that anyways for use in applications that use physically isolated HSMs

I wonder if the TSC maintainers could play that role of promoting RFCs we think would be helpful for the rest of the Hyperledger family?

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 02 Apr 2020 14:22:09 GMT):<br/>
Yep, even just a one-sentence description of new RFCs might be useful, as Chris suggests.

@cbf I just did a quick recon on automating posts from Github RFC repos to a Groups.io mailing list and it is definitely doable. I confirmed that Groups.io does have an API for posting new messages. I also confirmed that it is possible to write a Github action that logs into Groups.io and posts a message based on arbitrary triggers. If a project decided that their RFC lifecycle was submit, final review, rejected or merged then they could set up triggers for those status tags and have automated posts to Groups.io.

Doesn’t that make the interoperability validators a trust proxy for the foreign network, why not validate directly on chain code?

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 14:30:51 GMT):<br/>
@nage There are old lower bounds that imply that two-party exchange can't be done without a trust proxy.  The issue is that the relevant set of chain codes exists on multiple blockchains and may not be able to talk to each other directly.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 14:32:43 GMT):<br/>
If I'm swapping an asset on blockchain A for a different one one blockchain B, then this meta-transaction consists of (at least) one transaction on each blockchain.  There needs to be some way to ensure that either both sub-transactions happen or neither happen, and this can't usually be done with existing chaincode on blockchains.  
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 14:40:37 GMT):<br/>
@hartm two-way peg?
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 14:40:37 GMT):<br/>
@hartm how about using a two-way peg to avoid trust proxy?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 14:44:40 GMT):<br/>
@seanyoung That works well for sidechains, but not so well for two completely different chains.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 14:45:16 GMT):<br/>
@hartm how many more slides to you guys have?

</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 14:46:27 GMT):<br/>
how so?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 14:49:09 GMT):<br/>
Yes but the concept of cross chain finality only really exists with either cross anchoring or deferring to a trust mechanism of policy or (misplaced?) optimism.  How does deferring that to this intermediary processor not undermine both chains dependent state in the same way we see in the oracle problem?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 14:53:44 GMT):<br/>
In my understanding, a two way peg requires locking one asset so that another can be used on a side chain.  We want to do full asset exchanges so that both can be used.  Is my definition of two-way peg what you're thinking?
</p>
<p><strong>mwklein</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 14:54:45 GMT):<br/>
There are physical examples within the lab project:  https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-integration-framework
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 14:55:24 GMT):<br/>
is it the case that each transactor could run a BIF (as opposed to having a 3rd party running a BIF for several transactors/companies)?
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 14:56:58 GMT):<br/>
two way peg can be used for full asset exchanges
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 14:58:08 GMT):<br/>
Making cross chain transactions possible is not that hard. Making it possible in a trusted way is very hard.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 14:58:27 GMT):<br/>
I guess what I'm asking is "Where's the BIF?" :hamburger: 
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 14:58:31 GMT):<br/>
You're right.  We use (depending on configuration) both cross anchoring and deferring trust to external validators.  Which oracle problem are you referring to?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 14:59:23 GMT):<br/>
I'm guessing that our "overlay" solution very much resembles what you're defining as a two way peg here.
</p>
<p><strong>mwklein</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 15:00:02 GMT):<br/>
BIF has its own validator nodes that can run on a subset of a given DLT nodes and provides an overlay network for transacting across chains.
</p>
<p><strong>mwklein</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 15:01:11 GMT):<br/>
So BIF could be centralized, but the vision is for it to be deployed in a federated model of validators across chains
</p>

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 15:05:21 GMT):<br/>
I must say I was a bit confused by the assertion that BIF wouldn't limit to the common denominator and then the statement that if a transaction involve a network that can't support private transaction there is no expectation of privacy

those two statements seem to contradict each other, don't they?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 15:07:16 GMT):<br/>
@lehors It's definitely the case that if one network involved in a transaction cannot support private transactions, then there is no expectation of privacy.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 15:07:35 GMT):<br/>
I think the point about the common denominator was that BIF should not be the bottleneck in any operations.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 15:07:39 GMT):<br/>
I guess that wasn't clear.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 15:08:37 GMT):<br/>
In other words, if two networks are fast, then we don't want BIF to slow them down.  If two networks give good privacy guarantees, we don't want BIF to compromise that.  Obviously some goals in this regard are really ambitious and we can't meet them all at this point, but that's the objective.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 15:08:54 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 15:55:22 GMT):<br/>
Now that we're not constrained by the meeting, if you point out an explicit definition of two-way peg, I can probably answer this question in more detail if you'd like.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 17:57:07 GMT):<br/>
It is hard to come to consensus on observations that occur outside of the chain, things coming from the other chain have that same issue.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 16 Apr 2020 18:37:12 GMT):<br/>
Yep!  This is why blockchain integration is a difficult task, and some kind of (federated) trusted mediation is needed.
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 14:04:36 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 14:26:20 GMT):<br/>
I'm in favor of links here for stuff like this because it seems like it will be difficult and annoying to force updates if we change things in these policies.

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 14:42:36 GMT):<br/>
the links could refer to the hash at the time, if they like.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 14:42:56 GMT):<br/>
so then the hash would be of a pointer and a hash... huh
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 14:42:59 GMT):<br/>
I was looking for that repo...for some reason I could not find it
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 14:43:40 GMT):<br/>
makes sense if those are governance docs that they should reside in hyperledger/tsc
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 23 Apr 2020 14:44:00 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 14:18:24 GMT):<br/>
Mic++  I prefer ledger-native transaction validation approaches (like state proofs) rather than proxy approaches, but this seems like a reasonable step forward with interest from different groups with more than one business motivation.  So it seems like something that can be a sustainable project.
</p>

Labs have their place. When something wants to progress from a lab it should satisfy a few things which I won't type all of here, but basically maturity, resourcing, utility to HL.

Angelo, perhaps you should propose the private chaincode lab as a full fledged project
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 14:25:29 GMT):<br/>
I think people would probably support the Fabric private chaincode becoming a project.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 14:25:34 GMT):<br/>
I guess with these two categories, it seems to be difficult to evaluate the threshold for some projects. Particularly with earlier projects or less sponsors on it.

</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 14:30:57 GMT):<br/>
rather than FPC... i think PDO is a better example of a lab project that should stay a lab project. we use it for collaboration to develop concepts. those concepts (and some of the code) has migrated into several other mature projects. the lab facilitates collaboration on ideas that can be matured through other channels
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 30 Apr 2020 14:56:31 GMT):<br/>
The problem with any anti-cabal mechanism is the HLP charter requires a majority vote of maintainers of a project to approve new maintainers.  The only real check I see in that case is for the TSC to move the project to deprecated.

I am intrigued by the idea of an alternating maintainers call, but we’d have to know that there is an appetite for it.  Many see the TSC as representing them for those processes so that they don’t have to deal with any of that stuff directly.

I think the "sponsorship list" is a great idea, but can we list people by categories?  In other words, encourage people to choose a sponsor based on the type of lab.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 14:48:40 GMT):<br/>
I see the future... it is an out of date list
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 14:48:50 GMT):<br/>
yes?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 14:49:34 GMT):<br/>
it's a list where I've delegated to the edge
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 11 Jun 2020 14:50:10 GMT):<br/>
I like the friendly sponsor list idea and am happy to be listed.  With machine parsable maintainer lists it seems like an obvious improvement to have an automatically up to date full Hyperledger Maintainers directory.

@rjones @tkuhrt I am adding a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md to one of the project repos. Is https://hyperledger.github.io/tsc/code-of-conduct.html a stable URL to link against?

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 24 Jun 2020 15:15:31 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda the goal of having the TSC repo is that it is the source of truth.

From the original Lab proposal "Labs representation

It is not permitted to publicly refer to work under the hyperledger-labs org as an “Hyperledger project” and directly use the Hyperledger brand as in “Hyperledger <lab_name>”. One may refer to this type of work as a “Hyperledger Lab” and use “<lab_name>, a Hyperledger Lab.”

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 16 Jul 2020 14:55:09 GMT):<br/>
A lot of our maintainers/contributors don't really follow the TSC or overall maintainer stuff, so I'm not sure they would even be aware of these meetings.  Having someone from marketing show up to a technical meeting (and asking for agenda space well in advance) once in a while to make people aware of marketing resources might be a good thing.

Was the survey only sent out in English?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 30 Jul 2020 14:27:16 GMT):<br/>
I think that's correct.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 30 Jul 2020 14:38:29 GMT):<br/>
I'm guessing we got lower response rates from East Asia then due to this.  I suspect that more than 2% of our contributor base is from China (correct me if I'm wrong here), which, if I read the survey responses correctly, was the response rate from China.

Also, about subprojects:  how do we count use by projects outside of Hyperledger?  For instance, a large component of Ursa growth at this point is from of people who don't even use Hyperledger blockchains--they're just interested in, say, anonymous credentials.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 13 Aug 2020 15:02:48 GMT):<br/>
it's an implementation detail. Labs used to be a whole other top level thing, I moved it under Hyperledger, but I still need to jiggle all the data. it may be a month or so before I can revisit
</p>
<p><strong>davidkhala</strong> (Wed, 19 Aug 2020 14:03:47 GMT):<br/>
Well, I am also expecting a better `used by` statistic sidebar on Github. If those using repos are hosted on github then it would possibly be counted in github future release.

As far as Explorer:  no promises, but there may be a Cactus GUI in the works.  If we get this working, then it will obviously have to work with many ledgers, and maybe we can work with the Explorer community on this.   But no promises for now...
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 20 Aug 2020 14:18:46 GMT):<br/>

Over the last few years many of us have tried to find ways to get more cross-project collab. Cutting projects that strive to be cross-project works against that. Our efforts should be to facilitate success.

Having looked at and having not to be able to reuse a few projects (in good faith on both sides), we need to make sure that each project is measured both directions: from the internal project perspective and from the external consumer perspective.

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 20 Aug 2020 14:41:43 GMT):<br/>
Explorer dates back from the days when we made Fabric SDKs (e.g. the Java and Python SDKs) top level projects.  It was a point in time when we had a very different organizational philosophy on projects.

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 20 Aug 2020 14:42:18 GMT):<br/>
Composer became EOL because the maintainers left. I can't tell if it's coming up here because of misinterpretations about whether or not it was cross project. It's unrelated to this discussion.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 20 Aug 2020 14:42:58 GMT):<br/>
Composer thought about ledger deployment and adoption differently than other blockchain projects and it helped recruit project participants that made the rest of our community better

I honestly thought that Composer was just a victim of its own success.  They did such a good job that people wanted to build real blockchains on top of Composer, which was not what the maintainers intended.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 20 Aug 2020 14:46:54 GMT):<br/>
One thing we haven't done is ask the maintainers of the project that we're discussing here why they want separate projects (or, maybe they don't even care--who knows--but the point is we don't know).  Should we ask them for their opinions?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 20 Aug 2020 14:47:33 GMT):<br/>
My "shoot from the hip" take on questions for deciding if something is a stand alone project: "Does the architecture support multiple frameworks?" (If no --> look for home in existing framework or lab)
If yes: "Will the existing developers commit to spend resource to support contributions from another framework?" (If no --> look for home in existing framework or lab)
If yes and the project is more than 12 months old: "Has anyone made such contributions and what was their experience?"

If the answer is that they are working together or that the experience wasn't negative (even if cross-framework use didn't result) I say we give the project a pass and let things continue and ask the questions again at the next project report.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 20 Aug 2020 16:28:44 GMT):<br/>
Some possible verbiage for consideration @lehors in a proposal:

We will consider a project a top-level project if it meets one of the following criteria:
* one that is used across more than one Hyperledger project (e.g., Caliper)
* one that is used by both a Hyperledger project and a project outside of Hyperledger (e.g., Ursa, Aries)

The above leaves a lot out like timeframe that we give for a project to meet one of these goals. It also wouldn't help us to decide on future DLT platforms/frameworks. And probably a lot of other things that we would need/want to consider.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 20 Aug 2020 16:55:52 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @tkuhrt, this is indeed the kind of objective criteria we need to establish
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 20 Aug 2020 17:29:42 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt Is that ment to be an all-inclusive definition?  What about stand alone projects?  For example if another DLT or client for a DLT network comes in?  Or projects that work only with non-HL projects, like a bitcoin L2 solution?
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 20 Aug 2020 18:37:30 GMT):<br/>
Evolving the criteria for approving a top-level project is one thing; criteria for evaluating current projects is another. The issue with Transact may have been that it was approved before it really should have been (it probably should have gestated longer as a lab, for instance) but that's a moot point now; the question is more what the TSC can or should do to help Transact become what it was destined to, or what corrective action it can or should take if it's not intending to head in that direction originally promised

Hi, @shemnon (Danno). My take was definitely not meant to represent an all inclusive definition. Thus my comment that followed:
> It also wouldn't help us to decide on future DLT platforms/frameworks.

Regarding the point about projects that work with non-HL projects, that would be something that the TSC would need to agree with and whether projects made sense within the greater Hyperledger mission.

There are also some situations we may not have considered:  what if the framework/parent project doesn't want to take the child project?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 03 Sep 2020 14:39:54 GMT):<br/>
If a framework maintainer group concludes they cannot support a project that is entirely dependent on that framework, approving it as a top level project undermines their authority as maintainers no?   This proposal gives us a better tool to review that.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 03 Sep 2020 14:41:33 GMT):<br/>
Our role there would be to help encourage and support inclusivity and good collaboration culture in that maintainer group rather than steamroll them by approving the project that is ultimately dependent on their support.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Sep 2020 14:44:45 GMT):<br/>
Fundamentally, doesn't this come down to marketing?  If we're not going to change how projects are managed, then merging projects is essentially just declaring that certain repos would be affiliated.  It probably wouldn't even change maintainer structure.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Sep 2020 14:46:55 GMT):<br/>
Maybe it makes sense just to accept some kind of unequal marketing amongst projects (which is already happening, I imagine, and this is totally fine).  We could have a greenhouse graphic that is skewed towards the more commonly used top level projects, for instance.

seriously? I get on the order of 100+ emails a day from hyperledger sources... whether I use gmail does not change the fact that it is impossible to deal individually with each. This is why I requested that THIS election email go to my work email, because at least there I can hope to notice it (despite the fact that I also get tons of spam but it would stick out better there.

<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 03 Sep 2020 15:02:42 GMT):<br/>
Chris, if I recall correctly (and I'll check), your work email address, as well as Arnaud's and Gari's, were set as "never contact" by LF's automated messaging systems as a result of clicking an opt-out link at some point with a "never contact again" checkbox clicked. I think that was corrected before this outreach, and the election mail was sent to your work address, but again will double check.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 03 Sep 2020 18:33:27 GMT):<br/>
It would be helpful to be specific about the intent in relation to existing projects. A policy that forces X project and Y project to merge may be equivalent to ejecting X project or Y project from HL. Such a move should be explicit and discussed. As it is now, it sounds like malicious maneuvering against projects that specific TSC members aren't directly invested in. TSC should focus instead on fostering collaboration instead of attacking projects. "If you don't write your project report the right way, we will immediately start to talk about 'sanctions' or removing the project." isn't collaborative.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Fri, 04 Sep 2020 08:40:15 GMT):<br/>
I agree, mostly. We should talk more about the sequence of events as I think it's less about rules or lack of them and more about unachieved goals or expectations. I wrote up what I think is the bigger issue here. https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/tsc/message/3112

I am pretty sure you could define some very adversarial numbering systems using Danno's modified proposal!  Something like Version = g^{ Hash(version)} for some group of unknown order and random oracle.  Sorry for nerding out here...

My previous project used Ubuntu-style numbering; it was fine.

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 17 Sep 2020 14:31:52 GMT):<br/>
did it have an API or was it more like an OS?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 17 Sep 2020 14:32:03 GMT):<br/>
Stuff like aries and ursa are meant to be consumed as libraries.  A stand alone process, such as an ethereum client, would not be a library.  If besu spin out libraries those would be API versioned.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 17 Sep 2020 14:32:08 GMT):<br/>
You could also define a numbering system over some complex ring.

Figuring out this email stuff is good, though.  If we want to do meaningful surveys of community feedback (e.g. DCI, etc.) then making sure we have a good way to communicate with the community is important.

Back in the day, I attempted to create a maturity report for projects. You can see thoughts about possible items to consider here: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-community-management-tools/blob/master/project-reports/docs/requirements.md. We might be able to use the community bridge/analytics tool to pull some of this information into an easily digestable report

Brian compared the CII badge to active status.  I think we need to answer the question as to whether or not active status is a simple metric for the outside community (like the CII badge) or some kind of internal milestone for projects.  I think it's useful to note, though, that the CII badge process is much simpler than achieving active status, and doesn't require approval of a governing body.

CII Badge also doesn't reflect community size, diversity, and activity.
To echo @mastersingh24 's comment, seeing that really isn't too hard. You can see metrics .. commit frequency on github. Diversity is harder to see.

Cool thanks. Anyone using the collaborators settings? Looks like you can control roles directly with that. Like you could add and remove maintainers by PR.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 01 Oct 2020 20:23:46 GMT):<br/>
I think that's available via codeowners? Not that I know of
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 01 Oct 2020 20:32:15 GMT):<br/>
I think codeowners is just for notification on PRs.
I was looking at this example https://github.com/apps/settings for settings that shows a `collaborators` field that assigns pull/push/admin. Seems less granular than the full set of settings that e.g. restricts force pushes etc. The warning on that page is also notable .. push==admin
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 02 Oct 2020 00:02:45 GMT):<br/>
Admins can flip a switch to require codeowners to be a reviewa approver for a PR - https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-required-reviews-for-pull-requests

@shemnon I think that is the case for all of the hyperledger repos, but I'm not sure. The auditing tools for GitHub need work. If you have pointers to nice ones, let me know?

<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 14:50:07 GMT):<br/>
Renaming the TSC to the Community Steering Committee to better describe its role may be appropriate. There are currently "project-level TSCs", the maintainer calls or email lists. You still want some forum & decision-making body regarding the community across Hyperledger.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 14:52:53 GMT):<br/>
In the very beginning, I guess I expected the governing board to do more of the "community management."

<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 14:56:26 GMT):<br/>
I really like the idea of "promoting" important issues from some of the projects, SIGs and WGs into the TSC meeting discussions.  It might be a good way to get technical obstacles heard by a wider audience--more like a code review or an academic forum than "how do we make rules to fix this process" discussion.  The question there is how do we find those topics and recruit the right audience.  Right now those of us looking for those discussions are subscribed to the project lists and show up at random to other calls.

@mwagner he'd already quit when you said that
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 15:00:44 GMT):<br/>
When we've emailed voters, we've consistently asked people to check their spam folders, giving them the address the ballot is coming from. That did catch a few.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 15:04:21 GMT):<br/>
It does feel like 98% of the election problem has been deliver-ability from the CIVS system to people's inboxes, which seems to be much worse this year than previous years. @seanyoung 's comments on DKIM amplify that. We've been using an external, hosted service both for simplicity and objectivity - as a system we don't run, we can't be accused of putting our thumb on the scales. But that now clearly comes at the cost of ability to deliver a trusted election to not just 98% of eligible voters but 100% of them, because we can't see where the failures are. So next year I suspect we'll decide to use a system we drive directly, favoring something that works over something separated.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 15:14:55 GMT):<br/>
Here's another place where not having direct control over CIVS causes us grief. By design, CIVS does not retain the email addresses of the ballots it sends out, but it does retain a hash. If we give it an email address, it can tell us if it's already been provisioned a ballot in a given poll, or if it represents a new address. We can always add a second email address for someone to the voting rolls, but we can't invalidate their earlier address and corresponding ballot.  So, if that person is not honest, it allows them to vote twice. So, while we are happy to use a different address if we can't get the first one to work after a couple of attempts, there are trust issues with using secondary email addresses frequently.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 15:23:58 GMT):<br/>
And it may be stating the obvious, but it's possible that the tension and anxiety we all feel around the upcoming US election may be transferring to our interactions here. Apologies if my own defensiveness is coming from that.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 19:56:44 GMT):<br/>
True.  My work email has several tiers of spam filter, though--one of which I have to log on to a website to even find messages that get flagged.  I'm assuming other people are in the same boat.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 08 Oct 2020 19:57:04 GMT):<br/>
The IACR uses the same system and seems to have no problem getting emails sent and through spam filters.  I'm curious what they are doing differently.

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 15 Oct 2020 17:39:15 GMT):<br/>
yes, unfortunately, the election was for the `Hyperleder TSC Chair`, not the `Hyperledger TSC Chair`, so you've all voted for some other thing

For the new ideas agenda item: Over the last year the TSC expressed a desire to raise the level of technical discussion in TSC meetings.  To help with this I would like to propose a once monthly technical topic on our agenda.  If it is desirable, I will reach out to each project maintainer group, the SIGs and WGs in turn to ask for a technical, architectural or interesting innovation or academic papers to discuss at the TSC level that the project maintainers believe are of general interest, fun or deserve more attention.  If we can get enough productive topics we could consider doing it as often as every other week, but certainly this shouldn’t be _the_ way to get good technical discussions on the agenda, just an effort by the TSC to solicit those topics from the community and make the community more comfortable bringing up interesting discussions on their own.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 14:43:03 GMT):<br/>
Good feedback, Baohua, regarding timing
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 14:43:58 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 14:44:38 GMT):<br/>
This is a good idea, Nathan. I agree that we need to get projects and labs presenting interesting things that they are working on or considering starting in order to do the cross-project collaboration

@grace.hartley The DCI WG experience with surveys was that people don't respond to surveys :)
</p>
<p><strong>grace.hartley</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 14:47:38 GMT):<br/>
Haha very fair feedback. Maybe an interview process sampling community members would be a better strategy to gain feedback?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 14:48:34 GMT):<br/>
Yeah that could work. I think one idea that came up that didn't get follow-up was TSC members going to the project meetings and doing outreach to the projects
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 14:51:23 GMT):<br/>
If the TSC is representative of the community, I would hope we have folks attending most technical meetings already.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 14:52:06 GMT):<br/>
Maybe we should test that by asking what meetings we attend to identify any gaps?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 14:52:17 GMT):<br/>
+1 on the surveys.  I worry that the surveys we do perform have such a low response rate that there might be a large sampling bias.

</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 14:53:26 GMT):<br/>
It probably wouldn't hurt for each TSC member to pick a meeting / community they haven't participated in and join it for a session.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 14:53:34 GMT):<br/>
A survey to the TSC. :) I agree though, Nathan. We should put together a wiki page that covers all of the different WGs, Labs and projects meetings and allow us to respond back whether we attend (always, sometimes, never)
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 14:54:59 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 05 Nov 2020 15:19:02 GMT):<br/>
```Require projects to provide as part of their quarterly reports a direct link to the relevant Insights dashboard to make it easier for reviewers to get to that data. Links should follow the following template link for Fabric (i.e., name of project and time range will need to be set as appropriate):

https://lfanalytics.io/projects/hyperledger/fabric/dashboard;subTab=technical?time={"from":"2020-07-01T07:00:00.000Z","type":"absolute","to":"2020-10-01T07:00:00.000Z"}
The report template will be updated accordingly.```

we can still call them blockchains if we're using DLT's to manage provenance and consensus around the provenance of important data such as proof-of-existence and identity key events
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 05 Nov 2020 15:42:58 GMT):<br/>
off-chain storage has been the best practice since early in year one of Hyperledger
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 05 Nov 2020 15:44:06 GMT):<br/>
We have definitely said no to proposals.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 05 Nov 2020 15:46:08 GMT):<br/>
But were those rejected for hard and fast policies (Apache 2, patents, etc) or for scope issues?

<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 05 Nov 2020 15:48:57 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 05 Nov 2020 15:51:21 GMT):<br/>
We haven't rejected for scope issues.  But we have definitely "soft rejected" projects where we said "come back when you have changed XXXXXX" and we never heard back.

</p>
<p><strong>Bobbijn</strong> (Thu, 05 Nov 2020 15:53:30 GMT):<br/>
If we create a technology wish list and challenge the community , we could get projects started in areas that are lacking.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 05 Nov 2020 15:56:43 GMT):<br/>
I think adding this kind of presentation to the TSC meetings once a month (as Tracy is suggesting) is a great idea.  It would hopefully also increase TSC meeting turnout by maintainers.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 05 Nov 2020 16:02:10 GMT):<br/>
given the lack of hackfests and similar meetings I too find this an interesting idea

Question, now that Mark mentioned the hackfests:  is it worth going ahead and starting to think about what we want these to look like in the post-COVID future (if at all)?  Hopefully we'll all be vaccinated in the not too distant future and have the option to travel again.
</p>

I'm pretty sure the _*one*_ interop project that would get lots of traction is a "wallet kit" and good documentation/tutorials on how to build W3C VC capabilities into mobile apps and/or creating a branded VC app.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 15:30:59 GMT):<br/>
Agree with @DannoFerrin , core protocol development could even converge to fewer than today. TSC has capacity to foster projects up the stack
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 15:31:55 GMT):<br/>
Protocols are the right way to get interop/integration
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 15:35:20 GMT):<br/>
One example for developer tooling: if we had a project that is an implementation of Baseline Protocol (https://baseline-protocol.org/) but with pluggable backends to the other Hyperledger Project DLTs.

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 15:53:31 GMT):<br/>
I'd like to see what a stack focused diagram might look like.  That stack that was part of the member summit report.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 15:55:12 GMT):<br/>
We could also have an application-focused diagram that ignores the more technical projects focused on developers rather than end users.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 15:57:03 GMT):<br/>
Rather than ignoring developer focused projects maybe make them a layer in the stack?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 15:59:57 GMT):<br/>
This would turn the stack into some kind of directed graph.  I've mentioned this before as a possibility, but people didn't like it.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 16:00:10 GMT):<br/>
Should we do scheduled presentations before the discussion style items in the future?

@shemnon Yes.  We usually push unstructured discussion to the end.

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 19 Nov 2020 16:03:45 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 15:05:24 GMT):<br/>
It may be useful to reach out for either a presentation or if there's something specific we'd love their input on - for example, someone from CNCF can help us understand the Kube move from Docker to containerd and what that might mean for Fabric or BAF and the right way to be cloud native across our projects

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 15:22:01 GMT):<br/>
Can we come up with a take on the greenhouse that is focused on applications and end users rather than developers (i.e. less focus on libraries/tools)?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 15:22:14 GMT):<br/>
Maybe this will help clear up some external confusion.

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 15:22:32 GMT):<br/>
We could also do a dirty, glorious DAG that highlights all of the complexity for developers.

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 15:26:55 GMT):<br/>
I feel like developers would appreciate a DAG.  Plus, it would serve as advertisements for our libraries and tools since it would be evident that they are in use.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 15:29:10 GMT):<br/>

I'm thinking @shemnon should lead a task force on coming up with a potential badging system.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 15:35:48 GMT):<br/>
Figuring out a criteria would be awesome.  Even if we don't end up changing the status quo, just putting this "badge" information on our website in an easily consumable form would be useful to people looking to understand Hyperledger projects.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 15:37:22 GMT):<br/>
Ideally the criteria for these things would be totally objective.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 15:39:47 GMT):<br/>
Badges don't have to be binary.  You obviously don't go directly from "non-diverse" community to "diverse."  We can have a continuum that doesn't make projects stress about badges.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 15:40:21 GMT):<br/>
Something like the CII badge has gradiations
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 15:43:01 GMT):<br/>
It's right to worry about gaming the badging system, but even a "hurry let's get 5 random people to make commits in time for the diversity badge" can trigger positive outcomes. :)
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 15:43:47 GMT):<br/>
@rjones Right.  Importantly, pretty much all of the CII badge criteria is also objective.  It's a pretty good system.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 15:44:34 GMT):<br/>
If it's getting new contributors, that's great.  But if it's one guy signing into 5 different dummy accounts to add one-line comments to code, then that's not so great.  Unfortunately I think the latter would be more likely...
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 15:46:26 GMT):<br/>
Apache also has a comparably heavyweight release process with required voting by maintainers and PMCs.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 15:49:30 GMT):<br/>
I personally have heard from few that Hyperledger has hard entry point restrictions :) It hurts
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 16:50:41 GMT):<br/>
Great suggestion. Specially on the BAF part. I'll note it down to be brought up in never meeting. 
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 17:23:12 GMT):<br/>
Here is an incomplete badging proposal.  The key portions for Legal and Community support are present and should be enough to determine if the rest of the badges should be filled out in a similar way or if the TSC want something different - https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/~shemnon/Project+Badging+Proposal

<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 14 Jan 2021 15:24:43 GMT):<br/>
I remember when Cactus was first proposed to TSC, it was told it should not be considered as blockchain connecting multiple underlying networks. But rather it should be considered as a framework that helps in connecting those blockchain network. Is this correct understanding?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 14 Jan 2021 15:25:07 GMT):<br/>
To be more precise with Cactus and middlemen, we want to emphasize that no middleman is *required*.  The system is modular enough that you can configure the business logic plugin to be as centralized or decentralized as you like--in other words, you can have a middleman if you want, but it is certainly not required.  That being said, there are certain cases where you need some sort of external trust (e.g. working with a blockchain like bitcoin that doesn't natively support powerful smart contracts).
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 14 Jan 2021 15:25:40 GMT):<br/>
That's correct.  I believe this is the "integration" vs "interoperability" discussion.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 14 Jan 2021 15:26:22 GMT):<br/>
@adc We're working on a full academic paper with a UC-inspired security model.  It's still not complete though.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 14 Jan 2021 15:26:57 GMT):<br/>
We'll sent it to you when it's in a state to read.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 14 Jan 2021 15:27:15 GMT):<br/>
So, do we call Cactus a integration framework?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 14 Jan 2021 15:27:24 GMT):<br/>
That's what we call it anyway.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 14 Jan 2021 15:31:06 GMT):<br/>
Makes me more curious on how is trust is anchored from siloed blockchain network, does it require any modifications to the underlying blockchain framework?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 14 Jan 2021 15:32:14 GMT):<br/>
Please use the "raise hand" feature to get in the queue
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 14 Jan 2021 15:33:54 GMT):<br/>
We don't assume that we can modify underlying blockchains.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 14 Jan 2021 15:34:55 GMT):<br/>
However, this does make some actions difficult.  For instance, we can't do powerful smart contracts on bitcoin.  So if we want to integrate bitcoin into something, trust becomes slightly more complicated:  we need to trust someone or some system (potentially decentralized, obviously) to attest to bitcoin transactions.

Thanks Ry, it would help to have a document like this https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/hipe/en/latest/text/0002-agents/README.html. But dedicated to Aries and not couple it up with Indy.

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 15:24:05 GMT):<br/>
As mentioned in the report, aries-framework-go wasn't based on the indy codebase (and implemented some updated protocols) which has resulted in some differences.

The current document currently, as I understand from feedbacks I received is to start with one of the agent. For example, the `aca-py` goes very deep on providing a specific example in detail.

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 15:28:56 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the presentation David and Ry!  This definitely seems like something we should try with other projects.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 15:32:53 GMT):<br/>
Fabric was the example I was going to use :)
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 15:33:20 GMT):<br/>
Active status is about community involvement, right?  So I think active status should probably either judge the whole community, or the community of the largest sub-project.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 15:36:39 GMT):<br/>
I think about this as the SDKs within Fabric that were still under development even when the project was active. I do not think that an in development subproject should impact the Active/Incubation status. Again, has the community come together and figured out how to work in an open source manner to do releases. Given the diversity of Aries and the strength of the community, it seems like it meets the Active status.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 15:36:44 GMT):<br/>
+1 to Nathan.  More community involvement is almost always better.  We can leave it up to the project itself to police the quality of subprojects (potentially lower-quality subprojects would be the only downside of this amount of freedom).
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 15:37:40 GMT):<br/>
I think they have a little more work (for instance, their CII badging is not done).  But I agree that the community merits active status, which is the big point.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 15:39:56 GMT):<br/>
The main frameworks in Aries are doing quite well in terms of contributors, pace of development, and paying attention to common use cases and co-developing the spec to keep things interoperable.  When we have an sdk or framework that isn't doing well, my feeling is we are happy to recruit help for it and move it to "lab" or "deprecated" status if we cannot address its health
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 15:41:06 GMT):<br/>
If I recall correctly, we decided to mostly separate out code quality and community quality.  Code quality --> 1.0 release, community quality --> active status.  We can obviously change these, but we should clarify what everything means.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 15:41:35 GMT):<br/>
(There's no reason a project shouldn't be able to release multiple different codebases at multiple different qualities/states either).
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 15:46:03 GMT):<br/>
I'd also say a difference in aries has come from the contributor pool. In particular, some subprojects have initially focused more on Indy as their contributor pool came from there. This has also led to some initial differences with aries-framework-go's ledger-agnostic focus.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 15:47:16 GMT):<br/>
+1 to Sam.  The line between standards and interfaces can be very blurry.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 15:59:57 GMT):<br/>
"Pre-standards" ;)
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 21 Jan 2021 16:00:15 GMT):<br/>
I think having a space for "pre-standards" is important, particularly for aries.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:14:37 GMT):<br/>
I assume it's fine to comment on quarterly reports for a little bit and expect a response, even outside the TSC meeting.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:17:59 GMT):<br/>
I think so
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:19:36 GMT):<br/>
> Each repo will add the same repolint.json file and the CA team (or preferably CI) will periodically run a check to ensure projects are in compliance.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:24:45 GMT):<br/>
+1 to Arnaud (and Tracy).  We all need to do better implementing the decisions we have made.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:25:30 GMT):<br/>
But this goes back to the TSC not really having teeth for these things (or in some cases, the TSC really isn't strongly connected to some of the projects).
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:26:48 GMT):<br/>
Good idea @grace.hartley :) Let the TSC follow up, be the bad cop, say hi and get the things done.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:27:37 GMT):<br/>
I'll spend to day getting a github action running off of community tools and post a formal proposal for the next meeting to make the community tools json the master and to ensure automated checks (either via a copy of the json file or do a github action)
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:30:56 GMT):<br/>
What tools does the TSC have to incentivize things like this?
</p>
<p><strong>grace.hartley</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:31:13 GMT):<br/>
To confirm the actions from that convo so I'm following. Apologies if I'm missing something: 
1. There will be an email sent to the mainainters list reminding them of the decision and to update their repo structure
2. Any projects missing from the maintainer list will be reached out to directly. Ry/Grace to coordinate on this effort.
</p>
<p><strong>grace.hartley</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:32:24 GMT):<br/>
Incubation and active status seems to be one way. I think we could also think about how Danno's badging proposal fits in to the accountability or incentive plan.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:33:22 GMT):<br/>
Linking these changes to active status isn't necessarily a bad idea, but what about projects that aren't trying to achieve active status (which is most of our projects at this point)?  They still don't have any incentive to apply for active status.  I guess this is a good segue to our badging discussion.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:34:21 GMT):<br/>
+1 to Arnaud's comments. I like adding these specific questions to the quarterly reports:
1. Have you switched from master to main in all your repos
2. Have you implemented repolinter.json
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:34:38 GMT):<br/>
This is a good idea, but we need projects to want to achieve active status for this to work (which is not the case for many projects).  Maybe the badging process will make this better--you can lose your "HL Infrastructure approved" badge or something like that if you don't do this stuff by a deadline.
</p>
<p><strong>grace.hartley</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:36:04 GMT):<br/>
I like Mark's idea of giving them until March too.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:43:42 GMT):<br/>
I like Danno's overall strategy, but I'm worried that the challenge process could become arbitrarily adversarial (i.e. I challenge all of the projects' badges just to cause headaches) or oligarchic (my friends an I ignore each others' shortcomings).  Can we try to make most of the badging criteria immediately clear so that ambiguous challenges that become a matter of opinion are unlikely?
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:44:06 GMT):<br/>
Can we prepare a checkbox list for badges? A tool that auto suggests what badges a project gets.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:53:05 GMT):<br/>
Part of the discussion previously is that there should only be objective criteria for achieving a badge. This would imply that there should be no question/challenge.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:54:37 GMT):<br/>
Yeah.  My opinion is that challenges should generally follow actions.  For instance, if I want to use a project and find that documentation is years old, I might ask the maintainers for updated documentation.  If they don't have it (but maybe they have the documentation badge) that's when the badging can be discussed.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:56:20 GMT):<br/>
@adc The point of badging is essentially to replace the active/incubation project status.  It's to inform users of the projects about the state of the community around projects without them having to dig heavily into the details of the contributions.  We want projects to be able to convince outsiders (users, potential contributors) that they are healthy and trending in a positive direction.  The badging program (and the active status) are ways we try to address this.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:57:11 GMT):<br/>
I have an open question, is there a process setup for the project RFCs or is it that each project is free to choose their own format?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:57:26 GMT):<br/>
They are free to choose their own format.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:58:11 GMT):<br/>
Thanks Hart, I had an idea for the Aries project active status. Will post it in the quarterly report.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:59:47 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, my opinion is that Aries pretty clearly meets most of the metrics for active status (they still need to do some administrative things like CII badging, but the community requirements--the hardest ones--are in good shape).
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 16:01:40 GMT):<br/>
Agree, few questions I have around are to streamlining the documentation and setting up the stage for beginners.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 31 Jan 2021 23:27:30 GMT):<br/>
Hi - @swcurran has been asking good questions about `repolinter.json` - which version is canonical, etc. @lehors do you have the version/setup that you're using available?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 00:31:16 GMT):<br/>
Specifically noted that the referenced repolinter.json in Fabric is in a closed PR that was never merged.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 00:33:01 GMT):<br/>
Separate technical question is what to do with these warnings found when run on the Aries Cloud Agent Python (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python) repo.

Specifically -- why did the python, license and apache-2 messages come up when the repo is python, has a license and is apache-2?

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 10:50:19 GMT):<br/>

Different results from using that `repolint.js` file, but running it naively from the instructions in the repolinter repo had new errors. Anyone know how to resolve?  I've removed ones I understand:

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 01 Feb 2021 16:12:06 GMT):<br/>
The one I don't get is why the repo is not detected as python.  I expect the rest.  Also, the Axiom errors.

Would setting up project to project meetings be something that people are interested in doing?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 15:13:31 GMT):<br/>
My experience is that the maintainers care little about the TSC stuff (badging, active status) and are just interested in building stuff.  So, at least for the projects that I work with, I don't think we'd get a lot of interested people if we focused on TSC business.

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 15:24:54 GMT):<br/>
I'm working on setting up repolint based on the labs rules, but I noticed that some changes will be needed. E.g., GitHub Actions detection for CI, sub-pathed node_modules, exclusion for additional vendored files license headers.
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 15:25:40 GMT):<br/>
Some of those are generic fixes, but vendored files can be more project specific.

Personally, I think whatever we can come up with badging will be less broken than the active/incubation dichotomy.  So thanks @shemnon for driving this issue!
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 17:18:25 GMT):<br/>
I argue that, instead of sending @swcurran on a fool's errand, the TSC should have an email vote to suspend that requirement, or make it a "should".
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 17:20:52 GMT):<br/>
I agree.  But we vote directly on active status anyway, right?  It's the TSC's interpretation of whether or not these properties are satisfied or not.  So we can just ignore it?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 17:21:43 GMT):<br/>
sure; however, there is non-zero time being spent on trying to comply with a requirement that can't today be met.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 17:22:25 GMT):<br/>
maybe "until this is fixed, this specific requirement is a should"
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 17:22:30 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, that's true.  I agree.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 17:23:15 GMT):<br/>
I guess it isn't in here: https://tsc.hyperledger.org/project-incubation-exit.html

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 17:25:11 GMT):<br/>
It is by reference: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/TSC/Common+Repo+structure
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 17:25:23 GMT):<br/>
What fool's errand am I on?  FYI - we have a do have a document in process to request exiting incubation -- https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=41591994
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 17:27:11 GMT):<br/>
I meant that you're spending time trying to resolve questions about repolinter that can't be answered today. You're right, it isn't a fool's errand; I think it is unfair to require that projects meet requirements that aren't agreed on how to meet.
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 18:16:02 GMT):<br/>
I was able to work around all of the quirks on repolinter and have a PR out for Fabric: https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/pull/2366
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 18:16:35 GMT):<br/>
This did involve me publishing the image for repolinter myself, I needed to pull the entrypoint out of the Dockerfile to make it compatible with Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 18:17:09 GMT):<br/>
So projects can make use of it by using the image at `hyperledger-tools.jfrog.io/repolinter:0.10.0`
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 18:18:04 GMT):<br/>
I intentionally tagged it as the GitHub tag I built it from so people can debug why it might now be working for their use case by seeing whats changed since that tag was released
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 18:21:45 GMT):<br/>
Is the entrypoint for that docker image the same?  i.e. are the env vars expected compatible?
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 18:23:27 GMT):<br/>
Yea, nothing was edited other than to remove the entrypoint which was `bundle exec /app/bin/repolinter.js`
</p>
<p><strong>BrettLogan</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 18:24:02 GMT):<br/>
Instead we call `bundle exec /app/bin/repolinter.js` as the command executed in the container by CI
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 18:24:12 GMT):<br/>
I think I can make that work as a github action.

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 04 Feb 2021 19:31:20 GMT):<br/>
This docker container has the axioms pre-installed, so it's superior to the action I was forking off of that manually installed repolint.

@shemnon Danno, I hadn't seen your PR and I submitted one that fixed the test for the Maintainers file that has been merged. As a result your PR has a conflict. Sorry about that. Could you please rebase it so we can merge it and move forward? https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-community-management-tools/pull/54
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 18:47:23 GMT):<br/>
@BrettLogan pointed out that the repolint.json file is badly formatted and hard to read, I'd like to reformat it but prefer doing that with a dedicated PR so that we get a clean slate before doing further changes
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Tue, 09 Feb 2021 18:48:18 GMT):<br/>
but I don't want to do that and create more conflicts with your PR that has been sitting there for days (I wonder why)
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 11 Feb 2021 01:34:48 GMT):<br/>
The Aries Community would like the TSC to formally consider our request to exit incubation as soon as possible.  Please let us know what we can do to move that forward as some in the community would really to see that as they are active in presenting the project to newcomers to the concepts.

The document written about this is here: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=41591994

The only questions we had about the document relates to the following

1. Legal checking on the trademark (who does that)?
2. What is required for documenting alignment with the Hyperledger Architecture?   There was a link to a page that really didn't provide much guidance on that.

Thanks

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 11 Feb 2021 15:06:51 GMT):<br/>
Are we going to discuss the Aries active status proposal?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 11 Feb 2021 15:12:32 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon We've tried to do this in our quarterly reports--either list some things we're working on to get to active status, or list some bottlenecks as to why we aren't there.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 11 Feb 2021 15:13:08 GMT):<br/>
My thought is it should be an explicit question for incubating projects.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 11 Feb 2021 15:13:49 GMT):<br/>
I guess maybe we should add it to the quarterly reports then?  That seems like the easiest way to get reporting on this question.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 11 Feb 2021 15:17:58 GMT):<br/>
Can we roll this into the project badging discussion?  It might make more sense to work on it in this context if we are going to overhaul active/incubation anyway.  Some explanation on unsatisfied badges might be nice.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 11 Feb 2021 15:22:43 GMT):<br/>
I agree that bumping this up to formal standards groups in the long run is the best idea.  The problem is that these bodies are incredibly slow and we need something in the short to mid term.  It seems like everyone here agrees with this though.

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 11 Feb 2021 15:37:34 GMT):<br/>
Can we do a "sponsor matching" initiative?  One of the best things about sponsors is seemingly that they can help people looking to join Hyperledger get accustomed to how HL works, including the many unwritten laws that the organization follows.  Apache, if I recall correctly, as a "champion" role for up and coming projects (or something like that) that helps the project with the community.  Having a labs sponsor fulfill a similar role would be great.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 11 Feb 2021 15:42:48 GMT):<br/>
We have a hackathon rolling in next month, few participants have reached out asking if their submissions can be added to labs. I am happy to review those proposals and get them onto labs.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 11 Feb 2021 15:45:32 GMT):<br/>
In the Apache incubator they're called mentors: https://incubator.apache.org/
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 11 Feb 2021 15:48:05 GMT):<br/>
What about the following:  we eliminate sponsors in general.  But we require that if a new labs project does not have any existing HL contributors, we appoint them a "mentor."
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 11 Feb 2021 15:48:15 GMT):<br/>
Can we point to those new proposers to a link or mailing list? That way they have people noticing their willingness.
</p>
<p><strong>Bobbijn</strong> (Thu, 11 Feb 2021 15:48:45 GMT):<br/>
The sponsor's role as community liaison between developers and the Hyperledger Labs should occur before the project is in the labs , Letting the developers know there is a place for their work.

<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 11 Feb 2021 15:53:42 GMT):<br/>
Given the time I suggest the Labs stewards put forward a proposal for the next TSC call - and if it's just to do away with sponsors, great, but show how Labs will document what's required and perform the required oversight.
</p>
<p><strong>Bobbijn</strong> (Thu, 11 Feb 2021 15:55:36 GMT):<br/>
Here is a space to collect our thought: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/LMDWG/Lab+Sponsors+Proposal
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 11 Feb 2021 15:56:23 GMT):<br/>
The sponsor requirement was a 1:1 map to the mentor model in the Apache incubator, and to lessen the burden on the Labs stewards to perform that necessary oversight

bug	Indicates an unexpected problem or unintended behavior
documentation	Indicates a need for improvements or additions to documentation
duplicate	Indicates similar issues or pull requests
enhancement	Indicates new feature requests
good first issue	Indicates a good issue for first-time contributors

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 15:31:32 GMT):<br/>
Can we have a list of potential sponsors for SIGs/labs/whatever with a description of what kinds of projects that particular sponsor might be interested in?  This might be a way to get more people to volunteer--they would only get projects in areas that they're interested in working, which might increase participation.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 15:34:59 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 15:58:15 GMT):<br/>
@lehors Same here.  We've been fighting this in projects as well.  I also get really frustrated when people close PRs from non-familiar people without commenting, which is something some of our maintainers have done as well.  I think this is pretty much a universal Hyperledger thing as well.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 15:58:39 GMT):<br/>
the auto-close bots are an anti-pattern.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 16:06:22 GMT):<br/>
I haven't seen maintainers close PRs right off the bat but I've seen it happen after a PR was ignored long enough that the submitter had disappeared and nobody was around anymore to respond to any comments or requests for changes
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 16:06:34 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 19 Feb 2021 03:51:59 GMT):<br/>
Yep, that's basically the exact issue I had in mind.  Someone new does a PR that's not perfect (but well-intentioned and certainly not useless), but maintainers don't respond for a while.  There is then minimal effort to reach out to the person.
</p>

no, I think if you start with a copy of the page created with the duplicate function that works, what you can't do is create the page via copy-paste of its content because that will lost its "magic"

So when we speak of diversity we speak of people correct?  DE&I meanings?  I'd like us to move "corporate diversity" to a different word to increase clarity.  I propose "decentralized" as it encompasses both the meaning and the intended value of "corporate diversity."

I feel auto-close bots are an anti-pattern
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 15:54:08 GMT):<br/>
Not necessarily to have auto-close
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 15:54:14 GMT):<br/>
But we can have auto-remind bots

Putting metrics around PR age incentivizes stuff like "Stale Bots" and "PR Bankruptcy" - https://twitter.com/headius/status/1367116838283464708
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 15:55:49 GMT):<br/>
Not a reason to not do PR ages stats, but we need to be mindful of the follow on effects.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 04 Mar 2021 15:56:37 GMT):<br/>
For example: if stale bots do emerge we should have a metric around stale bot closures, and view it as a negative.
</p>

I wasn't around when burrow got approved as a project, but unless there's a governing boar waiver I view this as a legit error.  I don't see anything in Section 12 of the Hyperledger Charter that permits dual (as in pick one) outbound licensing.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 13 Mar 2021 16:04:20 GMT):<br/>
12.b does have some room for interpretation, but a strict reading is apache 2.0 and only apache 2.0
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Sat, 13 Mar 2021 16:46:07 GMT):<br/>
aha
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Sat, 13 Mar 2021 16:49:07 GMT):<br/>
well, I don't mind relicensing under apache-2.0 only, apart from the legal side of getting contributers to ok this.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Sat, 13 Mar 2021 16:50:41 GMT):<br/>
Having said that, the rule "b. All outbound code will be made available under the Apache License, Version 2.0." is certainly met. The code is available under the apache license, version 2.0.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Sat, 13 Mar 2021 16:54:35 GMT):<br/>
Having said that, I think @shemnon is taking a very strict reading of this. Solang is available under the apache license.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Sat, 13 Mar 2021 16:54:51 GMT):<br/>
What's the best way to proceed?
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Sat, 13 Mar 2021 16:55:21 GMT):<br/>
It never occurred to me that this would be a problem.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sat, 13 Mar 2021 17:32:28 GMT):<br/>
@bbehlendorf thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Sat, 13 Mar 2021 17:35:08 GMT):<br/>
I admit that my reading may be too strict, and I'm willing to be wrong on it.  But I think it needs to be clarified and this is a good test case.

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 15 Mar 2021 14:48:47 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon I don't know if dual-licensed code is allowed. I know the board has made some decisions around this in the past.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Mon, 15 Mar 2021 15:39:56 GMT):<br/>
If dual-licensed code is not allowed, what is the process for re-licensing to apache-only?
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Mon, 15 Mar 2021 16:49:17 GMT):<br/>
So there's a difference between inbound license (prior works under their own license, as well as individual contributions) and outbound license (what is published as e.g. LICENSE.md or otherwise depended upon). With the former, it has to either be Apache, or an Apache-compatible variant such as MIT (though if it's a lot of MIT-ish code without the patent protections, that really deserves TSC and GB attention, can explain further later). Outbound, it must be Apache. Our downstream users and contributors depend upon the patent protection, and there is no extra value to using MIT, but more basically it's what we say all our code is under.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Mon, 15 Mar 2021 16:50:06 GMT):<br/>
Process for "re-licensing" outbound to Apache-only should be to just change that license text.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Mon, 15 Mar 2021 16:51:13 GMT):<br/>
Obviously, don't change the license text associated with inbound contributions, e.g. something that exists on a vendor branch or was imported some way other than via a developer's original contribution under a DCO.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 15 Mar 2021 16:58:44 GMT):<br/>
@seanyoung
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Mon, 15 Mar 2021 17:08:23 GMT):<br/>
@bbehlendorf thanks, that's clear. I'll update the LICENSE file, and that should be it.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Mon, 15 Mar 2021 18:07:41 GMT):<br/>
I've updated Solang license file: https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang/pull/401

Now repolinter passes. :innocent:
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 18 Mar 2021 14:10:19 GMT):<br/>
Sorry about this.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 18 Mar 2021 14:10:41 GMT):<br/>
Please continue
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 18 Mar 2021 14:13:46 GMT):<br/>
I just wanted to point out that burrow now also has ewasm support. This means that with Solang, we can compile Solidity and run it on burrow -- it works end to end. This will also work with other ewasm tooling.

Since Fabric, Sawtooth, and Iroha already use the burrow evm implementation, merging ewasm support as well would be easy. This would bring ewasm and Solang support to those ledgers.

How do people feel about "mature" or some other synonym for "adult"?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 18 Mar 2021 14:33:27 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Mar 2021 14:36:19 GMT):<br/>
I think Tracy's point is that it's hard to get the current people to update to the modern terms, which confuses the new people because there is an official set of terms, but the actual people use some other set of terms.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Mar 2021 14:43:10 GMT):<br/>
I think I hold the consensus opinion:  n a vacuum, "graduated" is much better than "active."  The question is 1) is it worth it to replace legacy terms, perhaps confusing new people, mostly when old people don't use the new terms and 2) what does the new label mean with respect to the badging system.  Is this indeed what people think?

@shemnon "Premier" project isn't a bad idea--we could tie other things to it, like documentation, marketing obligations, etc. that are currently difficult to force projects to do.  We could also let "ecosystems" apply for premier status jointly (i.e. Indy/Aries) which might also help us simplify the greenhouse diagram.  Not sure how others will feel about this though...
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 18 Mar 2021 14:47:23 GMT):<br/>
My thinking for "Premier" is that it is a status that has to be maintained, and if the standards are not met the status reverts to whatever is past incubation.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Mar 2021 14:48:44 GMT):<br/>
I agree that it should be something that should have to be maintained.  But I also think it would be useful to add additional community requirements that currently aren't required by active status, but would be very nice (e.g. documentation, marketing, "enough" maintainers attending relevant HL events, etc.).
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 18 Mar 2021 14:49:37 GMT):<br/>
Yep.  Above and beyond incubation exit.  Perhaps an "adoption" badge as well to show that the project is used "in the wild"
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 18 Mar 2021 14:50:17 GMT):<br/>
We would have to collaborate with he marketing committee, but perhaps each "premier" project gets a marketing push once a year.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Mar 2021 14:50:24 GMT):<br/>
We need some way to quantify "adoption", but yes.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Mar 2021 14:51:19 GMT):<br/>
Right.  I would imagine that the idea behind premier project would be sort of "you have invested in the HL community, so HL will help you in return with marketing, etc."
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Thu, 18 Mar 2021 14:52:03 GMT):<br/>
i really like the shadow program idea.  could apply for a range of community roles and not just for release managers.  like a maintainer shadow program.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Mar 2021 14:52:15 GMT):<br/>
It should be totally acceptable for a project to not aim for premier status (if it doesn't want or need marketing--i.e. libraries) and a positive side effect would be for us to simplify the greenhouse effect.

Repolinter and Go repos common warning: source-license-headers-exist: Did not find file matching the specified patterns. (due to rules being for JavaScript).

+1 to Danno.  What most people ultimately want with blockchain is a "database with decentralized trust" and don't need a "pure" blockchain.  This would help them achieve that more easily.

<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Thu, 25 Mar 2021 14:25:08 GMT):<br/>

I am searching for current proposal that says DCO is must for PR, or is it more mentioned that it is before merge.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 25 Mar 2021 14:42:34 GMT):<br/>
It is in the charter
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 25 Mar 2021 14:43:53 GMT):<br/>
And force pushing the repo after a PR is merged is very problematic.

Fire up the VSCode github interface and try to sign off a commit
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 25 Mar 2021 14:46:28 GMT):<br/>
*IF* DCO is required on the commit, my point is that we really need tooling to enforce this. I don't think rewriting the repo when it gets noticed is an acceptable solution.

Intellectual Property
"All contributions shall be accompanied by a Developer Certificate of Origin sign-off (http://developercertificate.org) that is submitted through a Governing Board and LF-approved contribution process. "
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 25 Mar 2021 14:47:29 GMT):<br/>
I still am surprised that we can legally allow fully anonymous contributions (i.e. where the LF doesn't even know the contributor).
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 25 Mar 2021 14:48:19 GMT):<br/>
Looks like we would need both TSC and Governing Board approval to change

<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 25 Mar 2021 14:51:55 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, it suggests contributions. It does not clearly say PR shall be blocked before merging (but it is kind of understood). So, no hard comments on having flexibility and adding responsibility on maintainers.

<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 25 Mar 2021 14:56:46 GMT):<br/>
If issues are tagged as e.g. "bite-sized" in GH, one queries against that, and thus even a confluence page doesn't need to be maintained?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 25 Mar 2021 14:57:06 GMT):<br/>
yes, sort of

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 25 Mar 2021 17:32:09 GMT):<br/>
One thing I learned durring my internet searches is that the Chef project already has a similar policy.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Mon, 05 Apr 2021 14:10:44 GMT):<br/>
Going back to the conversation on automating the badge generation, @bbehlendorf you told there can be support available from the LF team. Is that correct understanding? It will help if we can revive this discussion.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 14:09:39 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, if we can get rid of that in the template, it'd be great.  Thanks Ry!
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 14:12:15 GMT):<br/>
Done

@rjones what's the discussed remediation without git history re-write?

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 14:20:08 GMT):<br/>
This seems to me like it would rule out anonymous contributions (and our current process).  Are other people reading it the same way?

<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 14:21:12 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 14:21:42 GMT):<br/>
No, I read it as - as long as there is a DCO (with a fake ID rather be it), it is accepted.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 14:30:03 GMT):<br/>
@hartm : Are you referring to this sentence"Such contribution process will include steps to also bind non-Member Contributors and, if not self-employed, their employer, to the licenses expressly granted in the Apache License, Version 2.0 with respect to such contribution." This somewhat says that you have to know who the person is and who they work for.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 14:30:36 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt :  Yep, I was.  It's a bit vague though.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 14:31:13 GMT):<br/>
I (informally, doesn't count as legal advice) spoke with a patent attorney about our process--it's definitely in the gray area.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 14:31:21 GMT):<br/>
And a bit confusing that it is trying to differentiate member contributors vs. non-member contributors. I do not know what agreements are signed by the member agreements.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 14:32:09 GMT):<br/>
I definitely agree.  I think it'd be best if we had a good lawyer come in and tell us exactly what we need to do here, but I don't know what we need to do to trigger that process.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 14:33:16 GMT):<br/>
(And, obviously, rewrite this section of the charter.)

</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 14:55:45 GMT):<br/>
do we need to consider how we "protect" Hyperledger ? Is that part of the Lab Stewarts role ?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 14:58:11 GMT):<br/>
As someone who has sponsored a bunch of labs, it has caused me to read through a bunch of labs and I've even reconnected with some old collaborators over sponsoring a labs proposal.  But I think this is the exception rather than the norm.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 15:01:19 GMT):<br/>
As I recollect, the motivation for labs sponsors was to help stop the labs being a dumping ground (in particular, a sponsor may have expertise in an area that the stewards don't) and also increase ties to the rest of the community.  I'm not 100% sure this is correct, but I believe there was even a proposal at the time of labs creation to require that you had to be an existing contributor to propose a lab (which is much stronger than what we currently have).  This was rejected.
</p>
<p><strong>mwagner</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 15:02:21 GMT):<br/>
the labs are essentially a black hole from my POV. perhaps the lab stewards could provide a quarterly report type of summary abot the labs ?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 15:09:51 GMT):<br/>
@mwagner there is supposed to be a report every quarter, but I stopped doing it. I also pointed out a bunch of labs that should be archived, but that didn't happen.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 15:44:55 GMT):<br/>
wait, @rjones, you seem to be saying we have never archived any labs, that's not correct, is it?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 15:50:46 GMT):<br/>
@lehors no. I'm saying I brought to the attention of the stewards a bunch of labs that needed archiving, and it didn't happen, so I stopped looking.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 15:51:23 GMT):<br/>
I didn't know you stopped looking
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 15:51:30 GMT):<br/>
I thought we responded when you brought them up
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 15:51:31 GMT):<br/>
@lehors [here was my report](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/labs?msg=LPMktT7vuFRZfWB3T) and nobody acted on it.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 15:51:46 GMT):<br/>
and when we moved some back out of archival
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 15:51:48 GMT):<br/>
by acted, I mean, took up making a PR and filing it.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 15:52:58 GMT):<br/>
ok, so maybe you didn't nag us enough on that one :)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 15:53:30 GMT):<br/>
that was the nag :) I'm trying to push Lab Stewards to do more Stewarding
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 15:54:13 GMT):<br/>
I'm in favor of being pretty relaxed about this and archive fairly easily given that we can always restore them
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 15:56:00 GMT):<br/>
It looks like the last time [I did a lab update was H2 2019](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/labs/Hyperledger+Labs+Updates).
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 15:56:53 GMT):<br/>
yeah, maybe we should have a reminder like we have for the projects
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 15:57:03 GMT):<br/>
at least twice a year or so
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 15:58:02 GMT):<br/>
Maybe I should be more clear: I want the Lab Stewards to own this process of archiving and providing reports to the TSC. The reports should be easier now with Insights.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 15:58:29 GMT):<br/>
I understand and don't disagree with the proposal
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 15:58:55 GMT):<br/>
I'm just saying having reminders would help make it happen
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 15:59:12 GMT):<br/>
it's not like I have intentionally decided not to do it
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 08 Apr 2021 16:00:01 GMT):<br/>
Understood. I guess I could add these reminders to the Labs mailing list calendar, but any moderator could also do that.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 09 Apr 2021 13:09:52 GMT):<br/>
I submitted a PR to change the name "Active" to "Graduated" in the TSC documentation: https://github.com/hyperledger/tsc/pull/7
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 09 Apr 2021 13:11:27 GMT):<br/>
In doing so I noticed that we still have the old wiki page around: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/TSC/Project+Lifecycle
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 09 Apr 2021 13:12:31 GMT):<br/>
The content of this page should be yanked and replaced with a link pointing to the new location and *please* DO NOT make this "Go here". See https://lehors.wordpress.com/2009/01/29/linking-the-proper-way/
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 09 Apr 2021 13:13:26 GMT):<br/>
I would also appreciate if the link on that page could be updated: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Project+Lifecycle
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 09 Apr 2021 13:14:13 GMT):<br/>
although one should probably simply redirect to the other

<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 09 Apr 2021 13:14:23 GMT):<br/>
note: I don't have permission to edit these pages
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Apr 2021 15:22:06 GMT):<br/>
@lehors [is this better](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Project+Lifecycle) ?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Apr 2021 15:22:38 GMT):<br/>
or would you prefer a redirect as well?
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Fri, 09 Apr 2021 15:40:46 GMT):<br/>
very good! Thank you. :-)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Fri, 09 Apr 2021 16:07:37 GMT):<br/>
@lehors [here you go](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/TSC/Project+Lifecycle) for the second one
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 14:43:21 GMT):<br/>
There have been Cactus-Weaver conversations as Arnaud alluded to.  In particular, while some of the techniques used are different, there are parts of the codebases that are similar or that could be made more similar, such as the "ledger connectors."  Some of these components would be good targets for "de facto standardization."  We plan to have more discussion on what to do in the future.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 14:49:53 GMT):<br/>
I'm fine if stewards want to appoint "champions" or "guides" or something like that to help projects out.

</p>
<p><strong>anilkumargr</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 18:02:00 GMT):<br/>
Could you please help me understand this report
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 18:03:00 GMT):<br/>
1) there is no code of conduct file - take a look at Besu, for instance, that has the correct CoC file
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 18:03:44 GMT):<br/>
2) if you look at the warnings, it says a NOTICE file is missing, which is only a warning.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 18:04:11 GMT):<br/>
3) it also says a bunch of files are missing copyright headers - please add the correct SPDX header to those files
</p>
<p><strong>anilkumargr</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 18:04:44 GMT):<br/>
ooh ok, got it
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 18:05:41 GMT):<br/>
you should be able to run it on your desktop to see what needs fixed
</p>
<p><strong>anilkumargr</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 18:06:37 GMT):<br/>
I am new to the Hyperledger team, so please excuse me if I am asking a silly question. Could you please point me to the repo I can look at to see how the correct files look.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 18:11:43 GMT):<br/>
no worries at all!
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 18:12:45 GMT):<br/>
If you look at [the action I use to make the reports](https://github.com/ryjones/rl-report/blob/cbc4167926e1924f23d456358ff0e7be7219166b/.github/workflows/main.yml#L13) you will see the docker image you need.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 18:13:35 GMT):<br/>
Then you'll need to [run something like I do](https://github.com/ryjones/rl-report/blob/cbc4167926e1924f23d456358ff0e7be7219166b/.github/workflows/main.yml#L17) , but you'll need to point it at your local repo
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 15 Apr 2021 18:16:37 GMT):<br/>
@anilkumargr it would look something like this: `bundle exec /app/bin/repolinter.js --rulesetUrl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-community-management-tools/master/repo_structure/repolint.json --format markdown -g your-repo.git`

@lehors  In my experience, very few maintainers pay attention to the TSC mailing list.  This might be a symptom of our lack of cross-project coordination.

This is a message from Elisabeth Greene in Zoom chat: ```I'm in the US with a flexible schedule, MS biomedical engineering Duke U. Other languages include Fortran & SAS in 1979, Turbo Pascal in 1988, HTML in 2000, and Python in 2017.

<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:15:10 GMT):<br/>
Do we know if somebody is using Quilt?
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:15:17 GMT):<br/>
What is the demand/usage metric?

</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:17:09 GMT):<br/>
Archiving solely for the reason for not having additional developers - is tough action. Activeness status (either through badge or a state) can help.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:18:02 GMT):<br/>
Attic does seem to be equal to end-of-life: "The Apache Attic was created in November 2008 to provide process and solutions to make it clear when an Apache project has reached its end of life. Specifically to be: "
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:22:43 GMT):<br/>
Attic has a path out.  We lack that path.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:23:09 GMT):<br/>
Our EOL state should have that path. Right to fork says it's always implicit
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:23:13 GMT):<br/>
Can we just give deprecated projects a path out?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:24:53 GMT):<br/>
Perhaps rename Incubation to Admitted, Deprecated to "on-hold", and allow Deprecated/"on-hold" and end-of-like to go back to Incubating/"admitted" via similar vetting to a new project entering Incubating/"Admitted"?
</p>
<p><strong>troyronda</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:25:27 GMT):<br/>
dormant :)
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:25:53 GMT):<br/>
What if we add a clause to deprecated saying that "if contributor levels rise to the level that meet the requirements of a project in incudbation, the project can be moved back to the incubation stage" or something like that?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:26:13 GMT):<br/>
@troyronda "Dormant" is a great word choice.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:26:26 GMT):<br/>
More clear than on-hold.
</p>
<p><strong>grace.hartley</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:28:01 GMT):<br/>
I agree with this. 100% projects that are deprecated can apply for incubated again if their status changes.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 14:32:05 GMT):<br/>
The concept of "promoted release" sort of died due to the reality of the marketing org handling what releases got promoted and how rather than the TSC.

I have couple of open questions
1. I see a Hyperledger brand survey blog circulated, is it initiated by The LF or is it done for helping the whitepaper TF?
2. New project proposal and asking for contributions on CBDC. Not sure where and how is this initiated. More information on this will help.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 14:13:45 GMT):<br/>
1. initiated by Hyperledger staff and the marketing committee to better understand public perception. Happy to share what comes out of that with the whitepaper TF and the TSC.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 14:16:41 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 14:16:42 GMT):<br/>
2. Similarly, HL staff sent a call out to HL members based on a sense that there are many emerging CBDC efforts building on top of HL ledgers, and we thought it would help everyone if those efforts could align around a common code base. We'll see!

So, can I consider firefly having 2 parts

2. Data plane components - that deals with offchain exchange of data. I heard more about this in the meeting.

It's a little more challenging to assess whether the project would be successful in Hyperledger because it doesn't have an open source history.

</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 15:04:13 GMT):<br/>
and to be fair although I think all projects were open sourced before coming to Hyperledger, at least early on, we mostly went on based on public commitments than an actual track record of a diverse community of contributors

@troyronda thanks for your questions on the TSC call today, I'd like to follow up further on your last question about DID, as I was starting to respond I saw the clock was running out so I took a short cut ;-) what I didn't get to say was that Firefly will have out of box organizational identities supported via a registry, for both verifying message signatures as well as encrypting message payloads, which is extensible. Firefly will provide both x509 certs based and ethereum address based identities to work with the underlying blockchain protocols. for user level identities within a member app (using their Firefly node as the back end), we tend to leave that for each applications to decide (oauth based, or DID). I should've asked which type of identities you meant for your question.
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 16:06:02 GMT):<br/>
I've also added a response to your comment in the proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GR-YSlGPlVNpMIyikk9EJciTyrO2INwMpR9vrOrcbP0/edit?disco=AAAAMIywnIc

<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 16:25:28 GMT):<br/>
given that Firefly is fundamentally a decentralized event based architecture, I would tend to think there is no control plane sitting above them. you might consider the blockchain to be a "coordination plane" that sits beneath the instances that is responsible for network-wide concerns: policies, memberships, consistent data schema (where appropriate).
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 16:28:42 GMT):<br/>
I think "data plane" is a good mental model for the "Firefly node" described in the proposal, that encapsulates the offchain processing logic, data storage, and data exchanges
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 22:30:52 GMT):<br/>
For firefly there will be a licensing hurdle to overcome.  Both ethconnect and firefly-cli use go-ethereum, which is LGPL3, and the firefly-ui has some use (via nested deps no doubt) of WTFPL which has problematic patent implications.  I think those can be resolved with use of yarn and resolutions as the only WTFPL only lib went to MIT in a later version.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 22:31:47 GMT):<br/>
The go-ethereum deps are the more concerning, as I have seen the geth authors make public statements regarding some projects that re-licensed go-ethereum that they cannot do it and need to stay GPL.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 13 May 2021 22:32:42 GMT):<br/>
firefly "core" looks to be in better shape.

thanks for raising this Danno, licensing is an area we paid attention to from the very beginning because we have always wanted to have an enterprise friendly license with our code (Apache 2.0 in particular). since the "library" part of go-ethereum is under LGPL 3.0, as opposed to the "binary" being GPL, we should be in good standing since ethconnect only uses the geth library and it's a standalone runtime. As long as customers refrain from linking to ethconnect from a commercial component (which is not what ethconnect is intended for anyway), there shouldn't be any issues.

</p>
<p><strong>peterbroadhurst</strong> (Fri, 14 May 2021 11:18:31 GMT):<br/>
Just to add that the ethconnect component that links to LGPL code, is a separate optional runtime "remote agent" to FireFly core (and none of those issues exist in the core).

The runtime plugin model of the project is designed to help with these types of isolation boundaries. Runtime HA, code language (runtimes like this can be Java etc. - as needed for Corda for example), and licensing.

</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Fri, 14 May 2021 14:18:30 GMT):<br/>
Because the Go code is statically linked (all in one file) and there is no alternative library, the connector may still be subject to the GPL vitality clauses (this should be run by lawyers, my opinions are not legal advice). 

If the ethconnect does not come into hyperledger repos then the license clause won't be a concern. But this seems like a foundational component and it would be problematic to leave out IMHO.
</p>
<p><strong>nguyer</strong> (Mon, 17 May 2021 14:41:23 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for pointing this out. Just wanted to follow up and note that GPL, LGPL, and WTFPL dependencies have been removed from both firefly-cli and firefly-ui now.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Mon, 17 May 2021 15:40:01 GMT):<br/>
how about ethconnect? Are there non-copyleft ABI libraries in Go?  How hard would it be to write a Apache2 version of what is needed?
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 18 May 2021 03:53:18 GMT):<br/>
can you elaborate on your concern with using the LGPL licensed geth code as unmodified library (which is what we are doing in ethconnect)? our reasoning is pretty straightforward: 
- the code is LGPL (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum#license)
- the gist of LGPL is if the software is *modified*, then the modifications (fixes, enhancements) must be shared back
- ethconnect is using geth lib as-is without making any modifications (this is different than what Quorum is doing which is modifying geth code significantly), thus per LGPL the larger work (ethconnect) can be licensed differently
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 18 May 2021 03:54:16 GMT):<br/>
but of course OSS licensing can be complex so we'd like to make sure we get this right. looking forward to hearing more details from you

Please read the license. The LGPL discusses dynamic linking and "works that use the library."

My understanding is that the Gist of the Mozilla license focuses on not modifying the code, whereas the gits of the LGPL is based on '90s shared library patterns where the libraries were shipped separately from the applications.

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 18 May 2021 13:29:36 GMT):<br/>
Not a lawyer (and we should have lawyers review this) but my concern is because Golang take the entire LGPL source code of the relevant functions used to compile the ethconenct binary and create object code from the LGPL code it becomes a deriviative work under the terms of the LGPL, or a gray area. Whereas if it read the API signatures from a header file and then used a separately provided object file to either dynamically link to at runtime or bundle the object code into a single binary then it would be a program that uses the library.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Tue, 18 May 2021 13:29:53 GMT):<br/>
Golang is not a good fit for the LGPL as written.  MPL is a better fit.

Closing out this thread, for now on this licensing question we'll await word from kaleido on the strategy for addressing the license issue with this piece, which if there's any question about linking and LGPL at that point we can pass it by LF legal for an opinion. And all that can happen separate from the approval of Firefly as a HL project.

@adc indeed had a valid question on privacy implications of using a token to represent entitlement and global uniqueness (no double spend) of the off-chain asset. This is a pretty complex topic and an open discussion outside of the TSC calls would be preferable to make sure the concerns are fully addressed.

This is a complicated topic indeed.  I think the big point being made is that it's important to be careful of exactly what you claim.  If you say your system has "full privacy" or something of that nature, then users will interpret that to mean it leaks absolutely nothing and use the system accordingly.

at a high level you can choose whether to use a token to represent the off-chain message/doc or not, it's not always a requirement for the asset to be globally unique, as long as the sender and receiver both got cryptographic proof of the fact of the exchange (by both sides providing signatures over the hash of the content). in which case the pinning tx can be simply recording the hashes (and can be submitted from a random signing account).
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 01 Jun 2021 01:20:36 GMT):<br/>
but if double spend protection is indeed needed, one can add protection of privacy leakage by submitting fake txs as noise. since the input of the txs are hashes, external parties can't tell if they were for real message/doc exchanges or not.
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 01 Jun 2021 01:20:56 GMT):<br/>
but definitely agree with the point about being precise with the language
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 01 Jun 2021 01:21:18 GMT):<br/>
I unfortunately speak from experience with this...
</p>
<p><strong>jimthematrix</strong> (Tue, 01 Jun 2021 01:25:38 GMT):<br/>
we will take another pass over the content and pay special attention to the language around privacy to make sure when we say "full privacy" we refer to cases of implementing with advanced cryptography via the plugin system. and feedback from cryptography experts like yourself @hartm and @adc are critical to make sure they adhere to the community standards and conventions

Having a landing place for the project will help to get in more folks/collaboration. Should it be a Labs or Hyperledger is the question.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 14:38:43 GMT):<br/>
My comments on it: Either is good enough. This is first of its kind project within Hyperledger, so having a space in Hyperledger would get more participation from community working in this space. Collaboration may continue there.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 14:38:47 GMT):<br/>
@lehors I definitely agree that convergence is the ideal solution (as you could probably guess).  The question is, will it actually happen, or are we being overidealistic?  I think you have to have strong champions and projects that are willing to make some short-term sacrifices for this to happen.  While I try to make sure that the projects I work on have this willingness (e.g. interop and Cactus), is it safe to assume in general?
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 14:41:08 GMT):<br/>
My take: It sounds like it's a bit early to promote firefly to a project.  Tabling and letting firefly operate as a labs project 2-6 months in labs I think is what is needed to solidify the project's open source practices.  I think convergence is worth looking into, but should not be blocking on either of the two projects mentioned.  My main concern is that the project hasn't had much time as open source and that time would help shake out any issues.  I expect after time in labs the vote to project status will be anti-climatic.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 14:45:29 GMT):<br/>
@bbehlendorf The codebases for BIF and ConnectionChain (the precursors to Cactus) were actually in real-world use cases before Cactus.
</p>
<p><strong>bbehlendorf</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 14:47:28 GMT):<br/>
Yep, as I thought, though they were still characterized as early
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 14:47:31 GMT):<br/>
It seems clear there is interest in having a project in this space.  Just a question of how well we can get folks collaborating and working together.  I leave it to those maintainers to work out which code bases are most mature and fit for purpose for what they are trying to accomplish.   I am looking to the fabric maintainers to express what makes most sense here as these efforts seem to be most closely related to their framework.  If it had gone to vote prior to today’s discussion I would have easily approved.  Now I am more confused—are these other efforts the same or not?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 14:47:40 GMT):<br/>
That's definitely true.

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 14:51:04 GMT):<br/>
Also, to the TSC:  whatever people decide to do with this, can we finally write up some guidelines for projects applying for incubation (I realize I may be volunteering myself for part of this).  It's not productive for anyone (and very frustrating for people proposing projects) to have these drawn-out discussions about project incubation votes.  Ideally it should be as clear as possible when a project is ready for incubation, and everyone from the TSC to the proposers should have a good idea whether a project will be accepted or not.
</p>
<p><strong>peter_somogyvari</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 14:51:46 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 14:51:56 GMT):<br/>
@hartm -- i agree that this would be helpful.  there are other active labs interested in the process but are feeling blocked because it isn't clear what is needed.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 14:55:03 GMT):<br/>
I realize that different TSC members have different criteria, but even some general guidelines such that "if you have X, Y, and Z, you are likely to be accepted, and if you're missing \alpha, \beta, or \gamma, you are likely to have problems" would be immensely useful.
</p>
<p><strong>mtng</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 14:56:33 GMT):<br/>
In this line, perhaps it would be interesting to promote conversations between different labs. Perhaps, several labs could end up converging in the same Hyperledger project. Because, for example TrustID Lab could be converged in or complement the Firefly identity management

<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 15:05:22 GMT):<br/>
Agreed.  Perhaps if a project proposal is discussed in one meeting and a vote to approve/disapprove doesn't occur by the end of the next meeting it is automatically tabled for... 1 month? But then there are issues relating to what if no discussion happens in the next month.  Roberts rules of order and all.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 15:06:26 GMT):<br/>
The TSC doesn't use Robert's rules of order - perhaps that would be a good amendment to the TSC charter?
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 15:06:34 GMT):<br/>
It is important for an open source effort that those making tangible contributions aren’t blocked by those who are not.  It seems we have tangible efforts to work on here, but we need to be sure the  Firefly proposal isn’t blocked by abstract concerns or non-open-source product competition fears, and that the effort to collaborate and improve the project doesn’t go dark but proceeds with constructive dialog in a way that the maintainers are agreeable to.   
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 15:07:09 GMT):<br/>
Yep, this was my ask for a guarantee that people will look at integration.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 15:07:36 GMT):<br/>

"Look at" not "do."
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 15:10:01 GMT):<br/>
This is why I think Firefly should go into labs today.  Based on the mailing list it looks like Blockchain Automation Framework has been running regular calls for their contributors.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 15:20:57 GMT):<br/>
re: convergence.  I think it's worth publicly looking into, but my project vote will not hinge on whether or not convergence happens. My reason to table is I don't see sufficient evidence that the current firefly stewards can operate as a fully open source project. Do I think they can?  Yes, but I can't point to evidence. 2 or more months as a labs projects give them opportunities to 
(a) interact with community contributions  
(b) run contributor calls 
(c) discuss design issues in either the labs rocket chat room or the labs mailing list.
(d) get the code moved into Hyperledger repos
The convergence discussion will provide harsher than needed evidence for (c).  And meeting all the published requirements for (d) always takes longer than you think.  Governance issues like how to promote maintainers would be nice, but not required.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 15:22:40 GMT):<br/>
My concern with an auto-table rule is if the agenda prevents discussion and vote it becomes a stealth filibuster.  Perhaps we do it as a TSC practice and not a mechanical rule.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 15:24:02 GMT):<br/>
I don't think we need an auto-tabling rule.  But we should make an effort to streamline long discussions.
</p>
<p><strong>Bobbijn</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 15:27:00 GMT):<br/>
I agree with Danno. The Lab environment was set up to foster these conversations, what convergence looks like can take place there. Firefly becoming a lab project will help Firefly folks become acquainted with the Hyperledger open source environment and us to become familiar with Firefly.
</p>
<p><strong>davidwboswell</strong> (Thu, 03 Jun 2021 15:32:48 GMT):<br/>
good point.  promoting more discussions among leads of labs could have a lot of positive results.

I'd like to make a suggestion. Would it be possible have github changes (PR opened, PR merged, issue created etc) to become notifications in rocketchat channels? It's great to have activity on github more publicised.

Forgive me if this isn't the right channel for this (I'm not sure where this should go).
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Tue, 06 Jul 2021 13:35:11 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the suggestion @seanyoung #community-architects would be more appropriate for this question. We have a similar tracker in https://start-here.hyperledger.org. Pull Requests for Solang https://start-here.hyperledger.org/pull-requests/hyperledger-labs/solang. This tool also tracks good first issues from GitHub and releases from last 7 days.
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 06 Jul 2021 14:31:07 GMT):<br/>
@arsulegai that's interesting, thanks for pointing that out. It's not quite what I had in mind, let's discuss this further in #community-architects
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 06 Jul 2021 14:51:04 GMT):<br/>
@seanyoung I would love to do that - rocket.chat is going away next quarter, so I would caution against building on it
</p>
<p><strong>seanyoung</strong> (Tue, 06 Jul 2021 14:52:05 GMT):<br/>
@rjones ah interesting. Yes no point in building on rocketchat then. What's the replacement?

Find everything in one place (a community forum) that lists all possible means of asking questions/reaching out to others within the community -> redirect people to respective chat platform (to directly talk to somebody)

As discussed in last week's TSC meeting, we are kicking off the Hyperledger Community Chat Task Force. The goal of this Task Force is to provide a recommendation around the chat channel(s) Hyperledger will use moving forward. The first meeting for the group will be tomorrow from 1 to 2 PM ET. Anyone is welcome to join the Task Force. https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/tsc/viewevent?eventid=1335444&calstart=2021-11-17

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 15:35:28 GMT):<br/>
I think one of the underlying issues here is that a lot of the projects and the project contributors don't feel a tight connection to the TSC (or that they benefit much by keeping the TSC informed).  Lots of people on this call (e.g. Tracy, Bobbi) have given good evidence that projects do benefit from keeping the TSC informed, but I'm not sure some of the projects and contributors see this or are aware of this.  I think that if we can delineate more benefits of keeping the TSC informed, then we will have less issues with late or nondescriptive quarterly reports.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 15:37:23 GMT):<br/>
Another point:  inactive projects that aren't doing their quarterly reports should clearly be considered for dormancy.  But what about relatively active projects that aren't submitting their quarterly reports on time?  It seems like we still have some of those.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 15:44:37 GMT):<br/>

I found the [original proposal on project reports](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yUGD1bKPk1APsgZwMKrBDzpl98x8nr0k3IPJhJnawOU/edit). The goal of the project reports was listed as follows:
> To access the health and status of the projects under the Hyperledger umbrella.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 16:29:01 GMT):<br/>
And the [mailing list thread on the proposal](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/tsc/topic/17552056#854). I am sure there is a recording of the discussions in the TSC from that time
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 06 Jan 2022 16:33:08 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt I thought of another way that history changes - a long-lived PR, when merged, will change history
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 10 Jan 2022 21:51:09 GMT):<br/>
Hello, TSC members. Does anyone have suggestions for projects, WGs, SIGs, or a lab that would like to present at this week's TSC call? At the moment, I only have one item on the agenda : The Importance of TSC Quarterly Project Updates.
</p>
<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Tue, 11 Jan 2022 07:02:40 GMT):<br/>
I think we should invite Climate action SIG, they are doing good stuff
</p>
<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Tue, 11 Jan 2022 07:03:06 GMT):<br/>
Can I ask them?
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 11 Jan 2022 14:57:45 GMT):<br/>
Yes, please
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 11 Jan 2022 14:58:10 GMT):<br/>
Even if they cannot make this week, let's get them on the calendar for a future call
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 11 Jan 2022 14:59:53 GMT):<br/>
Although, I may have another presentation scheduled for this week, but it has not yet been confirmed
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Tue, 11 Jan 2022 15:20:29 GMT):<br/>
Looks like the other presentation wants to push back by a month. Let me know if I should add the Climate Action SIG this week or at a later time.
</p>
<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Tue, 11 Jan 2022 16:10:20 GMT):<br/>
Sure @tkuhrt 
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Wed, 12 Jan 2022 11:27:22 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt we now have concrete information and plans to run Hyperledger Challenge. Request to accommodate @Nancy @Andrea @Erik
</p>
<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Wed, 12 Jan 2022 13:43:41 GMT):<br/>
talked to Climate SIG team, they are not available this week TSC meeting. I will ask them for next week.
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Wed, 12 Jan 2022 14:32:11 GMT):<br/>
I will add Hyperledger Challenge to the agenda
</p>
<p><strong>knagware9</strong> (Wed, 12 Jan 2022 15:28:18 GMT):<br/>
Next week TSC 20th Jan Clima SIG chair & co-chair will join..can be added to TSC agenda
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Wed, 12 Jan 2022 17:20:21 GMT):<br/>
Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 15:44:18 GMT):<br/>
@hartm what if the project starts to think that they do not have an issue, so no reports are needed?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 15:45:29 GMT):<br/>
@arsulegai I think that's already what some projects think.  Some of the reports are quite minimal.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 15:51:11 GMT):<br/>
Having to send reports is also an indicator to the project to strive towards graduation. Projects get constantly reminded on what's next.

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 19:00:33 GMT):<br/>
This is opening up a whole different can of worms, and one that David's diagram addresses.  I don't think there are enough incentives at this point to strive for graduation, and this is something we can't solve only with reports.  Maybe we could try to have some kind of timeframe and help projects project where they should be?  If you have any suggestions on this, it would be wonderful.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 13 Jan 2022 20:29:15 GMT):<br/>
time limit on how long you can be in incubation status, before you are transferred to labs?
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Fri, 14 Jan 2022 05:08:11 GMT):<br/>
That’s brutal on projects? Let’s try incentive before punishment 😄
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 14 Jan 2022 05:13:30 GMT):<br/>
I'd worry that a time limit would be much too brutal.  Seeking approval for the TSC for graduation would be a huge swing:  get in, and your project is approved.  Don't, and you go back down to labs, which may kill your project.  Imagine if you're using things (i.e. CI/CD) provided by Hyperledger extensively for projects in incubation and then lose those because you go back down to labs?  People would probably just quit Hyperledger. My guess is that, in practice, this would just lead to project consolidation (projects that are on the bubble would join a related project--and mostly act independently still--rather than go through the graduation hurdle).

#challenge is there now
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:33:19 GMT):<br/>
As I understand it, a lot of the work that was being done in Avalon is now being done in https://confidentialcomputing.io/,'
</p>

@lehors Unarchived :)
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:35:09 GMT):<br/>
well, that may not have been necessary because I expect that's the way it's going to be
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:37:02 GMT):<br/>
well, your point about updating the landing page is correct, so that needs to be done
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:37:24 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:39:14 GMT):<br/>
+1 to Tracy
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:39:35 GMT):<br/>
I don't think we should go out of our way to keep such projects alive
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:39:52 GMT):<br/>
if there are people interested they are welcome to step forward
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:40:07 GMT):<br/>
and we can then revisit the project status
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:42:26 GMT):<br/>
Shall we mark the project as Dormant for 6 months instead of Deprecation?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:43:13 GMT):<br/>
I think that is misleading - there is no plan to revisit Avalon in the future
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:43:48 GMT):<br/>
Ok
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:46:15 GMT):<br/>
in case anyone is wondering, this is CCC: https://confidentialcomputing.io/
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:46:38 GMT):<br/>
I think the CCC is the best place to link, and the best story:  the contributors to Avalon actually went there, and it's nice to know that they didn't just lose interest in the project--they just moved it to a more appropriate venue in the Linux Foundation.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:47:22 GMT):<br/>
I suspect that this isn't the last time that this will happen within Hyperledger and the LF:  we will probably have considerable overlap with some of the things that the OpenSSF is looking to build around identity, for instance.
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:47:57 GMT):<br/>
I suggest Hart volunteers for the PR :)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:52:59 GMT):<br/>
I would appreciate it :)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:53:21 GMT):<br/>
I was thinking about making a new, empty branch that only has the README and making it the default
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 16:03:07 GMT):<br/>
I am swamped.  Can I do it this weekend?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 20 Jan 2022 16:05:52 GMT):<br/>
Sure

@arsulegai I'm assuming this is about the performance sand box lab?
</p>
<p><strong>grace.hartley</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 15:21:38 GMT):<br/>
+1 to translations of documentation for graduated projects - Besu would like that
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 15:24:21 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 15:24:53 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for spotting this and encouraging collaboration!
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 15:25:24 GMT):<br/>
I have a suggestion, it may not directly come under TSC scope. Would sponsoring additional developers to graduated projects be an option?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 15:25:58 GMT):<br/>
Probably not?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 15:26:11 GMT):<br/>
It's not something that has ever been done before.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 15:27:51 GMT):<br/>
How about helping out on routine tasks?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 15:27:53 GMT):<br/>
If there is some kind of expertise needed (i.e. a project needs a little bit of time from a security expert), then maybe this would be something we could help with graduated projects?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 15:28:27 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure that HL will be able to fund general development though.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 15:28:28 GMT):<br/>
Ex: Project management, release management etc
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 15:29:35 GMT):<br/>
I think we can pretty reasonably require that projects graduate from incubation before we fund translation efforts.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 15:38:28 GMT):<br/>
I always forget to announce at the beginning of the call :) ~ wanted to remind the TSC for tomorrow's Security Process Update Task Force meeting. Maybe I will raise hand at the end of this call.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 15:45:31 GMT):<br/>
You're doing great @rjones !
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 27 Jan 2022 15:46:02 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 14:29:49 GMT):<br/>
He just confirmed his participation a while ago.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 14:34:46 GMT):<br/>
Context: Raul (is from another project within The LF) had reached out to Alfonso for collaboration with Hyperledger community.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 15:11:41 GMT):<br/>
@shemnon I think projects typically tend to overstate their healthiness in the quarterly reports.  This is a good reason why we should put concrete metrics on the quarterly reports rather than ask the maintainers.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 15:12:02 GMT):<br/>
Yes, I'm sure they overstate.  Some of those may be aspirational overstatements too.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 15:12:13 GMT):<br/>
I'm actually quite happy that the Explorer team was straightforward with their report.  It will help them more than just saying everything is fine.
</p>
<p><strong>shemnon</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 15:12:45 GMT):<br/>
And explorer's response is why I feel we should take report status at face value.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 15:39:59 GMT):<br/>
@lehors Agreed.  I think that we should let projects that decide to go dormant determine how long they want to stay dormant (contingent upon their support for critical fixes, etc.).  The projects where the TSC has to intervene because literally no one is working on the project probably should go directly to end of life.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 15:40:44 GMT):<br/>
Shall we grant the status in 3 months chunks?
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 15:41:19 GMT):<br/>
i.e. A project can be dormant for 3 months, they will have to apply for it again at the end of 3 months
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 15:44:33 GMT):<br/>
These reports are great!
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 15:45:58 GMT):<br/>
@arsulegai As long as the maintainers are still fixing things, I don't know that it's necessary to have them keep reapplying for dormant status.  In practice, I would imagine that maintainers still working on a project would quit when all of the major dependencies have updated to not use the project, and this may not be easily determined.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 15:52:28 GMT):<br/>
How about asking those passive maintainers to have a minimal summary report (in the regular report cycle)? It can be a yes or no to a bunch of questions or one word replies. This will keep us informed of what's coming. It will keep the maintainers engaged.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 15:52:28 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 15:53:47 GMT):<br/>
@lehors I think one of the best outcomes here is that we could "Tom Sayer" insights into doing this work for us...
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 15:53:47 GMT):<br/>
@lehors I think one of the best outcomes here is that we could "Tom Sawyer" insights into doing this work for us...
</p>
<p><strong>lehors</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 15:55:23 GMT):<br/>
that would be good
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 15:55:42 GMT):<br/>
@arsulegai I'm hesitant to ask maintainers who are trying to quit and not do work to actually do more work.  Maybe a very minimal form like you suggest would do the trick.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 15:56:25 GMT):<br/>
I like the idea of an EOL coach better than asking maintainers who are feeling burned out to do more 
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 16:00:17 GMT):<br/>
Nicer idea @nage . Connect with coach once every 3 months. No reports, the coach can help prepare a report.
</p>
<p><strong>arsulegai</strong> (Thu, 03 Feb 2022 16:00:17 GMT):<br/>
Nicer idea @nage . Connect with coach once every 3 months. No reports needed from the maintainers, the coach can help prepare a report. To be honest, we can be firm asking maintainers to do this as a least while during Dormant. If they feel that their intentions are tending towards no more support, it gives us sooner indications. TSC can then propose a EOL for them.

To address one of Arnaud's point regarding ensuring the migration is successful, we do have milestones and check ins for a successful migration path. We are also recommending the TSC play a role in checking in on the process for the projects over the transition period with the quarterly reports process.
