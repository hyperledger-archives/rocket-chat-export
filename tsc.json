{"msg":"Hi channel, I'm seeking a little orientation on what work/thought may have already been undertaken on cross-chain communication in the sense of:\n\nA: Atomic exchange of transactions between (separate instances/deployments of) chains of the same type (i.e. Hyperledger projects)\nB: Transaction (um) 'fungibility' between chains of different types (e.g. mapping a fabric transaction/payload to a sawtooth one and having it run there with the same underlying logic)\nC: Atomic exchange of transactions between chains of different types\n\nRegarding A and C, I know that Fabric has a channels mechanism - I think Sawtooth probably does (?), not sure about Iroha. I don't know how applicable same chain type channels/subnet/zones notions might be to facilitating cross-chain communication with some form of consensus guarantees. In a most basic form a single client could claim a transaction on chain X, then send the equivalent transaction to chain Y (using some B-like ability). Some kind of distributed lock could be used to ensure consistency but it would still be a single point of failure.\n\nMy particular interest is in building various types of compatibility between chains with the Ethereum virtual machine as the broker of that compatibility.

{"msg":"I really enjoyed catching up on this discussion regarding formalizing the path to 1.0 (and/or out of incubation). It has been on @silasdavis and my minds lately. For those that do not know me, I mostly lurk in this room, but I work with Silas at Monax. \n\nI'd like to highlight how difficult the diversity metric is for small teams to achieve. Even those that have good (we hope) engineering practices and are doing things \"correctly\" in terms of trying to build a community of contributors. The reality is that it is a heavy burden to shepherd the pipeline of users one would eventually hope to convert into contributors.\n\nThere is a very small world of engineers that can effectively contribute to these codebases. As an example, we have a new engineer we're about to onboard who has dozens of substantive contributions to the kernel, years of distributed database experience, and I expect it will be 2-3 months before he's able to contribute substantively. And that will be working on burrow full-time and sitting next to Silas every day.\n\nWhile I'm 100% for sustainability of the Hyperledger codebases, and while I also understand that this is a tricky issue, I do think that there should be a practical avenue for a smaller team to get to a 1.0 without having to meet a relatively arbitrary diversity metric that I'm not entirely sure is meaningful pre-1.0. In that (pre-1.0) phase, the signal is that a codebase is in incubation / not ready for production / may go away / etc. As Kelly noted, contributors to Hyperledger codebases are almost always doing so for a business reason. This means that there needs to be a business reason to contribute, and it is quite hard for small teams to get other teams to see that business reason without the \"mark\" of 1.0. \n\nGenuinely not trying to moan; sorry for the long post; and thanks for letting me lurk.

Another comment they make is that since they ship the components on both sides of the divide, they are better protected against misalignment of the .proto file.

But, 100% want documented good ideas or descriptions on how stuff works and why to do it a certain way, and the trade-offs of different approaches. In Sawtooth for example, that could flow into its RFC process. Continuing with the consensus example - it's completely non-trivial to support both non-forking and forking consensus at the same time. It's a super advanced topic. Putting together a paper on how to create a good API/pattern to support both and also all other consensus requirements we can think of seems very worthwhile. (By API  here, I don't literally mean an API spec per-se, but enough description to understand how one would implement the patterns.) And it goes beyond API specs, because (continuing with this example) there are impacts on the rest of the system in features like forking consensus that need to be considered/mitigated.

It wouldn't be too much work for projects Alpha, Beta, and Gamma to switch.\"  Even if the projects ultimately ignored or disregarded this advice, I think it would still be useful (at least moreso than the current working group outputs).","username":"hartm","ts":"2019-06-13T17:25:28.488Z"}

{"msg":"This is the way I've always thought about it and described it to others: Hyperledger is more than some mere aggregation of similar projects.  Pick your metaphor - greenhouse, portfolio, wolfpack -  a project comes to Hyperledger, and is accepted, to be integrated into a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.  We don't impose architecture or roadmaps top-down - project teams still have the freedom to decide what to work on and when to ship.  But there are some common standards we require: Apache 2.0 license, use of Github or Gerrit, public discussions, etc, so as to help people new to Hyperledger come up to speed on a project and how we work, as well as to more easily jump from one project to another.  There are many other, opportunistic, bottoms-up opportunities for convergence and collaboration between projects, but sometimes it's hard to lift your head from your own Jira dashboard and check out what others working on that may be similar, what lessons they've learned that might apply to your work, what standards may be relevant to consider, and how to reduce further any zero-value differences between projects that end up being barriers.   For those needs, we use Working Groups focused around these common needs, to bring developers and other contributors from across the different projects together to look at these thematic areas of common interest, and for that to be a good use of everyone's time.  Working Group participants should not view their time there as a charity, but as an obligation; but that obligation should be compensated for in the form of reduced duplication of effort, better designs before coding has begun, better documentation approaches, and so on.

For example, we have around a dozen maintainers here at Bitwise IO across projects. We don't have the travel budget of HL or Intel, and probably can't justify sending a dozen people across the country, but those are the very people who would make those conversations a success.

{"msg":"@Dan - I am attempting to better formulate my concern (and why I am not so convinced on the simplicity). I think there great benefits to working on code in the Hyperledger community. (among them: collaboration, interop, common code contribution process, visibility). I also think we can experience issues if there isn't enough oxygen to allow for \"related/sub/minor\" projects to operate under the Hyperledger processes. I have not thought that the \"labs\" concept is a sufficient solution - this word has the connotation of a PoC. I also am wary if we have \"code owners\" working diligently at their components if they end up with a \"2nd tier\" role/voice in the overall project.","username":"troyronda","ts":"2019-09-26T16:16:41.205Z"}

{"msg":"But we're not in Apache: we're in Linux Foundation.  LF CII already defines diversity criteria for a Gold badge as follows:\n\n\"\"\"\nContinuity\n\nThe project MUST have at least two unassociated significant contributors.

Financial grants do not count as being from the same organization if they pass through other organizations (e.g., science grants paid to different organizations from a common government or NGO source do not cause contributors to be associated). Someone is a significant contributor if they have made non-trivial contributions to the project in the past year. Examples of good indicators of a significant contributor are: written at least 1,000 lines of code, contributed 50 commits, or contributed at least 20 pages of documentation.\n\nRationale: This reduces the risk of non-support if a single organization stops supporting the project as FLOSS. It also reduces the risk of malicious code insertion, since there is more independence between contributors. This covers the case where \"two people work for company X, but only one is paid to work on this project\" (because the non-paid person could still have many of the same incentives). It also covers the case where \"two people got paid working for Red Cross for a day, but Red Cross doesn't use the project\".\n\"\"\"\n\nWe might quibble over whether 2 is enough, and whether continuity is the only reason for requiring diversity, but sure it makes sense to inherit this rather than invent something new nad slightly different from a completely different organisation?","username":"JonGeater","ts":"2020-01-27T13:29:49.146Z"}

We've been using an external, hosted service both for simplicity and objectivity - as a system we don't run, we can't be accused of putting our thumb on the scales. But that now clearly comes at the cost of ability to deliver a trusted election to not just 98% of eligible voters but 100% of them, because we can't see where the failures are. So next year I suspect we'll decide to use a system we drive directly, favoring something that works over something separated.","username":"bbehlendorf","ts":"2020-10-08T15:04:21.375Z"}
{"msg":"Here's another place where not having direct control over CIVS causes us grief. By design, CIVS does not retain the email addresses of the ballots it sends out, but it does retain a hash. If we give it an email address, it can tell us if it's already been provisioned a ballot in a given poll, or if it represents a new address. We can always add a second email address for someone to the voting rolls, but we can't invalidate their earlier address and corresponding ballot.  So, if that person is not honest, it allows them to vote twice. So, while we are happy to use a different address if we can't get the first one to work after a couple of attempts, there are trust issues with using secondary email addresses frequently.","username":"bbehlendorf","ts":"2020-10-08T15:14:55.921Z"}

If we can get enough productive topics we could consider doing it as often as every other week, but certainly this shouldn’t be _the_ way to get good technical discussions on the agenda, just an effort by the TSC to solicit those topics from the community and make the community more comfortable bringing up interesting discussions on their own.","username":"nage","ts":"2020-10-22T14:42:02.221Z"}

{"msg":"I'd worry that a time limit would be much too brutal.  Seeking approval for the TSC for graduation would be a huge swing:  get in, and your project is approved.  Don't, and you go back down to labs, which may kill your project.  Imagine if you're using things (i.e. CI/CD) provided by Hyperledger extensively for projects in incubation and then lose those because you go back down to labs?  People would probably just quit Hyperledger. My guess is that, in practice, this would just lead to project consolidation (projects that are on the bubble would join a related project--and mostly act independently still--rather than go through the graduation hurdle).","username":"hartm","ts":"2022-01-14T05:13:30.403Z"}
