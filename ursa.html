TLDR from today's meeting:
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 19:04:58 GMT):<br/>
1)  We should split off the tier 3 portion of the library.  It's probably a better fit for labs, and might hinder the current proposal.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 19:05:51 GMT):<br/>
2) Indy and Sawtooth are going to create a repository to begin looking at combining some signature functionality.  If there are some successes, this will be the initial codebase of the project proposal.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 19:06:18 GMT):<br/>
3) We need further discussion with Fabric crypto people to discuss their role in this effort.
</p>
<p><strong>MicBowman</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 21:29:39 GMT):<br/>
@hartm does this mean you don't need our wrapper? perfectly fine with me... but we should update the proposal accordingly

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 22 Feb 2018 23:25:07 GMT):<br/>
I'm going to update the proposal.  The Indy/Sawtooth repository will utilize this wrapper functionality, so we will definitely need the Sawtooth wrapper.

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 23 Feb 2018 20:29:20 GMT):<br/>
@MicBowman can you push up your wrapper somewhere so we can see it? The pieces we were discussing for signing aren't necessarily the code Sawtooth is using for PoET currently; rather, the libsecp256k1 wrappers for the various languages.

<p><strong>nage</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 07:01:17 GMT):<br/>
There is a lot of interesting work at Rebooting the Web of Trust about extending TLS libraries to be able to leverage non-CA certificates anchored to blockchains.  It seems like an interesting case to support mutually authenticated connections and ledger membership use cases for our systems.  Im looking for opinions, would that be good work to take up in the shared crypto library, as a HL lab or something else?

<p><strong>tobowers</strong> (Wed, 07 Mar 2018 21:08:27 GMT):<br/>
this the right place to talk about libindy-crypto?
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Thu, 08 Mar 2018 20:32:46 GMT):<br/>
@tobowers Depends on the question. But indy-sdk is another appropriate channel since most devs of the library hang out there
</p>
<p><strong>tobowers</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 07:31:19 GMT):<br/>
Thanks @lovesh - I sent my question to the hyperledger-indy mailing list. I figured out what I was doing wrong... but I'm still concerned that I passed in a bunch of bad bytes to the FFI verify function (single BLS signature) and the result was a success error code and a True for verified
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 16:04:10 GMT):<br/>
  @tobowers That seems like a bug.  If you can recreate it (it sounds like you have found a way to essentially forge a signature) it would definitely be something the indy devs should know about.
</p>
<p><strong>gudkov</strong> (Fri, 09 Mar 2018 20:48:41 GMT):<br/>
@hartm I can't see your email in mailing list. Could you provide more info here or just create a bug in Jira or Github. 
</p>
<p><strong>tobowers</strong> (Sat, 10 Mar 2018 08:23:23 GMT):<br/>
@hartm , @gudkov https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/IS-583

<p><strong>gudkov</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 16:43:29 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/crypto-lib?msg=GdsptKEAyWetxZ3ag) This result can be easily achieved if you used incorrect data for generator point and verkey/signkey pair. The math is valid only if you use correct (gp, verkey, signkey) tuple. At least i see that Generator Point contains garbage (zero points). If any of (gp, verkey, signkey) values contain garbade the result is unpredictable. If multiplies something by zero it will be always zero.
</p>

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 19:12:06 GMT):<br/>
@gudkov @tobowers Yeah, I just looked at your trace.  You're using zero for the generator element, which will give you all kinds of bad results.  Since it seems like you've already fixed this, I wouldn't worry too much about it.  However, note that an adversary can control the bytes for the (message, signature) pair, it cannot control the public or secret keys (or the group generator) and we can generally assume those will be correct (assuming no hardware attacks).
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 19:14:13 GMT):<br/>
This isn't a bug in indy-crypt, but if it's easy to stop people from using clearly flawed choices (i.e. zero or the point at infinity) as parameters in a side-channel resilient manner (or warn them when they do), it might be worth the time to do it in the long run.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 12 Mar 2018 22:47:07 GMT):<br/>
@here Are people still OK with a call tomorrow at 7:00 AM Pacific time (10:00 Eastern)?  There seem to be less scheduling conflicts this week.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 13 Mar 2018 07:37:20 GMT):<br/>
@here OK, on second thought, we're not ready for a meeting tomorrow.  I'll try to put together a formal agenda, invite, and everything so that we can maximize participation.  Sorry for the delays.

The planned meeting topics will include 1) going over the new lab infrastructure (we have a lab repo now), 2) discussing how we want to start working, and 3) discussing any sort of governance/proposal suggestions that people may have.  Any other topics that people bring up during the course of the meeting will be fine as well.

I send my regrets.  Myself and a bunch of others are at the Internet Identity Workshop.  I’m really interested in how the build and packaging will shake out so we can transition Indy-crypto code over while we are still using it in our production system.

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 15:48:04 GMT):<br/>
@amundson No worries!  We didn't decide anything particularly important.  We heard a lot from the Fabric folks in attendance (Bin and Jan) about how they wanted to be involved with crypto-lib.  You can see a (very meager) outline of what went on in the discussion notes, which are in the second link above.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 15:49:38 GMT):<br/>
should I move forward with adding python and/or go signing SDK from Sawtooth to the crypto-lib labs repo?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 16:00:42 GMT):<br/>
@amundson  You're welcome to do so if you like.  It might be a good thing for comparison with Fabric and Indy.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 04 Apr 2018 16:04:39 GMT):<br/>
ideally, we mash them all up and come up with the one-true-way
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 14:04:35 GMT):<br/>
are we meeting now?
</p>
<p><strong>manu</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 14:06:03 GMT):<br/>
@Dan I think the idea is to have it every second week and since there was one last week there would be no meeting today
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 11 Apr 2018 14:07:50 GMT):<br/>
thx @manu 
@hartm I have a recurring invite for every week on my calendar. Could you update that?

</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 14:48:37 GMT):<br/>
Open question from meeting: Should threshold signatures etc fit into a unified signing interface or should there be multiple APIs?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 14:59:06 GMT):<br/>
Ideally we’d design an API that is abstracted enough that we avoid having multiple. 
</p>
<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 15:21:06 GMT):<br/>
My action items from the meeting today:
1. Study the code that the Sawtooth team committed to github.com/hyperledger-labs/crypto-lib; produce a mapping to indy constructs and post the mapping here and on indy and sawtooth mailing lists
2. Per Hart's request, produce a clean summary of indy APIs that omits all the messy details, so pure API comparison is easy
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 02 May 2018 15:27:26 GMT):<br/>
@danielhardman there are examples of the Sawtooth signing code in other languages as well if that is helpful

</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Mon, 07 May 2018 17:16:56 GMT):<br/>
Just jumping on in here, I have an implementation of threshold sig that fits behind both PKCS#11 and the eIDAS remote signing APIs just fine.  I don’t think it should matter how your key material is protected or processed for what signing API you call
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 13:05:55 GMT):<br/>
@JonGeater that sounds cool. The question I think you were responding to was whether there should be one signing / verification API that would cover all sig types including ECDSA & Threshold. Or whether it would be better to have those APIs separate. 
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 13:42:55 GMT):<br/>
@Dan yes exactly.  I agree with @dhuseby    that we should be able to abstract sufficiently to make it a single API.  
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 13:44:13 GMT):<br/>
The management piece (mainly just key generation in this case) is very different and will get complex, but you had that problem anyway
</p>
<p><strong>manu</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 13:46:39 GMT):<br/>
@JonGeater Sounds interesting, could you share a link to the implementation? Which scheme do you implement?
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 13:48:39 GMT):<br/>
(An assumption I’m making here, which is very important, is that the design of the API will delegate policy enforcement to inside the crypto module  and so you won’t have to express semantic details of things like shares and access control inline with the crypto calls themselves.  I hope this is the line we’re going down.  So either an authorised session model or an opaque authtoken model)
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 13:49:55 GMT):<br/>
Hi @manu, yes a few people have asked, I’m looking how we can expose it - it’s currently in our internal gitlab but should be easy enough to port to an exposed server given a little time.  We’re going to put the paper out as a blog post very soon.
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Tue, 08 May 2018 13:51:26 GMT):<br/>
The scheme is a fairly vanilla Damgard.  We explicitly were not trying to improve the art in MPC signing itself, but rather prove out the other two ends: higher assurance key sharing at the management end, and simple abstract API integration at the client

Is crypto-lib call on this week? @hartm 
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 25 Jun 2018 19:14:15 GMT):<br/>
@VipinB Not sure--we will need to see the final hackfest schedule and phone availability.  If possible, I'll set up a call.
</p>
<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Mon, 25 Jun 2018 20:15:47 GMT):<br/>
It may not be at the same time? anyway...

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 27 Jun 2018 07:58:05 GMT):<br/>
Looks like it will be in the 6:00-8:00 range (AM, Pacific time) on Thursday, among other times, although the schedule is never firm on hackfests.  Not sure whether we'll be able to set up a call though.

hi everyone from hyperledger hackfest in Amsterdam. I've been attending some talks and interactions, while I'm working on the integration of my VM (zenroom.dyne.org) into some projects. I've been told I should join this group too, since I have experience of using amcl (milagro) in C and succesfully build it to wasm too (that's one of the zenroom targets). I'm a sporadic and mostly docs related contributor to the C milagro implementation.
</p>
<p><strong>jaromil</strong> (Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:03:36 GMT):<br/>
I think it was @nage suggesting that. You got me sooo interested that I've even accepted to leave IRC for a web interface :^) I'd be happy to help with milagro if needed and to reply any question about zenroom. I'm hacking away on my laptop in the big room and will attend next sessions if you like to meet in person. @nage if you are still around today would like to have a brief talk before leaving!

@manu Do you have any specific tests for z-mix that you have so far? It would be nice to build on your starting point if any
</p>
<p><strong>manu</strong> (Mon, 09 Jul 2018 17:24:16 GMT):<br/>
Not yet, but i think the big picture should be fairly straightforward: we test parsing of valid JSON ZKL statements, test whether we can successfully create a proof with a valid corresponding witness, and check that the proof verifies. And the proof components should allow for individual unit tests
</p>

I am assuming we will use Apache milagro crypto for our implementation. For that we need to build a rust crate from the amcl source which requires us to choose curves we want to work with. Which curves do we wanna support? I am assuming we can start with BLS12-381 (supports pairing).

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 27 Jul 2018 21:03:48 GMT):<br/>
keep in mind that when it compiles, the library name will be prefixed with *lib* so libcrypto-lib would look weird to me

<p><strong>manu</strong> (Mon, 30 Jul 2018 13:41:13 GMT):<br/>
HCl would be funny given that NaCl is a well-known crypto library. But i agree that the -lib is no good, so hyperledger-crypto or hl-crypto make sense to me. Given that e.g. hyperledger fabric's repo is called 'fabric', that would mean our repo should be called 'crypto'. 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 30 Jul 2018 19:49:34 GMT):<br/>
I'm think hl-crypto
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 00:55:36 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder any thoughts on approach we should take to merging sawtooth and indy signing libraries?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 01:15:13 GMT):<br/>
I was thinking that’s what the common signing interface was for. See https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BvAXUGR6Gur12yEPbqCegiAuOChiZqEMp6CO3z8RxMk @amundson [ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/crypto-lib?msg=SquDHu6ZP4dfnuwNn)
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 01:15:34 GMT):<br/>
I’m going to be adding privacy preserving signatures to that as well
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 01:15:54 GMT):<br/>
Let me know if what’s there doesn’t work. Feel free to add comments
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 01:16:36 GMT):<br/>
I have submitted a PR to merge sawtooth and Indy into one repo. Then I’m going to take a try and merging the interface 
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 01:22:18 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder the doc doesn't say much :)
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 01:22:28 GMT):<br/>
Indy uses Ed25519 signatures and BLS-254
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 01:24:46 GMT):<br/>
what I'm wondering is what we find lacking in the Sawtooth signing API, so we can discuss specifics on how we would integrate those things. or if we don't have consensus with Sawtooth's signing API as a starting point, I think then it would be great to know why so we can attempt to address that in the new design.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 01:25:31 GMT):<br/>
yeah open issue https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github/issues/157
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 01:32:19 GMT):<br/>
If we end up with something backward-compatible or at least reasonably close to the current sawtooth signing api, that will greatly help us port to crypto-lib (and may give us a boost in creating the other language implementations, if we can take code from Sawtooth to get them started)
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 13:07:04 GMT):<br/>
I think the Sawtooth signing interface is very close to what we had in mind in terms of an API.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 14:09:26 GMT):<br/>
It wasn't that the Sawtooth API is "lacking", just that we need more general rules for signature APIs if we want to extend an API to more signature protocols.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 14:15:49 GMT):<br/>
Probably the biggest change we need to make is right now with the sawtooth signing api is the notion for type objects. Currently its using a factory method to create a context. We are proposing that we use type objects that encapsulate the algorithms. Taking what's currently there, we can create the ECDSA_Secp256K1_SHA256 type object. It could still be created using the factory method.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 14:17:08 GMT):<br/>
Maybe we could shorten the names to just SECP256K1_SHA256 but I like having the ECDSA prefix for crypto noobs

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 14:17:27 GMT):<br/>
maybe that's not a problem with Hyperledger projects. Thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 14:44:29 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder we could do a before/after of the secp256k1 test code (which is essentially examples for our purpose), so that it's not abstract; the rust code is https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/blob/master/sdk/rust/src/signing/secp256k1.rs and the python code is https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core/blob/master/signing/tests/test_secp256k1_signer.py
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 14:47:41 GMT):<br/>
so, for example, we can take single_key_signing() which today looks like:
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 14:47:45 GMT):<br/>
```let context = create_context("secp256k1").unwrap();
let factory = CryptoFactory::new(&*context);
let priv_key = Secp256k1PrivateKey::from_hex(KEY1_PRIV_HEX).unwrap();
let signer = factory.new_signer(&priv_key);
let signature = signer.sign(&String::from(MSG1).into_bytes()).unwrap();
```
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 14:47:56 GMT):<br/>
and mock up what it would look like after
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 15:36:10 GMT):<br/>
sure
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 31 Jul 2018 16:32:42 GMT):<br/>
FWIW, one of the enhancements we are talking about is a function we can combine the first four lines for things like CLI commands - "let signer = create_secp256k1_signer_from_hex(KEY1_PRIV_HEX)" or something like that since those four lines, while useful for more complex apps, are boiler plate for the simple case.

@dhuseby I think LGPL is a compatible license but can you double check that's copacetic? (Per discussion that libsnarks has a downstream link dependency on https://gmplib.org/)
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 08 Aug 2018 16:08:21 GMT):<br/>
So I wasn't clear what the next steps that are required to move crypto-lib from labs to incubator. Can someone put those details here?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 08 Aug 2018 17:06:22 GMT):<br/>
has anyone looked at Ring, and if so, any thoughts? https://briansmith.org/rustdoc/ring/signature/index.html
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 08 Aug 2018 17:37:21 GMT):<br/>
I've looked at it and played around with it. If 1 was super easy to use and 10 was the hardest I would peg it at a 5. They've simplified some things but expose some things like passing RNG to key creation and signing which I think could be abstracted. We could use it for some things but if you include openssl and lib sodium then you have everything ring exposes but faster in performance

Which ledger?

<p><strong>VipinB</strong> (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 13:42:34 GMT):<br/>
@manoj485 this is probably not the best channel for this question- if it is a specific ledger then ask in the appropriate channel i.e. #fabric #sawtooth  #burrow etc. Or #hyperledger-explorer

ZKLang regular meetings on Mondays are mentioned in the last minutes. 
What is the time and is it every Monday? Do you already have the calendar event?

@amundson do you have some time to discuss what you have in crypto-lib and consolidating that to the simple signature interface with me?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 10 Aug 2018 16:42:58 GMT):<br/>

This interface is sufficient for both fixed-length output hash functions and XOFs. Would it be preferable to have 2 interfaces? The difference appears in the signature of the `digest` method.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/crypto-lib?msg=j9RDF9Jjj54QN57Nj) @hartm When we need modular exponentiation or exponentiation of hash which is needed in creating domain pseudonyms in idemix
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 07:56:51 GMT):<br/>
@lovesh Are you using more than the explicit guarantees of a one-way function though (i.e., pseudorandomness of the output)?
</p>
<p><strong>manu</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 07:59:40 GMT):<br/>
we should maybe call it PRF instead
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 08:51:33 GMT):<br/>
@hartm Yes, we want the output to be pseudorandom.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 13:57:25 GMT):<br/>
@lovesh Manu is right here.  The output of one-way functions doesn't have to be pseudorandom.  This primitive isn't named correctly.
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 14:07:57 GMT):<br/>
@hartm @manu Alright, i will rename. Thanks
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 14:09:34 GMT):<br/>
@lovesh Are you using any properties besides pseudorandomness of the output?

<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 14:40:25 GMT):<br/>
@hartm No
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 14:43:23 GMT):<br/>
@lovesh OK, as Manu suggests, we should probably call it a PRF then.
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 15:00:07 GMT):<br/>
Rename one way function to PRF https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/z-mix/pull/13
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 16 Aug 2018 18:13:01 GMT):<br/>
@lovesh I just looked at your code again.  It doesn't look like you're computing a PRF since there's no secret key defined in your interface.  It looks like you're just computing g^x for some value x over a curve with a known generator g.  Can you explicitly define what you want to compute, and what properties you want the input and output to have?  Thanks!

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/crypto-lib?msg=WBic5M7hnxP78XRrC) @hartm The PRF's `new` method takes `args` which can contain the key. The objective is to have a function which takes an input in a certain group and can produce any output with equal probability in a group, preimage resistance is not an objective of this function
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 21 Aug 2018 15:07:07 GMT):<br/>
@lovesh  Is the input randomly chosen by an honest person or adversarially chosen by an attacker (or somewhere in between, i.e. the input is selected by an honest user but without full entropy)?  
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Tue, 21 Aug 2018 16:11:43 GMT):<br/>
@hartm Input can be chosen by anyone including an adversary, the input has to respect some constraints like being in a field
</p>

@manu @hartm @MALodder ^^^
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 22 Aug 2018 13:49:31 GMT):<br/>
If you mean that the output of the hashes could contain some extra bits to flag their respective fields, I think that would be unconventional. If you mean that the wrapping functions would add bits to the respective group hashes to avoid collisions in the two groups, I also don't think I've seen that. Totally open to the idea that I'm just not familiar or that you are suggesting something else.
I do see the use of domain separation within the keccak functions to avoid collisions between those hashes when the same inputs are used. e.g. sha3-384(1) != sha3-256(1)
</p>
<p><strong>manu</strong> (Wed, 22 Aug 2018 13:50:56 GMT):<br/>
I would do domain separation yes
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Wed, 22 Aug 2018 14:00:27 GMT):<br/>
@Dan You understood it correct. I have heard that domain separation is needed for security proofs, it might not be useful in a particular scenario but as a general practice you should. Or use a different hash function like sha2 for G1 and sha3 for G2 
</p>

@Dan @amundson can you please review the (PR)[https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/crypto-lib/pull/6#pullrequestreview-147585598] and let me know if this still works for you
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 18:38:01 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder is the plan to add another implementation here - https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/crypto-lib/tree/master/rust/src/signing , say sekp256k1_milagro.rs, that uses what you added to the libhl-crypto/ directory?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 18:39:44 GMT):<br/>
the plan is remove that folder and use https://github.com/mikelodder7/crypto-lib/tree/master/libhl-crypto/src/signatures
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 18:48:31 GMT):<br/>
ok, I thought we were going down a path of trying to keep the API sawtooth uses (with adjustments to make it better) so that it was fairly easy to adopt
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 18:50:55 GMT):<br/>
the test code in libhl-crypto/src/signatures/secp256k1.rs looks very secp256k1 specific; do you have an algorithm agnostic API in mind that projects would use?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 18:51:11 GMT):<br/>
(just referencing the tests because I was looking for examples)
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 18:51:31 GMT):<br/>
Like a context?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 18:51:40 GMT):<br/>
like the sawtooth signing API
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 18:52:01 GMT):<br/>
We could wrap any signature in a context like object
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 18:52:11 GMT):<br/>
the interface didn't change that much if you look at it
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 18:52:32 GMT):<br/>
Its like the simple signature interface that was signed off
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 18:52:42 GMT):<br/>
by the group
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 18:52:55 GMT):<br/>
it supports two versions, the native version and the portable version
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 18:53:06 GMT):<br/>
portable is milagro, native is libsecp256k1 version
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 18:56:31 GMT):<br/>
```let context = create_context("secp256k1").unwrap();
let factory = CryptoFactory::new(&*context);
let priv_key = Secp256k1PrivateKey::from_hex(KEY1_PRIV_HEX).unwrap();
let signer = factory.new_signer(&priv_key);
let signature = signer.sign(&String::from(MSG1).into_bytes()).unwrap();```
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 18:57:06 GMT):<br/>
so if we had that code today, what would that look like translated to this API?

```
let priv_key = secp256k1::Ecdsa256K1Sha256PrivateKey::from_hex(KEY1_PRIV_HEX).unwrap();
let signature = priv_key.sign(&String::from(MSG1).into_bytes()).unwrap()
```
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:03:15 GMT):<br/>
I see yours expects a hexit signature so to add another line
```
let final_sig = bin2hex(signature.as_slice());
```
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:04:12 GMT):<br/>
how are you sharing libsecp256k1 context between keys? context creation is super expensive. global variables?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:04:41 GMT):<br/>
each key has their own context
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:04:59 GMT):<br/>
its not quite as expensive if you say signing only or verify only
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:09:41 GMT):<br/>
but, presumably in your API the priv_key signing and pub_key has to do verification since you don't have a separation between the data object (a private key or public key) and the algorithm code (signer, verifier); so if you have a lot of public keys, you are going to end up with a lot of contexts, and that is going to be slow. The app would have to do smart caching of public keys especially as recreating them would be very bad indeed.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:11:28 GMT):<br/>
so you're assuming only one context is created and passed around am I right
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:12:57 GMT):<br/>
so, say I'm getting a transaction off the network and it's associated public key. I create the public_key object and then verify that transaction. Today within sawtooth, we don't cache any public key objects, because that is all very efficient since there is only one verifier (and context). If public key and verifier are the same, then I need to either take the efficiency hit (because of the creation of a context), or I need to cache public key objects so I can avoid recreating it. (Because it is likely to see the same public keys come up over and over, the caching would work but not something we need to do today.)
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:13:02 GMT):<br/>
the only other option would be to create a shared global variable
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:15:12 GMT):<br/>
I can do that
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:15:18 GMT):<br/>
which we rejected on principle (we would probably have to deal with side effects we can't describe easily before we run into them), which is why we create the context and derive a signer or verifier from it, and treat the key as just data until we need to use it. so we can pass the signer or verifier around when we startup the validator (once).
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:15:43 GMT):<br/>
the problem is that is very secp256k1 specific
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:16:25 GMT):<br/>
specifically libsecp256k1 specific
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:16:36 GMT):<br/>
milagro secp256k1 or openssl do not have this
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:16:56 GMT):<br/>
libsodium or secp384r1 libraries I've used don't use context either
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:21:46 GMT):<br/>
that just makes context creation a no-op for those implementations
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:22:11 GMT):<br/>
have you done any performance testing of milagro vs. libsecp256k1?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:22:14 GMT):<br/>
okay but now its complicating every other library
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:22:15 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:22:24 GMT):<br/>
libsecp256k1 is 4 times faster
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:23:20 GMT):<br/>
it's not complicating every other library. it is a slightly more complex API for the user of the API.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:25:28 GMT):<br/>
but even then, the lines above could be reduce to two with a convenience function for the users of the API that don't care about performance (or are only using algorithms where re-creating context is efficient)
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:33:05 GMT):<br/>
it just doesn't make sense to me to have every other class use a no-op 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:39:30 GMT):<br/>
what I'm saying is that its not necessary for those other libraries to do that. They don't require it. So to make every consumer of the crypto-lib create a context that does nothing for the 99% doesn't make sense to me so the 1% can be happy.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 Aug 2018 19:41:07 GMT):<br/>
I'd like to find another solution is what I'm saying

@amundson Regarding the `context` object, the constructor of the signature interface in z-mix `SignatureScheme`'s `new` method, https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/z-mix/blob/master/src/signatures/mod.rs#L25 can be used to create the context and then subsequent calls to sign and verify can be used to with different keys without re-creating the context object. 
There is sample code above in that file that should clarify my proposal

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 27 Aug 2018 16:12:40 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder I'm concerned about backward compatibility since Sawtooth has the SDKs at 1.0.x and we have committed to not breaking the API. We have a little flexibility with the Rust SDK, but we don't want it to substantially deviate from our other language SDKs too much, and we have quite a bit of code now that uses the Rust SDK so it is "almost 1.0".
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 27 Aug 2018 16:38:29 GMT):<br/>
I believe this won't change it too much
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 27 Aug 2018 20:52:17 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 19:48:23 GMT):<br/>
In the repo https://github.com/milagro-crypto/amcl/tree/master/version3/rust there is a python script config64.py. If you run that and select the same curves and rsa as I did you will get the same folder
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 28 Aug 2018 19:48:44 GMT):<br/>

has there been any conversation about BLS signature schemes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boneh%E2%80%93Lynn%E2%80%93Shacham) - they have some really useful properties for verifiable random functions and I would love to seem them in a solid library
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 29 Aug 2018 17:24:44 GMT):<br/>

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/crypto-lib?msg=bqT2YWTRocTsYS4ri) @silasdavis Hyperledger Indy crypto has BLS signatures (and they have been added in shared crypto lib) that use the BN-254 curve.

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 01:50:41 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder made some time to review today. It looks very close. I need to check whether we are using the existing (sawtooth) factory in a certain way, but even that might be irrelevant if its just wrapping this approach. And then I wasn't clear on how the secp256k1 context is managed. When we first adopted the bitcoin library we found that it didn't buy us nearly as much performance if we didn't hang onto the context and kept recreating it.
I have some other rambling thoughts about when sawtooth would adopt this and whether that would buy us any more flexibility.. like if at a major release we could alter some things if that was valuable and also maybe a good point to pick up edwards so impact of the secp library weirdness less important .. so yeah rambling thoughts. :) 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 01:52:21 GMT):<br/>
We manage the context with the Signaturescheme so it’s only created once
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 02:11:11 GMT):<br/>
I did implement ed25519 to compare against secp256k1
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 31 Aug 2018 14:09:12 GMT):<br/>
Yeah I saw that. Got me thinking about moving off of secp256k1 again.
I don't have my data anymore but I did some lightweight benchmarking on those two last year and ed25519 was faster than secp - but not wildly faster. Given some other risks and sdk availability for other languages we decided not to make the switch back then.

Can someone recommend a good reference for range proofs?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Sun, 09 Sep 2018 08:28:54 GMT):<br/>
What application do you have in mind, and do you want something general or specific?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 14:49:36 GMT):<br/>
I think this is one of the features for z-mix? So anything directly related to that would be good. Especially anything foundational. 
But in general it seems like checking in zero knowledge that a committed value is in range seems applicable all over blockchains. A trivial example .. we use a transaction family called intkey (integer key:value transactions) in a lot of our smoke tests. The main rule for those transactions is the resulting value has to be 0 <= n <= 2^32-1.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Mon, 10 Sep 2018 14:51:10 GMT):<br/>

@Dan RSA based range proofs have existed for awhile and Indy is using them for zero-knowledge proofs. There is some research into using elliptic curve based range proofs for bitcoin by [Dan Boneh et. al](https://crypto.stanford.edu/bulletproofs/)
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 11 Sep 2018 21:36:11 GMT):<br/>

</p>

more research needs to be done on elliptic curve based range proofs like cryptanalysis and time to bake but the initial results look good

Those aren't necessarily good introductions to the topic, but they will give you some background.  I don't think there is a survey paper specifically on range proofs, so those may be your best bet.

</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 14 Sep 2018 14:04:47 GMT):<br/>
is that because the zmix stuff requires less discussion now or because the newer meeting is just higher priority?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 14 Sep 2018 17:06:42 GMT):<br/>
By the way, I've updated the proposal document.

@tkuhrt could I ask you to update the calendar per @MALodder since I'm not here until Wednesday?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 14 Sep 2018 22:01:53 GMT):<br/>
Zmix stuff will be merged with the crypto lib meeting because there isn’t a lot more to add by having a separate meeting 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 14 Sep 2018 22:02:25 GMT):<br/>
@hartm after this doc is reviewed would it be ready for the TSC to vote?

I tried to join what I thought was the zmix/indy-crypto call on monday at 7am PT but there was only one chap on (who didn't seem to be listening... possibly he just wanted to ignore my poor russian.) :rocket: was down so there was no-one to ping here.
Looking at the HL Community calendar I only see an indy maintainers meeting on Mondays at 8am PT. @MALodder can you clarify the schedule and then maybe @dhuseby can add it to the community calendar (assuming I'm not just looking past it).
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 18:02:40 GMT):<br/>
@Dan I guess they used a different zoom than the Hyperledger community channel.  I was in the meeting--there were a bunch of people.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 18:04:22 GMT):<br/>
hmmm I must still have a bad invite then. My one-sided conversation in broken russian wasn't too interesting. well, I mean it was interesting to 100% of the participants but ..
Could we get that on the regular community calendar with a hyperledger-friendly zoom link? @dhuseby 
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 18:46:41 GMT):<br/>
@Dan let me see what I can do
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 19:02:52 GMT):<br/>
I believe in you!
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 20:54:19 GMT):<br/>
@Dan I can't add things to the Hyperledger Community Events calendar
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 20:54:37 GMT):<br/>
You should ping Tracy and Ry
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Tue, 25 Sep 2018 20:54:42 GMT):<br/>
that's what I'd be doing if I handled it
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 26 Sep 2018 13:09:08 GMT):<br/>
Oh sorry, thought you all had the same keys.
I still believe in you though. ;)
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 26 Sep 2018 13:10:10 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder can you coordinate your desired timeslot with @rjones and he can get you on the `official` calendar with an `official` _zoom_ link?

@MALodder @jsmitchell people are still having trouble getting libsodium installed on their mac's to try the cryptolib
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 14:48:44 GMT):<br/>
@jsmitchell there is a solution that @MALodder figured out to get libsodium installed on a mac
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 14:53:53 GMT):<br/>
It worked for me first time with `brew install`. If there are alternate instructions for those running into trouble, it would be good to drop them here
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 08 Oct 2018 15:01:02 GMT):<br/>
I put instructions in the README.md for both methods

</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 16 Oct 2018 18:24:53 GMT):<br/>
If it's a sovrin thing maybe that's out of scope for us. We could consider like a monthly call specifically for crypto-lib and really focus on trying to communicate asynch the rest of that time. See how that goes and if it isn't working then shoot for something higher frequency?
</p>

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 14:56:40 GMT):<br/>
correct me if I'm wrong
</p>
<p><strong>manu</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 14:57:07 GMT):<br/>
the name CL sig is a bit vague, as you could also call BBS+ a CL sig, so above I'd just say CL-RSA and then its clear
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 14:57:36 GMT):<br/>
EPID uses BN .. i guess it's a derivative of CL.
</p>
<p><strong>manu</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 14:58:13 GMT):<br/>
epid uses somewhat broken version of BBS+

oh interesting @manu .. what aspect is broken?
</p>
<p><strong>manu</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 15:08:39 GMT):<br/>
See https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/663.pdf section 2.2. In short, what EPID uses is a shortened BBS+ sig where one element is dropped which was introduced with an invalid security proof

</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 19:50:46 GMT):<br/>
Did dropping the element make it slightly broken?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 19:51:27 GMT):<br/>
And they said it was okay with a security proof that actually doesn’t work?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 17 Oct 2018 19:53:05 GMT):<br/>
That’s what I gather from your comments and the paper
</p>
<p><strong>manu</strong> (Thu, 18 Oct 2018 13:52:34 GMT):<br/>
Right, they removed a part of the signature and presented that with a security proof that is incorrect. So there is no reason to believe that the EPID signature is unforgeable, but I also don't immediately know how to forge them. 
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Oct 2018 18:25:11 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 18:42:19 GMT):<br/>
I was trying to review @MALodder 's PR and got sidetracked into the bowels of Milagro. Can someone remind me what our goal with that codebase is? Is it solely to provide a 0 dependency build option?
And looking at the milagro project itself I'm trying to discern the structure.. There's an amcl repo that seems to have all the languages and then there's a few peer level repos that are language specific. I'm guessing they are generated from the amcl repo and then have ... other stuff? 
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:31:49 GMT):<br/>
@Dan I assume you are talking about https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/crypto-lib/pull/13?  The goal is to modularize out the hash functions (and, in general, the symmetric key cryptography) since we have some potential users who have region-specific requirements for these.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:32:47 GMT):<br/>
Mike is taking his kids to Disney World this week so I'd suggest we can talk about this more next week (including at the crypto-lib meeting).
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 20:47:06 GMT):<br/>
Well that's the PR I started at but it had a milagro patch in it, which led me back to why we have milagro in there to begin with. So that's really more my question. Is milagro there purely for a no-dependency build? I think that's the reason but I want to make sure. 
Following from that I'm trying to assess the relative risk of the milagro project. I started poking around in there but wouldn't mind a map from someone who's been there before  - especially around the repo structure I mention above.  
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 23 Oct 2018 20:48:50 GMT):<br/>
Also I would like some Tonga Toast :bread:  so I can go into a carb coma. 
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 24 Oct 2018 00:08:39 GMT):<br/>
We need Milagro in order to build things for which there aren't standard libraries (i.e. threshold signatures).  It is also useful for no-dependency builds, but I think the primary reason is building functionalities for which there aren't implementations we can shim.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 24 Oct 2018 00:08:52 GMT):<br/>
If you're ever in the bay area, I can point you to a place with great french toast!

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 24 Oct 2018 14:58:00 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder @hartm @Dan FYI - some work being done on the sawtooth java sdk signing library currently to bring it to the same level as the rust/python sdks - https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-sdk-java/pull/5
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 24 Oct 2018 15:03:14 GMT):<br/>
re:milagro, I think we should move to a model were we don't check in generated code, but rather generate it as part of the project's build. otherwise, doing the code generation becomes a specialized non-repeatable task (except by specific people obviously)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Wed, 24 Oct 2018 15:05:08 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder did you previously mention some existing java JNA signing example code to look at?

Hi, can anyone recommend a good attribute based encryption library in Rust? thanks
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 20:33:05 GMT):<br/>
is this crypto-lib going to be one actually?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 29 Oct 2018 20:59:30 GMT):<br/>
@wip-abramson What kind of attribute-based encryption do you need?  I don't know of any existing libraries.
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 12:15:14 GMT):<br/>
I am just looking to play around with it, my professor mentioned it.  I looked at charm crypto but it doesnt seem to work and would prefer something in Rust. Just wanting to try something like this https://jhuisi.github.io/charm/charm/schemes/abenc/abenc_bsw07.html. I am still pretty new to all this so just trying to figure things out. 
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 12:15:24 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/Fraunhofer-AISEC/rabe this could be okay
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 12:21:27 GMT):<br/>
In terms of using or working with the crypto-lib as a dependency are there any examples of this? How would it be used? I would love to understand the code base better, is there a best way for me to do this? Struggling to get my head round it 
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 13:05:06 GMT):<br/>
crypto-lib is still in it's infancy.. or maybe gestation. :baby_symbol:  the code organization is still in flux.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 13:08:07 GMT):<br/>
If you want to see mature code organization maybe checkout openssl. I found libsnarks a little difficult to navigate but that's another project you might look at. More crypto novelty but the code organization is atypical - at least to me. Of course neither of those are rusty.  
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 14:46:13 GMT):<br/>
Okay, thanks Dan I will look into them. I am working towards understanding the cryptography used in hyperledger indy and more generally in identity systems so I figured the crypto-lib would be a good place to get involved. Ill keep working at it, still got a lot to learn with cryptography first
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 30 Oct 2018 14:55:22 GMT):<br/>
Ok, some of my suggestions might be tangents then. It's useful to see how other libraries are organized but maybe not central to your objective.

Some agenda items:

 

1.       Discuss the “tiering” process for implementations and any guidelines we want to have for this going forward.  Dan Middleton sent out an email about this earlier.

2.       Naming.  Are we happy with Ursa?  We need to straighten everything out with the marketing committee no matter what we decide.

3.       Final proposal edits/suggestions.  Is there anything we still need to change in light of recent discussion?

Please feel free to edit that as you all see fit.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:42:29 GMT):<br/>
To put a finer point on what I was proposing earlier for the config/attribute system is this:
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:43:40 GMT):<br/>
1) we define a set of standard "attributes" like:  designed in the open, experimental, government approved, etc
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:44:38 GMT):<br/>
2) every library under the ursa banner has an attributed that is the same as it's name (e.g. the "sodium" attribute selects for libsodium)
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:46:06 GMT):<br/>
3) we define pre-determined, common configurations that are combinations of attributes of the #2 type (e.g. open_strong == blake2 + sodium)
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:47:08 GMT):<br/>
The way I envision it being used by a consumer is to say: open_strong - blake2 + sha3 + zksnarks
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:47:56 GMT):<br/>
or: fips_compliant + zksnarks
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:49:13 GMT):<br/>
The attributes described as #1 are just lists of libraries under the ursa banner that have that attribute
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 31 Oct 2018 17:50:04 GMT):<br/>
so I could define my config as "government_approved" and I would get all of the NIST and Chinese govt approved primitives
</p>

@adamgering once the project has an official incubation project, I can imagine it will in the future. The first thing we need to do is get a CI/CD pipeline being built for Rust. Next would be the wrappers like python

@MALodder @adamgering  We have been approved for incubation (happened at the meeting last Thursday).  We are just waiting on final approval from legal for the name (which we need for repo creation).
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 06 Nov 2018 03:18:48 GMT):<br/>
@adamgering I think for the near term, you are fine to rely on the sawtooth python signing package. The API's align closely. What we have in crypto-lib || ursa now is only a rust interface. My intent is that Ursa will replace all the sawtooth signing libraries. That probably won't happen for a quarter or so though. I'm not sure exactly the timeline but we want to get Ursa stable and then tested with Sawtooth before we make big changes.

Hyperledger Ursa is a shared cryptographic library that would enable people (and projects) to avoid duplicating other cryptographic work and hopefully increase security in the process. The library would be an opt-in repository for projects (and, potentially others) to place and use crypto.

</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 22:41:10 GMT):<br/>
@tkuhrt I believe Dan said we needed two repos, hyperledger/ursa and hyperledger/ursa-rfcs
</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Mon, 12 Nov 2018 23:27:13 GMT):<br/>
@hartm : Let us know. We will wait until we hear from you. We will also need to understand if we are moving the labs repos or archiving them.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 01:38:50 GMT):<br/>
I think we move crypto-lib to ursa or do we want ursa-lib? And then yes, we'll want an rfc repo. What do you guys what to do with zmix? Is that ursa-zmix or does it stay in the lab until some milestone?

Or do we just commit the zmix directory tree into the ursa-lib repo? 
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 01:39:57 GMT):<br/>
I think the decision kind of depends on evolving the tier concept. (division by namespace, path, etc. ?)
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 13 Nov 2018 16:06:42 GMT):<br/>
I believe we want to incorporate Zmix, but, as Dan points out, clearly separate it from the base signature/symmetric primitive library (because it is, in fact, a separate tier by our definitions, and most people will be less confident in its security).  I know very little about build processes compared to some people on this channel.  How do you all want to do it?  @Dan @MALodder @amundson @binhn.

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 16:56:11 GMT):<br/>
I don't think we discussed yet, but yeah I think jira is the conventional path for HL projects.
maybe the variant that our projects have both been using is this rfc process that is a predecessor of creating a user story / epic in jira for new features .. esp features that impact APIs.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 16 Nov 2018 17:28:18 GMT):<br/>
We haven't discussed this yet in meetings.  Someone brought it up near the end of our last meeting, but we didn't have time to discuss it and decided it was a large enough topic that we should defer it to later.

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Sun, 18 Nov 2018 11:56:41 GMT):<br/>

can I be added please?

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 30 Nov 2018 17:33:41 GMT):<br/>
I also don't appear to have what I would consider maintainer level permissions on either repo.
On a related point, for repo configuration, I recommend copying the settings from Sawtooth as I know that's dialed in for things like requiring +2 reviewers on PR, no force pushing etc. I imagine that @jwagantall would not have gotten that direction.

In general we should all issue tickets so that it's clear exactly what is being asked and who is doing it. Project genesis is maybe a little different because there is a lot of process that the Community Architects need to facilitate (has there been a TSC vote, who are the documented maintainers who would otherwise have issued the ticket, etc etc).

</p>
<p><strong>tkuhrt</strong> (Fri, 30 Nov 2018 17:39:41 GMT):<br/>
@Dan : You are also a maintainer. This gives write access to the two repositories. I know that we were removing Admin permissions from groups going forward. cc: @Silona

</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 30 Nov 2018 17:41:22 GMT):<br/>
I think that means we also can't do things like create branches which is a pretty fundamental thing for a maintainer to do. Ry has earlier sensitized me to the issues caused by lack of granularity in github's permissioning model. I do think that despite those challenges, it's appropriate for maintainers to have admin access to their repos.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 30 Nov 2018 18:08:38 GMT):<br/>
  @tkuhrt Yes I do now
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 30 Nov 2018 20:08:43 GMT):<br/>
I agree with @Dan, at least a few of the maintainers should have admin
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 30 Nov 2018 21:02:09 GMT):<br/>
We should but which ones
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 30 Nov 2018 21:11:13 GMT):<br/>
One criteria is who is involved in release mechanics
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 30 Nov 2018 21:13:36 GMT):<br/>
Ideally, the most responsible people (which for this basically means people that will not disable or circumvent DCO, because that's about the only thing you could do wrong)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 30 Nov 2018 21:17:05 GMT):<br/>
There are good reasons for it not to be a large group, because you really do have to be sensitive to the fact that there is a small amount of overlap between things the HL folks would do and the things project repo admins might do, and they should never be in conflict. Like 3-4 folks at most, IMO.

Sawtooth Github Permissions and Settings
----------------------------------------

Sawtooth has many repositories in Hyperledger's github organization, which all
follow similar permissioning rules.

Repositories generally have the following groups:

- The "Sawtooth Core Admins" group consisting of a very small number of
  individuals who have admin priviliges on that specific repository. The
  bar for adding new members to this group is very high. (In the future, this
  group could be renamed "Sawtooth Admins".)
- A repository-specific maintainers group with write permissions, which should
  match the maintainers list in MAINTAINERS.md. Rules governing maintainership
  are defined by Sawtooth's governance documentation (in the sawtooth-rfcs
  repo), and new maintainers are voted in by existing maintainers. Pattern
  always fits the pattern "Sawtooth X Maintainers", where X is derived from
  the name of the repository, such as "Core" for sawtooth-core.
- The "Sawtooth Core Contributors" group, which has read permissions.
  Membership in this group need only meet a low threshold, and its general
  purpose is allowing additional reviewers to be added to the repositories. It
  includes all Sawtooth contributors, regardless of were they have contributed.
  (In the future, this group should be renamed "Sawtooth Contributors".)
- A repository-specific committers group, which allows additional
  non-maintainers to be added with write permissions. Generally, this should
  never be done, because it is very confusing from a github approvals
  perspective. However, it can be used to grandfather in write permissions.

This, most repositories will have exactly three groups: admin, maintainer,
and contributor.

A 'sawtooth-build' user is commonly added as a collaborator - this is for
Sawtooth Jenkins integration. No other collaborators are commonly added.

In addition to groups, the following settings apply to each repository:

- Features:
  - Wikis: Unchecked - Sawtooth components use sphinx-doc (usually located in
    docs/, README.md, etc.). Facilitates project goal of maintaining
    high-quality peer-reviewed documentation.
  - Restrict editing to users in teams with push access only: Unchecked
  - Issues: Unchecked - Sawtooth components use Hyperledger JIRA. Helps
    facilitates cross-component issues.
  - Projects: Unchecked - Sawtooth components use Hyperledger JIRA.
- Data services:
  - Vulnerability alerts: Checked
- Merge button:
  - Allow merge commits: Checked
  - Allow squash merging: Unchecked - Facilitates project-level goal of good
    commits (https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/); part of peer review
    includes commit granularity and messages.
  - Allow rebase merging: Checked
- GitHub Pages
  - Source - None - Project does not use GitHub Pages
- Branches
  - Default branch: master
  - Branch protection rules: At least one rule is required here, usually
    applied to '*'.
    - Require pull request reviews before merging": Checked
      - Required approving reviews: 2
      - Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed:
        Unchecked
      - Require review from Code Owners: Unchecked
      - Restrict who can dismiss pull request reviews: Unchecked
    - Require status checks to pass before merging": Checked
      - DCO: Checked - This is required by HL rules and must always be enabled.
      - other: commonly continuous-integration/jenkins checks related to
        Jenkins integration
    - Required signed commits: Unchecked
    - Include administrators: Checked - very important due overlap between
      developers and "Sawtooth Core Admins" group
    - Restrict who can push to matching branches: Unchecked
  - Webhooks:
    - JIRA integration (not consistently applied)
    - RocketChat integration (broken - meant to post a message to
      #sawtooth-pr-review)

<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 30 Nov 2018 21:26:17 GMT):<br/>
it has been helpful to have CODEOWNERS set such that it adds all maintainers as reviewers by default (we are still rolling that out for the Sawtooth repos, but its worked well were we have it)

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 30 Nov 2018 23:55:08 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 30 Nov 2018 23:56:14 GMT):<br/>
Clearly, though, we need github to implement threshold cryptography so that we can allow admin actions with k out of n maintainers signing off!

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 05 Dec 2018 14:35:47 GMT):<br/>
There's that wrappers directory? I wasn't sure if that was intentional as it's not part of crypto-lib.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 05 Dec 2018 14:47:58 GMT):<br/>
For now I plan to leave it and later expand it so ursa can use it

</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 18 Dec 2018 17:43:16 GMT):<br/>
cool. so looks like we can now import a crate from amcl rather than copying in the code that had been generated by amcl?

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 18 Dec 2018 18:29:10 GMT):<br/>
yes, the indy team helped amcl to do that

I did a `rustup update` after it failed the first time followed by a `cargo clean`.

<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Tue, 18 Dec 2018 20:53:53 GMT):<br/>
has ursa moved to rust 2018?
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Tue, 18 Dec 2018 20:55:02 GMT):<br/>
they changed the default allocator recently
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Tue, 18 Dec 2018 20:55:10 GMT):<br/>
and it looks like those symbols might be related to that
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Tue, 18 Dec 2018 20:59:20 GMT):<br/>
have you tried building it on nightly to see if the behavior is different?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 18 Dec 2018 21:00:42 GMT):<br/>
I haven't. But before I dig around too much.. @MALodder what version are you at?
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Tue, 18 Dec 2018 21:04:02 GMT):<br/>
`rustup install nightly; cargo +nightly build`
</p>
<p><strong>jsmitchell</strong> (Tue, 18 Dec 2018 21:04:15 GMT):<br/>
that lets you test that without changing any of your environment defaults
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 18 Dec 2018 21:12:32 GMT):<br/>
its caused from the FFI stuff

hello all, like to enquire when will be the monthly ursa call? - Nathan Aw from Singapore 
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 06:58:26 GMT):<br/>
@mervecankus I don't think anyone is planning on implementing HE in Ursa in the near future, although I don't know for sure.  At least for most of us (or, for the people that I know about), functional encryption is tied much more closely to our crypto-related use cases than HE.  It's also much more challenging to build for general functionalities than HE.  As @JonGeater asks, what use case do you have in mind for HE?  We are curious here.  
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 02 Jan 2019 06:58:42 GMT):<br/>
@nathanaw It's biweekly.  The next call is a week from now on the 9th.

I'd love to see some libraries that utilize the Intel SGX secure enclave.
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 14:55:30 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/ursa?msg=4ttyAam2M9Mbhxfab) @adamgering Wouldn't we all :-)  There are multiple angles to this though: architecturally do we want to have a top level interface that knows the difference between enclave and non-enclave implementaions?  Or have a build option that creates different flavoured builds of the same interface? Or simply have people who care deploy the library into an enclave themselves?

And then there's the management angle: if the enclave functionality is somehow pre-created by Ursa, who signs it?

And also what about other types of enclave?  I could put code in a Secure Element, for example, talkig over GP protocols or SCP11 or something.  Or in ARM TrustZone or RISC-V containers.  At what layer of a shared crypto library do we expose conscious knowledge of these differences?

This could the subject of quite deep discussion, which has started already - Hart and others can probably point to meeting archives where it's been discussed already so we can all get up to speed with the group's thinking on the matter.
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 14:56:19 GMT):<br/>
I also want to mod Sawtooth to be able to use general HSMs and ARM TrustZone in additional to SGX for PoET, but that's a different matter
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 20:07:01 GMT):<br/>
@JonGeater Amen, let me add to that. I think the key management side of it could be done with Ursa to start, where you would pass a key id or key reference for basic crypto operations like signing and key wrapping. The complicated stuff you mention I believe would require many discussions and probably be more advanced features of ursa eventually. 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 04 Jan 2019 20:08:35 GMT):<br/>
I don't think enclaves are as simple as people think, when they say can it use the enclave, what does that mean? Does it mean the entire crypto operation for calculating a zero knowledge proof in order to keep the data protected, or does it mean simpler stuff like key management

<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 18:47:14 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder I am writing the build configuration RFC and the build configuration tool RFC and discovered something that might be a PITA about cargo.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 18:47:36 GMT):<br/>
you can't have build scripts in a workspace root and have it get executed separate from the workspace members
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 18:48:26 GMT):<br/>
that means, if you want to do conditional compilation of a workspace (e.g. specify which packages do and do not get build) we have to make our own custom cargo sub-command
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 18:49:58 GMT):<br/>
I was already planning on creating cargo-cfg custom subcommand to execute a tool similar to the make menuconfig in the linux kernel. the proposal is to have a tool that gives a nice interface to selecting the components and features included in a build of Ursa. The output from cargo-cfg is a build configuration file that I was going to use as the inputs for a top-level workspace build script
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 18:50:17 GMT):<br/>
but a top-level workspace build script isn't a thing
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 18:51:53 GMT):<br/>
so I'm now considering also creating cargo-bygge (Norwegian for build) or cargo-schnell or something named like that, that will take a build configuration file and execute cargo in the workspace root with the correct command line arguments (e.g. cargo build -p z-mix --features=....)
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 18:52:14 GMT):<br/>
what do you think?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 10 Jan 2019 18:53:05 GMT):<br/>
I've written quite a lot in the build RFC and will shelve it until I get feedback...sending this also to the list.

</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 11 Jan 2019 00:11:46 GMT):<br/>
agree with this as long as builds are reproducible without creating or moving files around
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 11 Jan 2019 00:12:10 GMT):<br/>
@Dan this is an interesting paper, https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/023.pdf
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 11 Jan 2019 00:12:44 GMT):<br/>
since Sawtooth uses secp256k1, you might consider double checking that this doesn't affect you
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 11 Jan 2019 00:13:20 GMT):<br/>
I think you should be okay since you are using the bitcoin library so the nonces should be generated properly

lol. foreshadow is old news ;)
In general though defense in depth is always good. Mic has some good sgx patterns. For example, in poet, we use a z-test to make sure that if an enclave is broken it can't run amok.. if it wins statistically improbably often then the other nodes distrust it.
For key management the risk model is easier.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 11 Jan 2019 22:07:09 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, Mike, you're a couple of papers behind ;)
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 11 Jan 2019 22:09:16 GMT):<br/>
Lots of people here at RWC are wondering about SGX stuff, though.
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Sat, 12 Jan 2019 21:32:09 GMT):<br/>
EVeryone knew SGX v1 was broken before it was released.  V2 became very questionable after release.  V3's the charm :-)
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Sat, 12 Jan 2019 21:33:02 GMT):<br/>
Seriously, *no* enclave technology will be fully foolproof.  As long as there are APIs there will be attacks.  If there's a common bus then you get what you pay for, 
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Sat, 12 Jan 2019 21:34:09 GMT):<br/>
The advance that we need now is in system thinking understand what the enclave *can* do for you, and designing around those promises.  Many great heroes died searching for the grail.  It ain't there.

```** Process for ursa-rfcs

   1. Declare in ursa-rfcs the exact dependencies that your change will bring
      in

      a) give a brief explanation on why you need the dependency
      b) include link to the dependencies
      c) how you will handle upgrades 
      d) dependency must come from crates
      e) if using external library include steps on how to use it 
      d) no nightly dependencies can be brought include

   2. Dependency must have an Apache 2.0 license  or MIT 3.

** Process for PR in ursa 

   1. highest level of review 
      a. any change to the rust code
      b. any change to dependency
      c. 

   2. mid tier level of review 
      a. adding new wrapper or modifying new one 
      b. ci/cd pipeline changes

  
   
   

** Process for CI

   1. Dependency must come from crates.io
      a) this means that the dependency cannot be pulling and building from
         a github repo
   2. No nightly dependencies will be accepted ```

<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 04:12:09 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder why the requirement for packages coming from crates.io?

</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 07:16:15 GMT):<br/>
@dhuseby It's because the crates that go into crates.io have been looked at by people like RustSec and are accepted by the community. 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 14:58:05 GMT):<br/>
@cam-parra there are some exceptions to this rule, if you look in ursa I had to make a package that is local to ursa that wraps a crate
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 14:59:38 GMT):<br/>
The statement about requiring crates should be the norm but not required. If a dependency is not at crates.io there should be a justification for it

@david.b.crypto there shouldn't be another channel for indy-crypto. Indy-crypto is now considered legacy. @MALodder correct me if I am wrong but you'd like all the sovrin crypto conversations to stay here correct?

any help to solve it?

<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Wed, 23 Jan 2019 21:29:31 GMT):<br/>
@cam-parra this is  do-ocracy. to become a maintainer, I suggest you pick a part of Ursa that interests you and volunteer to take responsibility for it.  Ursa by its very nature is modular.  If there isn't an obvious module you want to own, we can come up with maintenance tasks that you can work on. Submitting and landing PR's is how you get maintainer status.

@rjones Thanks!  Will do.

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 03:48:54 GMT):<br/>
@Hezaveh  what version of rust are you running `rustup show`
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 07:00:06 GMT):<br/>
@hartm @MALodder have you put any more thought into what a "pluggable"? hashing API should look like? we are doing some work were we could adopt and/or work on it if we had an idea of what the design should look like.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 07:01:09 GMT):<br/>
(as in, allowing the hashing algorithm to be swapped easily, etc.)
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 07:13:12 GMT):<br/>
@amundson I believe that @dhuseby has been preparing an RFC for this.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 07:14:08 GMT):<br/>
There is some pretty interesting stuff we can do around this.  Check this paper out:  https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/770
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 12:40:31 GMT):<br/>
@dhuseby I can take responsibility for URSA wrappers and security and culture of the repo. Basically the smaller tasks that don't require a Cryptographer 
</p>
<p><strong>Hezaveh</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 12:53:18 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder rustc 1.32.0 (9fda7c223 2019-01-16)
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 15:01:59 GMT):<br/>
@Hezaveh interesting, I'm running rust 1.31 and I don't see that error. Let me upgrade to that and see if I reproduce it
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 15:04:16 GMT):<br/>
@amundson yes some work has been done already in ursa but I'm not entirely sold on it and would love to work with you to improve it
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 15:05:30 GMT):<br/>
@Hezaveh try running this command and recompiling
`rustup component add clippy`
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 16:25:11 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder @dhuseby ok, I'm looking at this - https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/blob/master/libursa/src/hash/mod.rs - if there are some thoughts on making this better, even if its rough ideas, maybe I can work that in.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 16:26:32 GMT):<br/>
any thoughts on starting to publish ursa as a crate? If I start to pull it in, I'd like to be able to pin the version as presumably these APIs aren't stable yet.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 16:46:15 GMT):<br/>
@amundson yeah We definitely want to publish as a crate. The question becomes who does this
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 16:51:36 GMT):<br/>
I could probably find someone to help from my team, that does it for sawtooth, if that's what you mean.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 16:52:49 GMT):<br/>
what we did for sawtooth is set it up so multiple people have access to the create so it's not just one person, but in practice it is usually one or two people doing the process
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Thu, 24 Jan 2019 16:52:49 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 01:11:58 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 01:12:27 GMT):<br/>
Hey everybody, we have our JIRA project set up now: https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/URSA/
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 01:13:06 GMT):<br/>
to answer your question: we're not using Github issues because they don't support confidential security bugs which are required for our responsible disclosure policy
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 01:13:27 GMT):<br/>
I will be setting up a bot that will auto-close any github issues filed and tell the submitter to go to our JIRA to file bugs.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 01:13:37 GMT):<br/>
the bot was written by a volunteer on the Iroha team
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 09:41:35 GMT):<br/>
From past experience working on INDY I would suggest that all who do submit bugs  try to submit steps to reproduce and logs. The more details we get from the reporter the easier it makes it for the volunteers to fix. Also if you have the experience and the time it's best to report assign to yourself and fix the bug :) 
</p>
<p><strong>Silona</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 18:15:33 GMT):<br/>
Also @dhuseby 's security bug process... https://wiki2.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Security+Bug+Process 
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Fri, 25 Jan 2019 19:19:53 GMT):<br/>
@dhuseby why don't you just turn off github issues?

Thanks @VipinB ! Enjoyed the read 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 15:00:14 GMT):<br/>
@Hezaveh here's what you could do to see if you can compile. Delete the lines that have the text `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]`
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 15:00:29 GMT):<br/>
then try to compile and see if you still get the error
</p>
<p><strong>Hezaveh</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 15:18:37 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder It worked. Thank yoy. I basically commented these lines:  #[allow(clippy::many_single_char_names)] 
#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)] 
#[allow(clippy::not_unsafe_ptr_arg_deref)]  
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 15:19:07 GMT):<br/>
@Hezaveh glad to hear that, but still confused as to why that doesn't work for you
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 15:19:23 GMT):<br/>
why does clippy intefere with your build
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 15:19:30 GMT):<br/>
I'll have to investigate that one
</p>
<p><strong>Hezaveh</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 15:20:26 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder Thanks again. 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 15:20:39 GMT):<br/>
@Hezaveh no problem
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 16:27:51 GMT):<br/>
@amundson Whats the best way to setup the rust crate for ursa so multiple people can publish?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 16:50:53 GMT):<br/>
@amundson we have a bot we are deploying that auto-closes github issues and directs reporters to the HL JIRA.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 16:51:15 GMT):<br/>
that's for existing projects that have github issues that are informative and shouldn't be lost forever.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 16:51:23 GMT):<br/>
if we turn off GH issues, old issues disappear
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 16:51:30 GMT):<br/>
for new projects like Ursa we can disable them
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 16:51:48 GMT):<br/>
but then we need to document in the README.md that issues should be filed in the JIRA
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 16:52:06 GMT):<br/>
personally, I like the idea of not disabling GH issues and using the bot, even on new projects like URsa
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 16:52:26 GMT):<br/>
that way we're actively targeting bug reporters with the message: hey, please file bugs in JIRA
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Mon, 28 Jan 2019 22:42:54 GMT):<br/>
@dhuseby has the disadvantage that you let people enter bugs in the wrong place, with kind of a slap after they do it.

@MALodder crates.io supports that pretty nicely

I responded. However, I think the variations in color cloud the issue. I'd prefer to vote on the concept, and then vote on color separately. Otherwise I think you may get color variations watering down the weight of a concept.

<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 20:12:58 GMT):<br/>
this second batch comes from a logo marketplace

<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 01 Feb 2019 20:13:11 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 15:20:35 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, I think the marketing committee would not be thrilled if we started a twitter account without telling them.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 15:23:02 GMT):<br/>
We can reach out to them, but I would be surprised if they let us have a twitter that "officially" spoke for a project.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 15:27:27 GMT):<br/>
You can ask though, if you like.
</p>

@here So there was some last minute voting going on yesterday so I waited until this morning to put together the last survey. There were clear winners from both batches that I have put together into one last poll. Please vote today and come to the meeting tomorrow morning to discuss the final logo decision. Here's the final survey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YWGSSTT
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 18:18:14 GMT):<br/>
I included the other colors of the Bear+Star logo because collectively, they got the most votes for both first and second choice
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 18:18:28 GMT):<br/>
if the BearStar logo wins, then we'll have to decide on the color.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Tue, 05 Feb 2019 18:24:27 GMT):<br/>
@here VOTE TODAY: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/YWGSSTT

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Sat, 09 Feb 2019 23:30:58 GMT):<br/>
@JonGeater No.  Maybe ask Mike?  It's technically the "Sovrin crypto meeting" but really only covers Hyperledger stuff at this point.
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Sun, 10 Feb 2019 17:54:15 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 11 Feb 2019 19:23:20 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder Is there anything Sovrin-specific left in this meeting?  Sure, there are applications that Sovrin wants to build, but all of this is being done in the open and many other people are interested in these applications.  Should we rebrand this as the zmix meeting?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 11 Feb 2019 19:23:50 GMT):<br/>
hmmm, yes like anonymous read/write to the ledger
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 11 Feb 2019 19:23:52 GMT):<br/>
Also, unfortunately, I can't make tomorrow's meeting--I have an appointment with the shoulder surgeon.  Hopefully he will let me do more stuff.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 11 Feb 2019 19:23:57 GMT):<br/>
consensus stuff
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 11 Feb 2019 19:24:10 GMT):<br/>
so its not all zmix
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 11 Feb 2019 19:24:18 GMT):<br/>
alot of it is zmix though
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 11 Feb 2019 19:24:23 GMT):<br/>
Anonymous read/write to the ledger is definitely in the crypto purview, so that would count as zmix.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 11 Feb 2019 19:24:55 GMT):<br/>
As far as I know, we haven't discussed pure consensus in quite some time.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 11 Feb 2019 19:36:19 GMT):<br/>
that is true
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 11 Feb 2019 19:36:41 GMT):<br/>
tomorrow I want to discuss TEE and HSMs. That's an ursa item but how it applies to Sovrin
</p>

@dhuseby is this the paper that came up in the Sovrin crypto call today? https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ianopolous/Peergos/master/papers/wuala-cryptree.pdf

<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Tue, 12 Feb 2019 21:30:41 GMT):<br/>

Tahoe-LAFS uses a variant of Cryptree
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Tue, 12 Feb 2019 21:31:38 GMT):<br/>
there was a ton of great technology that came out of the Wuala project...to bad La Cie bought it to kill it : /
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Tue, 12 Feb 2019 21:32:28 GMT):<br/>
the other key piece of tech is their ungamable, decentralized reputation system called Havelaar: http://netecon.seas.harvard.edu/NetEcon06/Papers/gromilund_06.pdf
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Tue, 12 Feb 2019 21:33:00 GMT):<br/>
I think havelaar would be a nice addition to any consensus network for judging reliability of nodes
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Tue, 12 Feb 2019 21:33:36 GMT):<br/>
it could be used to incetivize reliability by weighting consensus votes by uptime
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Tue, 12 Feb 2019 21:38:23 GMT):<br/>
@nage BTW, I have a toy implementation of Cryptree in Python using PyNaCl primitives somewhere in my backups
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Tue, 12 Feb 2019 21:38:50 GMT):<br/>
it's just a library of classes that handle the key links and the data structure itself
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Tue, 12 Feb 2019 22:58:34 GMT):<br/>
_looks forward to talking about this some more in the Crypto calls and in Hong Kong_
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 13 Feb 2019 23:22:47 GMT):<br/>
I like cryptree, its similar but better to ideas I had for a wallet
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 16:05:21 GMT):<br/>
So where did everyone go? I haven't seen or heard any comments or anything for PRs on RFCs or the repo
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 16:08:21 GMT):<br/>
Is there an opinion for which documentation framework we should use for Ursa?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 16:09:03 GMT):<br/>
readthedocs, gitbook?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 16:10:16 GMT):<br/>
readme.io, gelato.io?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 16:14:27 GMT):<br/>
I've been looking at mdBook and quite like it
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 16:15:29 GMT):<br/>
Also would it make sense to create a separate repo for documentation called ursa-docs
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 14 Feb 2019 16:31:12 GMT):<br/>

@JonGeater for interfaces to HSM's and TPMs, do they mostly use PKCS11 or have they evolved to a different API description?
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 11:27:20 GMT):<br/>
Both
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 11:28:46 GMT):<br/>
PKCS#11 is not particularly good in its own right but it does allow interop for relatively trivial use cases so everybody supports it as a pluggable interface for application interop, but everybody also promotes their own interfaces for more nuanced operations, especially where complex administrative oiperations or shared key management comes into the frame
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 11:30:13 GMT):<br/>
TPM is so very far away from PKCS#11 that it's almost not worth doing, but it does just about work to crudely map enough of the basic functions to make key gen, wrap/unwrap, and sign operations work
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 11:31:58 GMT):<br/>
For HSMs it really depends who we're looking at.  The old Crysalis tokens and some smartcards did do PKCS#11 natively, although note that complex things like changing ACLs, making bacups and so on tended to use extensions and out-of-band operations even so.  nCipher and Utimaco are wrappers (and so you have to look REALLY carefully for security gaps between the interfaces)
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 11:33:18 GMT):<br/>
Lastly, we've had KMIP for 10 years now, so that should be considered too.  PKCS#11 V3 out of OASIS is quite well integraed with KMIP, and is (as a consequence) rather diffreent to PKCS#11 V2.x.  I'd argue it's a lot better in most ways, but unfortauntely it's going to take a very long time before people adopt it
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Tue, 19 Feb 2019 16:36:55 GMT):<br/>
PKCS#11 is hardware token based and the API could be cumbersome with sessions and all. But it is a common API to all the hardware that you mention, along with networked KMIP.

<p><strong>david.b.crypto</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 17:08:07 GMT):<br/>
are we in a position where we can crate that stuff with ffi?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 17:16:25 GMT):<br/>
so I created a crate for dev purposes already
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 17:16:37 GMT):<br/>
and we already expose the CL stuff with an FFI
</p>

I'm working writing documentation for all of this
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 17:17:08 GMT):<br/>
the decision yesterday was to create a separate repo for that documention `ursa-docs`
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 21 Feb 2019 17:17:24 GMT):<br/>
@hartm was looking into getting that started
</p>

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 26 Feb 2019 03:53:44 GMT):<br/>
@JonGeater Sovrin has investigated decentralized revocation registries or policies controlled by the user to essentially allow a user to authorize and revoke devices under their control and prove authorization in zero-knowledge. A policy is created by a user, the only information on the ledger in the policy is authorized public keys for various permissions. E.g. a user puts in three keys, one for each device perse uses, a laptop, a phone, and a tablet. When user presents ZKPs for anonymous credentials, perse also presents a proof that the device itself is authorized. Which policy is used is not revealed (which be correlatable if it was). When a device is lost or compromised, the user can revoke the bad device which halts an attacker from presenting valid proofs. The user can modify the policy to allow various permissions like 2 out of 3 devices are needed to add a new device but 1 out of 3 to revoke. This makes it harder for an attacker who manages to take over a device thru brute force or coercion to authorize his own new devices into the domain.

Could this concept be applied to decentralize hardware based attestations by manufacturers? Basically we can have CRLs on the ledger and do proofs in zero knowledge. We talked about the need for decentralization in this area on the last Sovrin call.  We plan to discuss this further on the Sovrin crypto call tomorrow https://zoom.us/j/567114224 at 8AM MST.

@JonGeater Are you planning to attend the Sovrin Crypto tomorrow? I wanted to discuss the possibility of using Sovrin as a DPKI for hardware and TEE attestations and what would be required for that
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Mon, 11 Mar 2019 21:16:28 GMT):<br/>
Yes
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Mon, 11 Mar 2019 21:16:46 GMT):<br/>
Wait...depends.  We're on a weird timezone week aren't we?
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Mon, 11 Mar 2019 21:17:55 GMT):<br/>
Is it still 07:00 Pacific?
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Mon, 11 Mar 2019 21:18:09 GMT):<br/>
If so I can do the first half hour: that'll be 14:00-14:30 for me this week

@JonGeater It's still 7:00 AM Pacific, but note the daylight savings time change.
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Mon, 11 Mar 2019 21:18:53 GMT):<br/>
Yes perfect.  That oplays in our favour this time
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Mon, 11 Mar 2019 21:20:45 GMT):<br/>
I can do 14:00-14:30.  Question, to let it sit in my mind for a bit: do you mean specifically GlobalPlatform TEE (meaning complying with GP specs for attestation, TSM and so on) or just generally attesting to some abstractly understood Root of Trust for a general secure enclave? 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 11 Mar 2019 21:44:14 GMT):<br/>
Well the problem as you stated was central authorities for enclave quotes
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 11 Mar 2019 21:44:54 GMT):<br/>
could Sovrin be the DPKI for attestations, meaning instead of Intel having control over EPID, they could put it on Sovrin and then its decentralized
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 11 Mar 2019 21:46:29 GMT):<br/>
@JonGeater Okay, I'll schedule the first part of the meeting to cover the TEE and HSM stuff
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Tue, 12 Mar 2019 10:37:20 GMT):<br/>
Right.  So yes we can define a model for that for people to sign up to.  Many won't want to as extracting a toll fee (or 'prime real estate' in the MNO world) is core to their business model.  But some will, and I think it's a good thing for us to do
</p>

While I switch out my network connection, you're onto a good thing with the credential profile.  Almost all TEE use cases end up just being a way of securing a cryptographic ID for end-to-end protocols

Hey, I missed the last couple of Sovrin calls and noticed on the agenda you have been discussing delegatable credentials. I have heard of multiple ways to do with and have recently been reading https://acmccs.github.io/papers/p683-camenischA.pdf. Is this something sovrin are considering implementing? And can anyone point me to any other literature around delegating credentials, especially around and different approaches to it. 
Thanks :)
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 10:57:47 GMT):<br/>
In this paper it mentions the ability to sign transactions with a delegated credential. So would it also be possible to issue further credentials using a delegated credential to create the signature? 
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Thu, 14 Mar 2019 12:09:17 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/ursa?msg=GbvnPrBeHSyKouuz8) @wip-abramson That paper the is best i have seen on delegatable credentials. Our current and the upcoming signature scheme will not be compatible with the scheme mentioned in this paper. We have been considering using a generic proving system like using SNARKs or Bulletproofs (Arithematic circuits), there is no paper about this approach yet.

@here should we be sending somebody from Ursa to the zkproof.org meeting in a few weeks?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 15 Mar 2019 21:19:12 GMT):<br/>
I'm going
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Fri, 15 Mar 2019 22:41:57 GMT):<br/>
I created a Ursa microbenchmark for SHA-512 and SHA-256 here https://github.com/danintel/ursaspeed
For SHA-512 and 16Kbyte buffers, I improved ursa performance 173x running on my laptop by using crate ring (which uses Google's BoringSSL, a OpenSSL fork, written in C and assembly).

So I am wondering, is performance an important issue? Or is Ursa just for experimentation with new crypto algorithms?
I can easily create a PR with a fix, unless the end goal is Rust-only code with no C/assembly.
I can add this to the next meeting agenda to discuss, unless the answer is already known.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 15 Mar 2019 23:42:37 GMT):<br/>
@danintel Nice!  It would be fantastic if you could talk about this in the next meeting (this coming week).
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Fri, 15 Mar 2019 23:43:59 GMT):<br/>
ok

<p><strong>danielhardman</strong> (Sat, 16 Mar 2019 15:57:06 GMT):<br/>
My vote is that performance *does* matter, and that Ursa is NOT just for experimentation. So I'd love to see a PR.

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Sun, 17 Mar 2019 20:54:45 GMT):<br/>
Performance matters but we shouldn’t just say pick items based on speed. Rusts SHA2 crate is quite fast as well and unless there is a specific reason why someone needs the bleeding edge I don’t want to always say yes. 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Sun, 17 Mar 2019 20:55:46 GMT):<br/>
We can work together to create awesome stuff for ursa 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Sun, 17 Mar 2019 20:57:10 GMT):<br/>
@danintel what libraries were you comparing and where you comparing release mode? I’ve tested raw rust to C code and found if you compare debug mode there is quite a gap of 173x
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Sun, 17 Mar 2019 20:57:32 GMT):<br/>
But if I run it in release mode there isn’t much of a difference 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Sun, 17 Mar 2019 20:57:47 GMT):<br/>
Usually I find rust is just as fast or faster
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 18 Mar 2019 13:24:03 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>nage</strong> (Mon, 18 Mar 2019 15:53:51 GMT):<br/>
Each project should have a proceedure for adding maintainers.  In Indy we let the current code-base maintainers propose a new maintainer, and then I gather feedback from the rest of the maintainers (usually on the indy maintainers call) and if I don't get any "no" votes from the rest of the group we move forward to propose the addition.  We haven't yet had a proposed maintainer move forward with  opposition (a couple have chosen to wait a few weeks and moved forward later), but the next steps would match other groups where we would have more official vote considering commit history and PR review engagement and ability to play well with others.  I'm not sure what Ursa wants to do, but I think it is very healthy to engage everyone who can put in the needed care and time.
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Mon, 18 Mar 2019 15:58:14 GMT):<br/>
@nage with @dhuseby  I believe the project decided that URSA is a do-ocracy. Meaning if you're willing and wanting and have submitted work you're a valid candidate

<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Mon, 18 Mar 2019 16:15:50 GMT):<br/>
No--I'll look at it. I wanted something directly comparable to openssl microbenchmarks.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 18 Mar 2019 16:24:31 GMT):<br/>
I don’t understand the numbers here because ursa/sha256 is using amcl/sha256

<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Mon, 18 Mar 2019 23:32:08 GMT):<br/>
@danintel are those sha512 numbers the full sha512 or one of the truncated sha512's?
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Mon, 18 Mar 2019 23:33:00 GMT):<br/>
It is full sha512.
</p>
<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Mon, 18 Mar 2019 23:35:00 GMT):<br/>
I don't see why a truncated sha512 should be different. The truncated digests have a different IVs and the result is shorter, but the stuff in-between is the same.

@dhuseby and @amundson any update on reviews for @MALodder's PRs?  It would be good to get some more reviewers to help avoid week-long delays.
</p>
<p><strong>nage</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 17:06:52 GMT):<br/>
(and yes, I do volunteer if you need me)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 18:51:12 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure what standard we are holding this code to. Should I be putting a red X on it because of things like commented-out code? (I would 100% do that on sawtooth or grid repos.) The commit history in the PR has merge commits - that's also not allowed in sawtooth or grid because it implies the commits are not well-formed for review. And in matter fo fact, reviewing the wasm one per-commit doesn't seem productive for that reason. (In the other projects, we rebase upon master if we are updating the PR and force-push).
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 18:52:20 GMT):<br/>
I guess this is mostly a question to @MALodder about the desired style of review.
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 18:54:14 GMT):<br/>
I approved them as-is because it's would be ridiculous to come in so late with anything else.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 18:56:53 GMT):<br/>
normally, I prefer smaller reviews but we can't reject PRs because they have merge commits because those commits have sat for a while and other PRs have been merged.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 18:58:52 GMT):<br/>
I'm not seeing the commented out code you  are referring to
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 18:59:56 GMT):<br/>
what would you prefer  @amundson ?
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 19:03:50 GMT):<br/>
the alternative to merge commit is rebase+force-push to the PR branch. the duration of the PR being open doesn't matter. (I agree though, that they shouldn't sit as long as these did, its just a different problem.)
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 19:05:43 GMT):<br/>
the commented-out code is on the wasm one
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 19:12:01 GMT):<br/>
so, for example, the wasm PR needs rebase or merge. in Sawtooth or Grid, we would require it to be rebased to resolve the conflict. either solution technically works to make the PR mergable.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 19:43:26 GMT):<br/>
@cam-parra Ursa team maintainers can add you directly, without a ticket.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 19:44:08 GMT):<br/>
@cam-parra since you're already part of ursa-maintainers, you should be able to review/merge code
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 19:44:08 GMT):<br/>
@cam-parra since you
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 19:45:19 GMT):<br/>
@amundson I could look to see if your repos have the rebase-and-merge option enabled. Personally, I prefer rebased merges b/c I'm allergic to merge commits 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 19:46:15 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder it does look like there are merge conflicts, though: https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/pull/14
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 20:22:02 GMT):<br/>
@rjones we do all the rebasing manually (for Sawtooth and Grid) because part of our review is how well formed the commit messages are, and so we keep that option off within github
</p>
<p><strong>amundson</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 20:22:31 GMT):<br/>
nearly all the merge commits thus end up being caused by github
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 21:42:38 GMT):<br/>
So you prefer for me to do a git fetch and then re-base onto the current branch? Instead of having GitHub do the merge?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 21:43:15 GMT):<br/>
I’m open to any option that works and doesn’t get in the way if that’s what people preferred to do I’m fine with it
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 19 Mar 2019 22:07:56 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder given the merge conflicts, github can't do the merge. If I'm looking at the right PR

If there's any other optimization suggestions for rust let me know.

@danintel FWI. Ursa code has changed so your benchmarks in the repo https://github.com/danintel/ursaspeed don't work with latest Ursa. They work with Ursa commit d7ac9e92d4f76cd2b68c974031e4e894200dc4bf so you need to checkout that commit and then run your benchmark.
On the topic of why Ursa is so slow, there is a *problem with your benchmark from what i can see*. You are omitting steps in your benchmark with some other libs from what i can see. Consider your `sha256_sha2` function in main.rs in your repo, it does `h.input(&data[..byte_len]);` which means accept the input but it missing the step to compute the digest so *the hash is never computed*, you need to call `h.result()` for that. Same for `sha256_ring`, it does `h.update(&data[..byte_len])` but not `h.finish()`. The same problem here, your function accepts input but *does not compute the digest*. Similarly for `sha256_amcl`, you call `h.process_array(&data[..byte_len])` but not `h.hash()` which is needed to compute the digest. I did not check other functions. I would suggest to make these changes and then compare

<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 14:14:04 GMT):<br/>
Ursa API has changed as `digest` and `DigestAlgorithm` are no longer there so the benchmark code will not work

I don't know if hashing all `0`'s has anything to do with the benchmark either

<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 15:11:50 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/ursa?msg=oCAQmynwhMNWWG9Dx) @MALodder Yes, none of them except ursa were hashing. The benchmarks i posted had all libs hashing.

<p><strong>danintel</strong> (Fri, 22 Mar 2019 16:23:33 GMT):<br/>
@lovesh I saw you added a finish (or equivalent step) for each digest. in a PR, which I merged. Thanks!

I would like to try it again with the latest Ursa. But I see the API has completely changed, so I need to reverse engineer it again and discover the new API.

<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Thu, 28 Mar 2019 12:34:18 GMT):<br/>
Hi, I have a question about delegatable credentials. I think Brent asked during the call whether it would be possible to use DIDs instead of public keys, the answer was difficult to prove control of did anonymously. But how about the use of a DID for the issuer of a delegatable credential? They don't need to prove anonymous control of a key if I understand correctly.  Would that be possible, if it would it seems ideal as when verifying presentations, you would be able to resolve DID to keys in usual way.

[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/ursa?msg=Sin5haWCEEADioapC) @wip-abramson The problem with DIDs (delegatable credentials or otherwise) is that they are not cryptographically linked to the credential or public key. But if the DID was somehow generated from public key like first n bytes of public key or the DID was some pre-decided function of secret key, then you can prove the issuance of credential by a DID. The proving mechanism i can think of are generic proving systems like SNARKs or Bulletproofs

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 16:01:47 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 17:09:12 GMT):<br/>
@Dan it would also be awesome if you all could go over the new, modular APIs we are proposing.  We don't want to do anything that catastrophically breaks sawtooth.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 02 Apr 2019 17:10:01 GMT):<br/>
Additionally, explicitly defining what you mean by "private transactions" would also be useful, but it sounds like you're working on that one.

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 03:12:59 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder No worries.  Definitely the lesser known use of that word...
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 03:13:38 GMT):<br/>
@hartm I like the idea, I'm fuzzy about the practical part whether it really is or not
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 03:51:34 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder There isn't a really compelling reason to use isogeny-based crypto right now.  Its main interest is post-quantum cryptography in the event that lattice-based schemes somehow get broken.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 03:51:53 GMT):<br/>
In that sense, it's a great research topic, but maybe not so useful for implementations.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 03:55:04 GMT):<br/>
Some say SSI based crypto is a drop in replacement for ECC with bigger keys. That's not everything but how true is that
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 03 Apr 2019 05:34:36 GMT):<br/>
Personally, I'd rather use lattice-based key exchanges for post-quantum key exchange.  This is probably the opinion of most people in the crypto community.  It will be interesting to see what NIST does going forward.

<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Thu, 04 Apr 2019 10:03:48 GMT):<br/>
I just updated my line on the minutes from yesterday: Jon- has concerns about using OpenSSL (or any stateful crypto back-end):
If we wrap through to OpenSSL for the crypto implementation of SM2, but then to intel built-ins for AES, and some HSM or wallet for ECC, then our overall application will be swimming with loaded states, logins, contexts, sessions...which need to be managed carefully, finalised, destroyed and so on at the right time.  If people have concerns about tainting then I think it's much more important to ensure we keep these various memory spaces clean and isolated rather than worrying about particular crypto implementations at the far end of one particular API call.

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 05 Apr 2019 13:56:49 GMT):<br/>
I think that's a good reason we should turn our attention to zmix. There's a lot of things we could do that would be beneficial, but everything has not only initial cost but long term costs in managing complexity and maintenance. 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 15:49:35 GMT):<br/>
@dan I agree that we should go to zmix, however, there are needs that Indy has for encryption were WebCrypto/pick your crypto library doesn't meet the needs
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 15:49:59 GMT):<br/>
it would be nice to have the APIs defined and then exact implementations can be expanded later

quick report on ffi-support:

Seems easy to implement and do ffi and solves most of the issues I've had in the past. Lots of pluses in that statement.
However, here are some downsides:
1- Documentation is limited
2- Examples are okay but also limited
3- ByteBuffer, rust coder has to use unsafe to extract the pointers and convert to a slice right now. Need to find a better and easier way to use it.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Mon, 08 Apr 2019 22:43:22 GMT):<br/>
we could move forward with the rfc recommending protobufs for complex types. then try out the ffi crate and if that proves worthwhile we could update the RFC to be more prescriptive requiring that crate.

Regarding https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa-rfcs/pull/8, it sounds like we aren't ready to be more prescriptive on e.g. protobufs or the FFI library. I'm fine with that. So the only open I see is correcting the link for the naming conventions.
@amundson and @manu haven't weighed in yet and may have other feedback.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 10 Apr 2019 19:13:45 GMT):<br/>
I want to avoid being overly prescriptive because it depends on the language and use case. Some items are better serialized to flatbuffers or protobuffers and others its preferred to have a pointer handle
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 10 Apr 2019 19:14:13 GMT):<br/>
Like wasm doesn’t support pointers so you have to use serialized structures

Zether does not work for any arbitrary smart contract but only as a cryptocurrency on a ledger with an account model (Ethereum) and even then its not clean. There is a short summary of which also mentions the challenges https://medium.com/coinmonks/notes-on-zether-towards-privacy-in-a-smart-contract-world-6c4333f975d

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 11 Apr 2019 13:06:18 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Mon, 15 Apr 2019 14:43:28 GMT):<br/>
@lovesh nice summary! I think the economic impediments to deploying on ethereum mainnet, aren't necessarily an issue for something like a permissioned sawtooth network.
The anonymity limitation, however is awkward. I'm skeptical about meaningful anonymity in a permissioned/private blockchain anyway though.
That said I do like the confidentiality model (for hiding the account amounts). One thing I'm not comfortable with, though, is the difficulty for a user in knowing their own balance. Specifcally they only know g^b. On the one hand it's good that nothing is transparent on ledger (like if private keys get compromised), on the other brute forcing g^b seems yucky. Does anyone have thoughts on that? 
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 15 Apr 2019 17:34:39 GMT):<br/>
 @Dan Anonymity is challenging in general (even ZCash is not without its issues given its sometimes limited anonymity set).  One thing I've been intermittently working on (without much success, unfortunately) is trying to adapt something like Riposte (https://www.henrycg.com/pubs/oakland15riposte/) to a permissioned blockchain setting.  The general paradigm is almost exactly what we want, but some of the tools used don't scale and the security models with the existing tools aren't good for blockchain (i.e. security only against one malicious server).

@MALodder I'm not sure at this point, but probably a security conference.  It's a little premature though--you'll want an implementation, security proof, and performance results before you submit.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 15 Apr 2019 18:56:02 GMT):<br/>
right, just wanted to know the options and whether you would want it published beforehand but it sounds like that's not the case
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 16 Apr 2019 02:42:04 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder For a conference paper on something like this, you'd probably want an implementation (for performance purposes), but it would not necessarily need to be a production-ready implementation.  I'd imagine you could move from "test implementation" to "production implementation" during the time that the paper was in the review process.

Anyone have any objections to releasing ursa 0.1.1?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 16 Apr 2019 17:18:17 GMT):<br/>
I submitted a PR mostly minor things related to namespacing the errors for indy
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 16 Apr 2019 17:18:42 GMT):<br/>
with the release of ursa 0.1.1, Indy can now use it
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 16 Apr 2019 17:19:05 GMT):<br/>
pipeline for 0.1.1 results are [here](https://gitlab.sovrin.org/sovrin-foundation/ursa/pipelines/7)

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 16 Apr 2019 18:09:33 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder No, but do we need to follow any particular release protocols?  Did we have anything in place for minor "hundredth" releases?
</p>

Hi,  I can't edit the agenda. Wondering if someone can add the following to the agenda or minutes as appropriate: "Discussed foreign function interface for lib-ursa, and interface to Fabric through golang. We have agreement at this stage to try different alternatives and learn which is best for our needs. Mike, Maryam, DH  and DB to pursue next steps" 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 17 Apr 2019 15:17:58 GMT):<br/>

@hartm I can help you write the aggregated/multi/threshold signatures API. We can use what I learned from this project [here](https://github.com/mikelodder7/bls12-381-comparison/blob/master/src/main.rs)
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 17 Apr 2019 20:40:57 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder That looks like a pretty nice interface.  We'll want to modify it so that we can use different schemes, obviously, but it's a good start.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 17 Apr 2019 20:42:00 GMT):<br/>
I'll write up a formal interface sometime over the next couple of days and then you can tell me how I got the Rust stuff wrong ;)

<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Fri, 19 Apr 2019 19:32:41 GMT):<br/>
Hey @MALodder  @dhuseby I believe the python wrapper is ready to move to hyperledger. I would need your assistance to do so

<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Fri, 19 Apr 2019 19:37:25 GMT):<br/>
I am working out the problems with gitlab but it should at least be tested by next week
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 19 Apr 2019 20:05:11 GMT):<br/>
Do we want to have separate repos for the language bindings?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 19 Apr 2019 20:05:44 GMT):<br/>
If we go with generated bindings using protobufs we will want only one set of the protobuf files. 
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 19 Apr 2019 20:06:42 GMT):<br/>
Maybe we have a repo just for the protobuf files? Then libursa can pull it in as a submodule. The python-Ursa repo can do the same. 
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 19 Apr 2019 20:07:24 GMT):<br/>
@cam-parra does the python-ursa project pull in and build libursa?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 19 Apr 2019 20:07:57 GMT):<br/>
If it does then we can keep the protobuf files in libursa and not have a separate repo for them. 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 19 Apr 2019 20:18:58 GMT):<br/>
The RFC I submitted is for the bindings to be in ursa and the language idiomatic libraries are in separate repos

@rjones Does that DCO check look for merges? Most merges or PRs accepted don't include (or require) a DCO
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 21 Apr 2019 21:04:35 GMT):<br/>
@cam-parra it does not. Feel free to grab it and try it yourself https://gist.github.com/ryjones/07ac650dcc5e83c91e8308ec98bacda4 you can also do a "git log (hash)" to see the exact commit
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Mon, 22 Apr 2019 00:41:04 GMT):<br/>
depending on what your workflow is like you can reduce the amount of merges by rebasing as you go.  irrespective of DCO checking sometimes that makes for a cleaner history that makes it easier for reviewers too.

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 23 Apr 2019 19:43:25 GMT):<br/>
@Dan We discussed the following
```
Authz Overview and Review
Authz New architecture
Pointcheval Saunders Threshold Signature
```
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 23 Apr 2019 19:44:56 GMT):<br/>
anyone have a high level diff of idemix vs. anoncreds2.0?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 23 Apr 2019 19:45:26 GMT):<br/>
@Dan I can give you some of that, I don't know where Idemix is at this point but I can tell you where we started from
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 23 Apr 2019 19:46:40 GMT):<br/>
This is the Idemix reference implementation we used
https://domino.research.ibm.com/library/cyberdig.nsf/1e4115aea78b6e7c85256b360066f0d4/eeb54ff3b91c1d648525759b004fbbb1?OpenDocument
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 23 Apr 2019 19:49:19 GMT):<br/>
Anoncreds 2.0 is vastly different in the following ways:

1- We are using BBS+ and Poincheval Saunders signatures which are ECC pairing based
2- We use Bulletproofs for range proofs, set memberships, and inequality proofs
3- We can use zkSNARKS instead of Bulletproofs
4- We also are planning to allow some credentials to be transferrable and delegatable
5- We have policies which allow Agents to prove authorizations for the credentials they hold allowing owners to halt bad agents when necessary
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 23 Apr 2019 19:49:44 GMT):<br/>
We plan to not use any RSA crypto for Anoncreds 2.0
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 23 Apr 2019 19:58:18 GMT):<br/>
cool. that helps a lot thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>deepikav</strong> (Tue, 23 Apr 2019 20:39:41 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder, what would BBS+ and Poincheval Saunders Signatures be replacing in idemix?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 23 Apr 2019 20:44:10 GMT):<br/>
BBS+ and pointcheval saunders are used for the anonymous credentials portion
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 23 Apr 2019 20:44:40 GMT):<br/>
Indy doesn't use Idemix directly, it uses only a subset of it and does revocation completely different

I'm coding both right now and want to do benchmarks

So I'm about to start hitting the Overleaf document.  A lot of the detail of what I need to write up concerns the nature of sessions and initialisation and key handling and stuff in the library as a whole, not just the simple crypto calls.  Unless someone screams otherwise I'll add a whole major section to the Overleaf doc on provider architecture
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 01 May 2019 15:21:54 GMT):<br/>
@JonGeater Go for it.  Add a whole new file even if you like.
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Wed, 01 May 2019 15:22:56 GMT):<br/>

I think we might be missing the commit history for a lot of ursa. Like from the point of time that things got migrated over from the lab state. For example if I want to figure out the rational for why these files are in bin, I get a dead end
https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/commit/3367813213dd532d24ec9f5e92af71842c377080#diff-9ca2f7ab5fffa18f89b226c4a583fc91
If I want to know anything about the BLS code I get the same dead end.

maybe a problem with the github interface? Just pick probably anything that had been in libhl-crypto as part of the lab (and probably previously as part of indy-crypto). When it came over into ursa and refactored as libursa I think we lost the commit history - or at least that's what I dead end on through github.

I think gitk makes it easier to see that, but a git rename usually looks like a delete and an add.

<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 13:23:19 GMT):<br/>
For today's meeting some people may have noticed I've put a bunch of very drafty information into the Overleaf doc to do with key IDs, session handling, context reference etc.  What I *haven't* done yet is the key/TEE attestation details.  This is because I want people to be happy with the provider/session type architecture before I go ahead with the hard detail (which would change hugely if we reject what I've done so far)
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 13:55:20 GMT):<br/>
new to overleaf... it looks like there's supposed to be a rendered view but it's filled with errors. I would guess since this is an online thing that's not a local problem?

Regarding collaborative LaTeX workflows.. Looks like there's Confluence plugins. That would be a consistent approach with not using google docs and not introducing another un-integrated tool like overleaf.
From experience working on a lot of RFCs, the initial weeks (months?) with a doc, a git workflow is not super productive. Git workflow is definitely required once the thing has taken shape.
TeX-ish people might like to look at these links and if they look promising we can see about HL supporting one in our Wiki.

The current document in question is kind of straddling definitions. I think it is meant as documentation of APIs but that kind of thing could also be written in markdown as an RFC proposing the interface styles and rationale.
In general I don't think we want latex in RFCs. We might want more sophisticated formatting for documentation.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 20:27:30 GMT):<br/>
Mostly we need latex for the crypto math. I don’t think we’ll use it much for RFCs except in that area

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 20:40:27 GMT):<br/>
The confluence plugins look shaky at best, unfortunately, and I doubt they'll work with large documents that contain multiple files.  Now I am extremely tempted to try to paste an entire paper in chat....
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 15 May 2019 20:42:03 GMT):<br/>
I think github is probably fine as-is though.  The only issue is that if people want to make changes, they'll need to have a Tex compiler installed.  However, I think that the set of people we want making changes to math stuff is probably contained in the set people who have Tex compilers installed, so I'm not sure this is a big issue.

@MALodder I guess @dhuseby is tied up. If you are eager to merge, I'm fine either way with the lock file. I mostly wanted to document why. The more "why's" that are searchable the fewer questions down the road / less bike shedding.

I'm coming up to speed on milagro, and I see that it has a bls module in the bn254 module. Ursa has it's own bls module that relies on amcl::bn254. Curious why the separate ursa implementation vs using amcl's? 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 18:41:59 GMT):<br/>
bls is the curve
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 18:42:06 GMT):<br/>
bn254 is also the curve
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 18:44:01 GMT):<br/>
milagro also does not implement the signature aggregation feature
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 18:45:49 GMT):<br/>
so the curve is Boneh-Lynn-Scott and the signature is Boneh-Lynn-Shacham
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 18:46:10 GMT):<br/>
you can build the BLS signature using any pairing friendly curve
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 18:46:58 GMT):<br/>
I want to make it so in rust you can say BLS::new::<bls381>() or BLS::new::<bn254>() and the rest of the functions just work

</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 16 May 2019 21:11:29 GMT):<br/>
It looks like the decision for implementing the bls signature (not the curve) came like two years ago by @ vimmerru. I see that the ursa implementation has serialization helper functions and the aggregation method which are lacking in milagro. But it also seemed like one could just extend the milagro code to do the same. So I was wondering if there was some other design goal?
Particularly one that should be preserved as I start to mess with stuff?

Regarding the bls curve, I looked briefly at your bls-signature comparison project and it looks like you imported milagro with the bls curve as a parameter maybe? I'm a little confused on the apache namespace, if that's the same as the amcl namespace. Ursa with me as I'm still pretty new with rust.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 03:32:54 GMT):<br/>
For one thing Milagro uses the base generator for its signatures. This is not a bad thing but Indy generates a random one and uses that for the keys. We also plan to add aggregated signatures in addition to the multisig as well
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 05:20:16 GMT):<br/>
Milagro added BLS signature scheme only a few months back so the rust files you see like bls, bls192 are BLS signature scheme imlemenatation and not the curve.  Regarding curves, Milagro defines curve parameters in `roms` directory so for BLS12-381 constants you can look at rom_bls381_64.rs and then the logic is kept generic so ecp.rs, ecp2.rs will be groups G1 and G2 for BLS curve, BN curves, etc. 
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 05:22:29 GMT):<br/>
My understanding is that we already have aggregated signatures, we just call them multisig
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 05:26:30 GMT):<br/>
Secondly we should do away with the Generator code we have in indy-crypto/ursa. Milagro gives you generator for both groups and if you need additional generators you can hash strings on the curve using the `mapit` function
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 05:28:22 GMT):<br/>
Aggregated is not the same as Multisig
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 05:29:00 GMT):<br/>
multisig is an aggregated signature, but aggregated means you have a different message and signature that can be accumulated into a single value
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 05:29:12 GMT):<br/>
multisig, is the same message was signed for all signatures
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 05:29:20 GMT):<br/>
I'm okay removing the generator
</p>

My project [here](https://github.com/mikelodder7/bls12-381-comparison/blob/master/src/main.rs) show the difference. Its subtle for sure. The message is the same for all signatures or each signature is associated with a different message.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 13:29:53 GMT):<br/>
Cool discussion. 
AMCL seems like a really compact library (I see that's their main design objective). In the future I could see us wanting an optimal library as well. Mostly for validators that will be doing a lot of these options, vs clients that probably are best off using amcl. @danintel I know intel has BN curves implementations that likely use IPP acceleration. Not sure if any of the acceleration is open source though. Something we could put on the backlog.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 13:54:34 GMT):<br/>
Also, btw, not shocking that it was hard to see when bls signing was introduced in amcl with this kind of commit history: https://github.com/apache/incubator-milagro-crypto/commits/master/version3/rust

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:09:09 GMT):<br/>
@amundson you left a comment on https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa-rfcs/pull/8 last month. @MALodder asked for clarification in that thread.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:13:36 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder I think we are good to go on the CI PR if you want to update the Cargo.lock commit message with the rationale.. something about providing traceability between commits, builds, and the dependencies used in the builds. I gather from the comments that was @dhuseby 's goal. https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/pull/27/commits/4798c59731134f9a425e9b8bb1d7488ecde0e714
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:14:20 GMT):<br/>
Sounds good. Can you approve the PR? I'll fill out that info in the PR message then merge
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:16:33 GMT):<br/>
I updated my comments
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:16:58 GMT):<br/>
Until you approve it @Dan the merge is blocked
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:19:38 GMT):<br/>
I was thinking to put it in the commit message for the Cargo.lock commit. That way when the next new guy on the project wonders why it's there she just has to look at the history for the file and sees the rationale.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:21:32 GMT):<br/>
you need me to do a rebase to amend the message or is there another method you are suggesting?

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:21:40 GMT):<br/>
@Dan ^^
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:21:45 GMT):<br/>
yes that's what I was thinking
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:21:50 GMT):<br/>
rebase?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:22:00 GMT):<br/>
yes rebase and amend the message
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 14:27:57 GMT):<br/>
okay here's the new commit message

*The idea of checking in the cargo.lock file is for reproducible/deterministic builds. We want to track the contents of that over time so that we know exactly what dependencies were used to support specific builds of Ursa.*

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 16:54:10 GMT):<br/>
Rust question ... if a family of structs with one or more common fields have the same method(s) on those fields is there an inheritance-ish feature to avoid reimplementing the method for each struct?
I thought a default trait method implementation would be nice but traits can't use struct fields. (I see there's a postponed RFC to give traits access to fields.) 
Trait bounds and associated types facilitate generics behaviors but don't appear to facilitate anything with default methods operating on fields. 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 17:07:50 GMT):<br/>
Traits can define `type`s which can use fields
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 17:14:26 GMT):<br/>
So if each struct had a name field, then I could define a trait with some sort of Name Type such that I could write a default implementation that did something like `println!(self::name);` ?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 17:20:48 GMT):<br/>
it would be something like `self::Type1::name`
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 17:22:28 GMT):<br/>
thx
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:03:03 GMT):<br/>
would that field still be accessible from each struct?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:03:18 GMT):<br/>
I'm trying to figure out what you're asking
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:03:54 GMT):<br/>
generic traits?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:05:01 GMT):<br/>
Ok, concrete example...
Each struct has a bytes field.
We have several as_bytes() methods that just do `self.bytes.as_slice()`
Seems like it would be nice to inherit that method rather than re-implement it inside each struct that has a bytes field.

One sec
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:09:36 GMT):<br/>
@Dan what you should always ask yourself first is: is there a standard way of doing this seemingly common thing?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:09:45 GMT):<br/>
the answer is usually yes
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:09:53 GMT):<br/>
that is literally the question that I asked :D
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:10:30 GMT):<br/>
ok
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:10:35 GMT):<br/>
so for your as_slice thing
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:10:49 GMT):<br/>
What you really want to do is implement the AsRef trait
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:10:55 GMT):<br/>
https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/convert/trait.AsRef.html
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:11:13 GMT):<br/>
an example of implementing that is here: https://docs.rs/sodiumoxide/0.2.2/sodiumoxide/crypto/hash/sha256/struct.Digest.html
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:11:43 GMT):<br/>
do your structs have members other than the bytes?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:12:17 GMT):<br/>
if they only have bytes, then you should make it a "virtual type" for a slice or Vec depending on if it is dynamically sized or not
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:12:50 GMT):<br/>
for instance, a Digest is just a fixed length slice
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:12:56 GMT):<br/>
so it is declared like this:
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:12:59 GMT):<br/>
pub struct Digest(pub [u8; 32]);
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:13:32 GMT):<br/>
which is just making a type "alias" called Digest but is really just a [u8; 32]
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:13:45 GMT):<br/>
did I answer your question?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:14:19 GMT):<br/>
Those aren't called "virtual types". they have a name but i can't remember what it is
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:15:14 GMT):<br/>
Thanks I'll study those links.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:20:37 GMT):<br/>
so, as_slice and as_bytes are also found in the standard library.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:20:45 GMT):<br/>
for instance String::as_bytes()
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:20:55 GMT):<br/>
and Vec<T>::as_slice)(
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:21:11 GMT):<br/>
but those are only implemented on standard types where it makes sense
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:21:41 GMT):<br/>
the official "standard" way is to implement AsRef<T> for the converted type T
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:22:33 GMT):<br/>
so instead of as_bytes do AsRef<[u8]>
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:22:45 GMT):<br/>
In this case the bytes field seems to be a sort of default serialization of the struct and the as_bytes method just returns those bytes as a slice. 
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:23:24 GMT):<br/>
oh
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:23:33 GMT):<br/>
serialization is a whole other can of worms
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:23:47 GMT):<br/>
I hate to throw this at you but https://serde.rs
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:24:13 GMT):<br/>
it's the "standard" way to make types SERializable/DEserializable
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:24:17 GMT):<br/>
Yeah serde is also on my read list :)
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:24:30 GMT):<br/>
if you follow that standard then you can serde into and out of a whole bunch of different formats
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:24:32 GMT):<br/>
especially since these structs are already deriving Serialize
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:24:38 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:24:58 GMT):<br/>
most of the time you should be able to use the serde macros to autogenerate the serde glue
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:25:19 GMT):<br/>
just decorate the struct and members with the correct macro declarations and everything gets generated
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:29:32 GMT):<br/>
If you could suggest one project with really well done rust (to look at for examples of "the right way") what would that be?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:29:48 GMT):<br/>
right way to do what?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:29:56 GMT):<br/>
as much as possible ;)

there is one trick not in there that I learned a few months ago that i absolutely love to use when working with the aliased array types (e.g. Digest, Nonce, etc)
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 18:31:49 GMT):<br/>
use destructuring when you need to manipulate the bytes in an instance of those types
</p>

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 17 May 2019 19:45:08 GMT):<br/>
Destructuring is nice. Most of the time @Dan if I need to do what you’re asking I use traits with types or macros. Both of those usually get the job done

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 14:02:39 GMT):<br/>
fine by me if we keep a small list of supported OS's. I don't know how many people are running 32 bit anything? (also I don't know a lot of people)
</p>

personally I moved to 33 bits years ago.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 14:03:10 GMT):<br/>
I vote to not support it, here's why

1- Anyone using Windows these days is typically using 64-bit
2- Ursa can compile to 32-bit arm both iOS and Android. I just tried it
3- Ursa can compile to 32-bit on linux
4- Unless someone has a compelling reason for 32 bit windows, I'm going to remove it from the settings file
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 14:06:13 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 17:56:14 GMT):<br/>
luckily - no name squatters. I think we should probably have a different version numbering scheme - can that be set in the .yml? I'd rather not have them start at 1.0 for obvious reasons :)
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 18:11:30 GMT):<br/>
Is this the obvious reason?

`Compiling ursa v0.1.1 (/Users/jag/Projects/ursa/libursa)`
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 18:11:35 GMT):<br/>
;-)
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 18:15:23 GMT):<br/>
Question: why do we have both 'libursa/tests/{lorem}.rs' and also a collection of 'libursa/bin/test_{ipsum}.rs'?
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 18:15:52 GMT):<br/>
This seems morally wrong
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 18:19:12 GMT):<br/>
@JonGeater also: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/hyperledger/ursa/history is version 1.0.1 which might annoy the TSC :)
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 18:25:01 GMT):<br/>
Shouldn't that PR be called "Don't build 32-bit Windows"?  Otherwise it seems like it's a Win64 exclusive

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 23:51:52 GMT):<br/>
what do we think about getting rid of this configuration in the repo and instead making good use of the "Rebase and merge" button.

</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 23:52:11 GMT):<br/>
I prefer that to littering the history with merge commits
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 23:53:11 GMT):<br/>
I can make it so rebase and merge is the available option
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 23:55:32 GMT):<br/>
that would be kewl 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 23:57:05 GMT):<br/>
I think you need a HIPE and a vote of the TSC though
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 22 May 2019 23:59:57 GMT):<br/>
well of course, but only after the governing board issues a non-binding resolution in favor of this approach
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 00:08:47 GMT):<br/>
done. I hope that's totally uncontroversial
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 00:11:54 GMT):<br/>
I still see the "this branch is out of date" thing - it won't let me click the `rebase and merge` button.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 00:19:50 GMT):<br/>
link me a pr

</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 02:10:53 GMT):<br/>
oh, you merged master into that branch? I was trying to figure out if there was a way to avoid that. 
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 02:12:23 GMT):<br/>
oh. I clicked the "rebase" button
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 02:12:57 GMT):<br/>
I didn't click `merge`
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 02:13:38 GMT):<br/>
do you have a `revert` button? I do
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 02:14:16 GMT):<br/>
if you had clicked `rebase and merge` you would have had the same result, I suspect
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 02:14:51 GMT):<br/>
hmm...
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 02:16:33 GMT):<br/>
that's weird... the commit history for the PR shows a merge and I had seen this message in the comments view of the PR which is why I thought you had merged.

</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 02:18:41 GMT):<br/>
I only clicked the "rebase" button
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 02:24:46 GMT):<br/>
I think It's a clean rebase.

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 13:19:33 GMT):<br/>
yeah it certainly seems to be a clean rebase. must just be something weird about the github interface and/or how it's managing the rebase under the hood.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 13:36:57 GMT):<br/>

I just hope it doesn't get as bad as gerrit.

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 15:14:55 GMT):<br/>
specifically libursa.so, libursa.dylib, libursa.dll

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 15:15:14 GMT):<br/>
deb, rpm, msi files
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 23 May 2019 15:58:33 GMT):<br/>
in sawtooth we only officially produce debs and those go into an ubunto repo (i.e. apt not a git repo)
Not sure what to do in this case given there's so many artifacts. Maybe a good question to float in the CI/CD committee? I think they meet tomorrow morning.

Microsoft Research paper just released of a zkSNARK without a trusted setup
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 10:57:46 GMT):<br/>
From Figure 1 in paper, the proving time seems worse than Bulletproofs (n.logn vs n) in some cases or same at best. You can trade-off proof size with verification time. I haven't looked at Dmitry improvement paper in detail but i think it offers a similar tradeoff (originally described in an older paper from Bootle to build ZK proof for arithematic circuits). The above paper generalizes the tradeoff whereas Dmitry's paper uses a square root tradeoff (It probably can be generalized too). So its not exciting in terms of the results. Maybe something can be learned from the techniques.

Is there a generalization across these for avoiding the CRS?
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Fri, 24 May 2019 21:06:17 GMT):<br/>
@lovesh Could you explain why you'd want to do a proof-size and verification time trade off?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Sat, 25 May 2019 14:22:15 GMT):<br/>
in a blockchain you generally want to minimize what you have to send and verify, but there's a lot of other applications that have nothing to do with blockchains. Even with a blockchain you might have small clients and want to minimize the prover cost.
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Sat, 25 May 2019 21:07:18 GMT):<br/>
@cam-parra If you want to persist the proof for long periods of time, you want to minimize the proof size

Hi everyone, I'm interested in familiarizing myself with the Ursa codebase. At the moment, I have a couple of questions: 

1. I noticed that there seem to be two major parts to `libursa` -- `BLS` and `CL`. What do these stand for?
2. Does the `libursa` C API currently provide functions for ed25519 signing? 

Thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>brentzundel</strong> (Sun, 26 May 2019 12:17:23 GMT):<br/>
[ ](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/ursa?msg=AwucufHXFLL8j9Whd) @alexmatson I believe I can answer the first question. `BLS` is the Boneh-Lynn-Shachem signature. `CL` is the Camenisch-Lysyanskaya signature. 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 27 May 2019 15:54:28 GMT):<br/>
The answer to #2 is yes
</p>
<p><strong>alexmatson</strong> (Mon, 27 May 2019 19:39:22 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder I can't seem to find them. I see FFI bindings for BLS and CL, but not for ed25519. Am I looking in the right place? (`libursa/src/ffi/`).
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 00:05:49 GMT):<br/>
@alexmatson Sorry I misunderstood, no we don't have FFI for ed25519. But you can use libsodium for that
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 00:05:56 GMT):<br/>
what's your use case

From the call this morning, I'll reiterate here, if there is any feature or platform artifact that teams or individuals need from ursa, unless we know about we will move forward with the needs we do know about
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 15:20:15 GMT):<br/>
As request on the ursa call this morning, here is the initial document on ZKLang https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CLdkd70Mfa-AhnrqwTMVwBdF-HdvVNBiOKcq13lPstY/edit?usp=sharing
</p>
<p><strong>alexmatson</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 15:21:01 GMT):<br/>
I was recently accepted into Hyperledger's internship program. My upcoming project is to integrate Ursa's crypto into HL Iroha, and at the moment I'm just trying to get a feel for what the details of that integration are going to look like. Iroha is a C++ codebase and mainly uses ed25519 with SHA-3 (I know the SHA-3 part is also going to be a separate challenge here) as their signature scheme.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 15:22:53 GMT):<br/>
Okay, I see, Well we can work on this. This is a pretty easy feature request
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 15:24:16 GMT):<br/>
what's the motive to use SHA3 over SHA2 for the signature
</p>
<p><strong>alexmatson</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 15:35:23 GMT):<br/>
My mentor told me they chose SHA-3 because it is the latest standard, and it would be easier to start with SHA-3 than migrate it to later if they started with SHA-2. He also said it is more resistant to birthday attacks. 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 15:35:40 GMT):<br/>
it is but its slower
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 15:48:37 GMT):<br/>
So ursa currently uses the dalek library to do Ed25519
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 15:49:08 GMT):<br/>
you can use SHA3 to hash the message then use SHA2 to compute the signature
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 15:49:27 GMT):<br/>
But there isn't a library right now that uses any 512-bit hash to compute ed25519
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 15:49:36 GMT):<br/>
you would have to write that by hand
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 15:49:49 GMT):<br/>
libsodium uses Sha2 as does Dalek
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 15:51:54 GMT):<br/>
So you should ask if that is still okay
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 15:54:18 GMT):<br/>
Does the fabric project have any plans for adopting URSA? 
</p>
<p><strong>alexmatson</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 15:58:46 GMT):<br/>
Currently, our tentative plan is to modify dalek and make the choice of hash configurable between SHA2/SHA3 (similar to this previous PR submitted to the library https://github.com/dalek-cryptography/ed25519-dalek/pull/73). Then raise an issue/PR and try to convince the maintainers that this is beneficial enough to merge it upstream. 

</p>
<p><strong>alexmatson</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 15:59:08 GMT):<br/>
Admittedly, I'm somewhat of a beginner to cryptography so I think I need to do some research into your suggestion of computing the signature with SHA-2 but having the message hashed with SHA-3. Do you think this would provide the same results as using SHA-3 directly in the signing functions? 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 15:59:33 GMT):<br/>
most of the crypto community that I'm aware of are refusing to adopt sha3 for now because its significantly slower
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 15:59:55 GMT):<br/>
No it would not
</p>
<p><strong>alexmatson</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 16:02:45 GMT):<br/>
Hm, I see. Thank you for taking the time to help me, I appreciate it. I'll talk to my mentor more about different options. The problem I see at the moment is I think Iroha is already using SHA-3, so modifying the signature scheme might break existing use cases. 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 16:04:20 GMT):<br/>
They’re using ed25519 with sha3 can you point me to their source code?
</p>
<p><strong>alexmatson</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 16:06:03 GMT):<br/>
https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/tree/master/shared_model/cryptography/ed25519_sha3_impl
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 19:16:10 GMT):<br/>
oh man, it looks to me like the eddsa isn't even implemented correctly
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 19:28:09 GMT):<br/>
they are using Sha3_256 to hash the message then computing the signature on that
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 19:28:17 GMT):<br/>
its not true ed25519
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 19:28:19 GMT):<br/>
with sha3
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 19:29:43 GMT):<br/>
if that's what iroha needs the ursa can do that without needing to modify the dalek libraries
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 19:33:50 GMT):<br/>
what do you mean it's not true ed25519 with sha3?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 19:36:17 GMT):<br/>
EdDSA says to compute a 512-bit hash from the nonce and the message to compute the scalar *r*, compute the point *R* by multiplying the base point by *r*. Then compute the 512-bit hash k that includes R, the public key and the message. Then multiply the private key by *k* and add it to *r* to arrive at *s*. The signature is R, s
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 19:36:42 GMT):<br/>
True Ed25519 would use sha3 for all computations of the 512 bit hash. 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 19:37:04 GMT):<br/>
Iroha is just computing the Sha3_256 hash of the message then passing that to the signing algorithm
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 19:37:18 GMT):<br/>
The signing algorithm is using Sha2_512
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 19:37:36 GMT):<br/>
oh that's weird
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 19:37:40 GMT):<br/>
right
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 19:38:22 GMT):<br/>
Most crypto engineers I talk to aren't using sha3 because 
1- Sha2 is still has adequate security
2- Sha3 is much slower than Sha2
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 19:38:39 GMT):<br/>
So I don't know why they didn't just use the default
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 19:39:16 GMT):<br/>
It would be wise for iroha to add a domain separation string since they are hashing the message first
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 19:39:20 GMT):<br/>
if you still have it handy where's the point that they use sha2_512?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 19:39:59 GMT):<br/>
They are calling an external library ed25519
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 19:40:28 GMT):<br/>
I don't which implementation they are pulling because I can't find it in any of there build scripts
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 19:40:54 GMT):<br/>
I'm making an assumption that that library is correctly implementing the signature, which uses Sha2_512
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 19:41:22 GMT):<br/>
ok. this would all be easier if there was a single hyperledger project that consistently implemented crypto functions
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 May 2019 19:41:38 GMT):<br/>
right

@MALodder I did some digging, and I think that external library they're using is their own implementation, which uses SHA3_512 within the signature as well: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-ed25519/
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 15:54:58 GMT):<br/>
yep that does look like it
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 16:29:21 GMT):<br/>
Still its not advisable to implement custom signatures solely that Sha3 is newer than Sha2
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 30 May 2019 16:31:05 GMT):<br/>
[Here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-mls-protocol/?include_text=1) is the latest draft for MLS that @kdenhartog wants feedback on
</p>

Thank you @MALodder I still wasn't able to get around to that yet.

A lot of methods in indy-crypto's as well as Ursa's FFI for anoncreds functions *return success even if there is an error*. This should not be the case. Or am i missing something? Have a look at this commit where i have fixed them in Ursa https://github.com/lovesh/ursa/commit/f8e04193e82bbe6737b1b2962ec7d019aeca0aa5.

</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 19:44:37 GMT):<br/>
If it works, then Iroha can use Ursa
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 19:44:55 GMT):<br/>
I say if because I don't know how Iroha will use the APIs so this was a initial stab
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:43:42 GMT):<br/>
Does indy actively use the CL based anon creds?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:46:16 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder looks like travis failed. maybe on cargo fmt.

Right I got an email back from the ffi-support crate authors saying what I'm doing for inputs is not considered safe
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:47:16 GMT):<br/>
so I need to rework it
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:47:21 GMT):<br/>
I CC'd you on that email
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:47:26 GMT):<br/>
let me know if you didn't get it
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:47:34 GMT):<br/>
it's in the recent pile ;)
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:48:11 GMT):<br/>
just wanted you to know that travis barfed in case you were waiting on it.

<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:48:40 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder I have a github account again! Could we remove the user cam-parra from ursa maintainers and add mac-arrap ? 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:48:49 GMT):<br/>
sure
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:50:07 GMT):<br/>
I can do visual confirmation if needed 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:53:24 GMT):<br/>
anyone remember the link to find the ursa maintainers list
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:54:22 GMT):<br/>
is this it? https://github.com/orgs/hyperledger/teams/ursa-maintainers/members
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:54:53 GMT):<br/>
I believe that's what @rjones gave us
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:56:07 GMT):<br/>
Could @mac-arrap also be added to the hyperledger organization? 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:57:36 GMT):<br/>
Cam, it says you aren't a member of hyperledger yet
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:57:46 GMT):<br/>
so when you are then I can add you back in
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:59:14 GMT):<br/>
No worries I think that @rjones or @dhuseby can add me 
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 20:59:43 GMT):<br/>
@cam-parra do you have 2FA setup?

<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 21:02:31 GMT):<br/>
I lost access to that account due to losing codes to 2FA (were on on my EV machine)  so I had them remove my email from that account and I made a new one 
</p>

I updated PR 33. It has a safer method for FFI for now
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 22:01:21 GMT):<br/>
once ffi-support crate adds FfiSlice or something like it we can switch to that
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 22:01:33 GMT):<br/>
but that interface should be enough for Iroha to use ursa 
</p>
<p><strong>alexmatson</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 22:06:00 GMT):<br/>
Wow, thanks @MALodder! Those bindings should work well :) 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 22:07:20 GMT):<br/>
I believe Ursa is now the only project to expose the Dalek libraries over FFI
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 06 Jun 2019 22:08:03 GMT):<br/>
I might try a little later tonight to see if I can eliminate Pointers and size values

@danintel discussion in the sovrin crypto call today about finding an optimized bls12-381. We currently rely on Milagro's AMCL library which is designed to be portable. There's no asm, for example. Is that research something you'd like to do?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 18 Jun 2019 15:01:22 GMT):<br/>
some subsequent discussion... zcash is the other known place for this code. it's currently slower but it's thought that optimization is in process there. I don't know whether they are interested in upstream commits, but that's another option. More expensive of course, than finding another implementation.

<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Sun, 23 Jun 2019 18:33:20 GMT):<br/>
That's essentially a mid-level paranoia use case for HSMs or Secure Elements - at a certain point shared DRAM is ALWAYS vulnerable and a dedicated compute unit with the keys offloaded from the main application is your only option.  The system protections get better all the time, making these attacks quite fanciful for a while, until the attacks get better again (usually around August every year ;-) ) then you're screwed again for a while.

Notes from today's meeting

Ursa Meeting Notes
==================
Discussed PRs:
    - Lovesh Bulletpoof
        - Add more tests and code documentation
    - Anoncreds 1.0
        - Belongs in ursa-docs repo

Dfinity has interest in ZMix with BBS+ signatures
Unbound agreed to help with PKCS11 interface when the RFC is created and keep their tech as an implementation outside of Ursa
    - Unbound will reach to ursa group and Jon Geater
Manu Drijvers said there is no licensing restrictions around https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/514.pdf
    - Algorand probably making implementation in Rust
Manu Drijvers to see if he can get his paper about threshold PS signatures on eprint.
ZKLang spec to be done in Latex in ursa-docs.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 26 Jun 2019 17:02:49 GMT):<br/>
There seems to be a growing interest in the PKCS11 interface. I would propose we work on this as an RFC and have @Dan and @JonGeater lead it. I'm not the most familiar PKCS11 so I'm not the most qualified to lead it. I believe @Dan with intel's work on SGX and @JonGeater are the most qualified to lead that effort. I want to participate from an implementation and usability side of things.

Sorry to nominate @Dan and @JonGeater in there absence

are you talking about when we verify signatures in Indy?

<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 14:42:44 GMT):<br/>
Yes, BLS sigs.
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 14:43:36 GMT):<br/>
But apart from a general good practice, don't know if that makes sense in case of sig verification. Thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 14:44:35 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure. I think because we are just checking if the signature is valid, we might be okay. However, could an attacker use a point at infinity to validate any signature?
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 14:47:12 GMT):<br/>
probably not point at infinity but if the sig lies in a small subgroup, could the private key be recovered?

@hart ^^^
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 14:47:18 GMT):<br/>
@hartm  ^^^
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 14:48:35 GMT):<br/>
Elliptic curve groups used for cryptography pretty much always have prime order.  This means they don't have subgroups.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 14:49:30 GMT):<br/>
My point with Lovesh was that the point at infinity is often a cause of errors and vulnerabilities in crypto code and should be tested as an input to everything.
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 14:52:51 GMT):<br/>
Does this statement apply to curves with cofactors?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 14:54:48 GMT):<br/>
No.  Curves with cofactors that aren't equal to one aren't prime order.  However, we work over a prime order subgroup of these curves.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 14:55:18 GMT):<br/>
Sorry for generalizing too much there.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 14:55:59 GMT):<br/>
But you should always be working in a large prime order (sub-) group when using elliptic curves.
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 14:58:55 GMT):<br/>
Ok. For curves with cofactor not equal to one like BLS381 or BN254, an attacker can construct a point satisfying curve equation but of small order. The question is if we ignore key exchange protocols, what are the attacks possible?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 15:01:17 GMT):<br/>
The point is the actual "group" used for crypto is not the whole elliptic curve, but a subgroup of the group defined by the elliptic curve.  The subgroup--or actual group where crypto is done--has large prime order, so DLOG/CDH/DDH are still hard.  An attacker can solve these problems over the small order part of the group, but they aren't useful for breaking the cryptography, because the small order part of the bigger group is nonexistent in the subgroup.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 15:01:20 GMT):<br/>
Does that make sense?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 15:02:06 GMT):<br/>
To me it does
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 15:02:26 GMT):<br/>
I would recommend keeping a copy of https://www.amazon.com/Algebra-2nd-Michael-Artin/dp/0132413779 around the office for stuff like this.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 15:02:33 GMT):<br/>
I guess the call has started.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 15:04:11 GMT):<br/>
We should add the checks to the BLS code but it doesn't  sound urgent
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 15:05:32 GMT):<br/>
I am gonna try to ponder over this statement "the small order part of the bigger group is nonexistent in the subgroup."

Per roadmap discussion: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/ursa/Release+Planning+Feature+List
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Mon, 15 Jul 2019 17:47:04 GMT):<br/>
Incidentally I don't think we should maintain 3 sets of roadmap information ( the wiki, the docs repo, and Jira). I view that wiki page as a brainstorm list to generate items for the other two locations. The docs repo should include a high-level roadmap and jira should include epics based on that high-level roadmap with actionable stories at a finer grain.  
For that matter, we haven't really been using Jira extensively, so that's something we can discuss at the next meeting too. I think Jira is worthwhile only if we have an actively managed backlog. If our development culture is more about a few people self prioritizing things off the high-level roadmap, then jira is just overhead.

Most important point is that the subgroup is Cyclic subgroup , which makes the subgroup of Finite Prime Order. Being Cyclic Subgroup , you can have a generator , that can provide you base point for the curve.

@Dan Do you recall from the BLS discussion on Monday how Riad mentioned to use HKDF to hash to field elements instead of SHA256?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 15:34:04 GMT):<br/>
he didn't specify the salt or key values
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 15:34:22 GMT):<br/>
so I'm wondering if we can use domain specific parameters for these values @hartm 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 15:35:13 GMT):<br/>
as long as these values are decent size like 64 bytes each
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 15:57:36 GMT):<br/>
It was just to use HKDF in the obvious way.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 16:07:58 GMT):<br/>
lol are you going to let me get away with saying that? ;)
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 16:08:28 GMT):<br/>
They made reference to this IETF draft...

</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 16:44:27 GMT):<br/>
Right but the draft still shows SHA256
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 16:44:37 GMT):<br/>
what is the obvious way to use HKDF?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 16:44:46 GMT):<br/>
HKDF uses a salt and key
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 16:44:51 GMT):<br/>
then takes an input
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 17:21:39 GMT):<br/>
I was joking :) There's nothing obvious.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 17:44:52 GMT):<br/>
@Dan I thought the joke was obvious
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 17:44:57 GMT):<br/>
:wink: 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 17:45:43 GMT):<br/>
I'm hoping @hartm will say we can just set domain specific parameters for the HKDF values so each consumer can reproduce the hashing to field elements
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 18 Jul 2019 17:55:20 GMT):<br/>
I haven't studied it enough but I guess I would start with section 8.7 which specifies `sha256` and a `p` value and then use that as alluded to in 5.1 to produce `L` (I think `k` is 128? but that's probably specified in the bls12-381 defn.) and then do the extract/expand (hopefully already implemented by someone else) as described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5869 which refers to salt as optional. So yeah, just the obvious stuff. ;)

@lovesh first off, nice work on the paillier stuff. 
There's nothing wrong with the banner you put in, but for future reference this is the official recommendation:
https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/HYP/Copyright+and+License+Policy
Mentioning here so everyone is familiar. 
The copyright line is useful so if someone wants to use this file outside of Ursa, the file caries the attribution with it (which the downstream developer needs to advertise as part of the license requirements).
The spdx line is I guess just shorter than putting the whole license in. I would think the whole license is better than spdx but IANAL.

<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 10:22:37 GMT):<br/>
Maybe a stupid question, aren't SignKeys usually secret and so should be zeroized after use?
https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/blob/master/libursa/src/bls/mod.rs#L67
A problem is that some are handed over to C-code.
Anyway, I think that at least the Rust examples should be written so that the sign keys are zeroized manually e.g. sign_key1 should be zeroized after being used here:
https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/blob/master/libursa/src/bls/mod.rs#L325
Also as_bytes should have a warning in the documentation and warning that the bytes are secret and should not be copied.
Am I paranoid or is this a design decision because of the C-Code thing?
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 11:01:52 GMT):<br/>
Yes. Signing keys are not the only ones. There are other intermediate values that might need to be zeroed out depending on the protocol. IMO, a better but slightly expensive approach is to ensure that data is zeroed when it goes out of scope so that you don't explicitly forget to clear, eg https://github.com/lovesh/amcl_rust_wrapper/blob/remove-copying/src/field_elem.rs#L54. For smaller protocols explicitly clearing the data once you are done might be fine.
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 11:03:39 GMT):<br/>
On the examples you gave, the signing key is borrowed by signing algo so it cannot be cleared by the signing algo; the caller should clear it
</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 11:03:55 GMT):<br/>
zeroize 0.9 now has a derive so that it is quite easy to zeroize stuff.
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 11:04:42 GMT):<br/>
On the C-API, i think you are right, Ursa provides a free method but that might be a bad thing

</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 11:10:11 GMT):<br/>
Probably to late to change the C-API. I don't like the free stuff, better let the caller provide the memory and fail if it is too small. That shouldn't be a problem too often because the size if fixed in ursa MODBYTES

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 14:30:20 GMT):<br/>
Yes I did. He said SHAKE would work as well. His main argument for HKDF was groups are either using it already and its easy to hook up SHA2 to it and they are unlikely to switch. He's mostly just concerned about having a stronger hiding method that sha2
</p>

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 15:25:35 GMT):<br/>
clear_on_drop requires compiling a C file. I have used zeroize in my PR https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/pull/42/files#diff-ec778c91007df5961a4736dcc7844cc9R73

Riad also said SHA3 would be fine since the sponge construction is better hiding than sha2
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 15:34:28 GMT):<br/>
I'm also fine leaving it for HKDF since a high entropy salt and key assists in hiding possible low entropy inputs

:shrug: afaik, indy has dropped / is dropping their crypto implementations and relying on ursa. and ursa is mostly indy crypto code at this point.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 19 Jul 2019 17:44:58 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Sat, 20 Jul 2019 17:21:31 GMT):<br/>
That crate was published by Evernym staff but is based on very old AMCL which has been removed from github now. The new AMCL codebase (https://github.com/miracl/amcl) does not have an official crate, maybe we should help them deploy one.
</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Sat, 20 Jul 2019 21:26:08 GMT):<br/>
Or publish the amcl.rs code from Ursa as its own crate? Maybe I am  mixing stuff up. I am confused about what ursa, indy-crypto and libindy/src/utils/crypto are. BTW, I think that base58 and base64 should not be 'under' crypto. That is dangerous, I think.
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:16:19 GMT):<br/>
But AMCL is evolving and we have to keep a mirror and keep it synced. But set up a deploy pipeline on their github to automate publishing. AMCL is a low level crypto library. Ursa should be able to use several such libraries.  You can now consider indy-crypto as deprecated. Indy might decide to use crypto other than Ursa or maybe add some convenience wrapper on Ursa code. Thats was `libindy/src/utils/crypto` is about. Didn't get the danger about putting base58 and base64 under crypto.

'dangerous' because 'real' cryptographers yell a people who might think that baseXX encoding is encryption. 'dangerous' because some developers think that baseXX encoding is encryption. Better avoid both by using baseXX directly and remove them from crypto/something.

I am wondering why libindy/src/utils/crypto was not put into its own crate that then would be replaced by ursa.
</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:22:30 GMT):<br/>
It seems that all three places are currently being developed which seems to be a waste of time.
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:23:17 GMT):<br/>
Ok :smile: I would be hesistant to let developers touch code that don't understand difference between encoding and encryption. But i do realize that base58/64 is misplaced and is bad from a code organisation point of view. 
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:24:12 GMT):<br/>
On libindy/src/utils/crypto being a separate crate, would people outisde libindy want to use it? 
</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:24:29 GMT):<br/>
Well, I don't see any value in having a wrapper around base58 or base64. Indy should use those directly, I think
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:26:23 GMT):<br/>
I am speculating but maybe they wanted to make an Encoding interface and base58 or 64 will then be specializations. Maybe
</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:26:25 GMT):<br/>
Regarding 'whould others use libindy/src/utils/crypto'. No need to publish the crate just put is next to libindy
</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:28:02 GMT):<br/>
Abstraction has _some_ merits but not here, I think. If for example Verkey were redefined to use base64 instead of base58 then that would be another Verkey and I see no value in being this flexible.
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:28:08 GMT):<br/>
I am not a Rust expert so dumb question: whats the value of making it a crate in this case.
</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:28:43 GMT):<br/>
To have it separate from libindy and then replace it with ursa.

I saw that many devs from Evernym, DSR, Sovrin are involved in amcl. You said 'help them to publish amcl as a crate'. Yes, why isn't that a crate already? Really the low-level stuff operating on bytes only. No fancy wrappers. Just what is in the github
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:37:18 GMT):<br/>
We should evaluate that code. Can you join the next Ursa call? But my point in general was that Ursa is meant to be generic and i think most projects will build their own thin convenince wrapper specific to their needs but invaluable to others.
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:38:42 GMT):<br/>
Yes but your keypair creation code will expect an encoding trait.
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:41:42 GMT):<br/>
On "why isn't that a crate already", based on the my interactions with the AMCL author, he is the only guy responsible for managing this codebase so lack of time.
</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:42:32 GMT):<br/>
I hope that some common traits are evolving in Rust like Digest that is used by all cryptography crates so one implementation can be replaced by another as long as the trait is implemented.
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:43:11 GMT):<br/>
We didn't setup the CI in the first place but just published it. The code changed places since then.
</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:45:49 GMT):<br/>
Seems to be in our interest to help him then. Maybe he is in his Python script world that allows amcl to be configured to have support for some or other curve or algoritm. That is not needed for Rust, I think, because of Rust's features. The readme.txt https://github.com/miracl/amcl/tree/master/version3 goes in that direction. So why not publich this crate as is on crates.io?
</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:47:34 GMT):<br/>
Would you agree that @KitHat amcl should be replaced by this low-level amcl crate?
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:49:43 GMT):<br/>
I had actually tried a bit and failed using Travis CI. It was not picking up the security token correctly. I ended up  forking it for a mirror and publishing locally in the meantime. 
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:50:03 GMT):<br/>
The current AMCL crate should be fixed since its outdated and lot of fixes have been made since then
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:52:54 GMT):<br/>
Yes, some of that code does seem like useful to other folks like the password hashing
</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:53:36 GMT):<br/>
One way to fix @KitHat 's amcl is to fix the 404 repository link by setting it to https://github.com/miracl/amcl/tree/master/version3 and then change the version to 0.3.0 and then 'just' publish that code. naive?
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:54:08 GMT):<br/>
But we need to polish it a bit. We should have a generic interface in Ursa for these 
</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:55:08 GMT):<br/>
Ursa is a different matter. Ursa can then define or implement some useful trait that wraps amcl
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:56:44 GMT):<br/>
Doing it right (CI pipeline at miracl/amcl) does not seem to take much more effort so i prefer to do that. 
</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:57:37 GMT):<br/>
I do not disagree with that.
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 07:58:14 GMT):<br/>
My point was not regarding Ursa. But provinding interfaces for high level functions like password hashing with option for various trafeoffs (mem/CPU, etc)
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Sun, 21 Jul 2019 08:11:07 GMT):<br/>
I would create an issue https://github.com/miracl/amcl/issues like 'implement algo XYZ' and immediately send a PR for a Rust implementation. In the issue ask for help to implement in other languages. Usually people are nice and contribute.

Or publish the alg in its own crate and create a git submodule in your wrapper and amcl

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 23 Jul 2019 16:01:20 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder I'm assuming this is some kind of way to sample from a complicated distribution in constant time (although obviously I could be wrong).  Some distributions (i.e. Gaussians) are difficult to sample natively in constant time, so you might want to precompute parts of the probability density function to save yourself later.  This kind of thing is really tricky to get right, which is why I'm assuming the function is so complicated.

Its picking a point from a "lookup table". W is an array of multiples of a point and b is the multiplicand you want
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 24 Jul 2019 15:36:38 GMT):<br/>
another way to think about granularity for RFCs and how we think about evaluating potential features is in the context of the two layer interface. Specifically how does crypto-primitive-x get exposed at the upper API level. What does that upper level look like? 
At least for me, lack of that upper definition is what makes me uncomfortable with new primitives.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 24 Jul 2019 15:41:58 GMT):<br/>
Sounds good @Dan. Can you write an RFC that explains that?!?😂
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 24 Jul 2019 15:43:23 GMT):<br/>
Not to confuse things from the tail end of our discussion where I think we were talking about actually putting up RFCs for that upper layer interface.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 24 Jul 2019 15:54:08 GMT):<br/>
I'm going to need an RFC for that RFC for that RFC ;)
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 24 Jul 2019 15:54:42 GMT):<br/>
In all seriousness, we should start working on delineating the "cryptographer layer" from the "user interface" like we have sketched out before.  Dan brings up a good point.

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 24 Jul 2019 18:56:40 GMT):<br/>
@JonGeater That looks great.  I might use "projects" instead of "frameworks" since it is likely that more than just "frameworks" will use Ursa (Aries, for instance, might not be a full framework).  Projects is also simpler.  But I like your phrasing a lot!

@AxelNennker for you recent question about AMCL and Ursa. As far as I can see in source code of Ursa, @MALodder used the crate you have given link to, so there is no need make any changes in Ursa.
What about the CD pipeline for this external crate, it would be really great to implement such a solution. @esplinr I see no obstacles to implement such a pipeline but don't really know what team should do it.

Just checking my understanding: you want a longer string to get uniqueness in input. The hash function output would have the same entropy regardless of the input size.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 00:11:07 GMT):<br/>
The entropy is the amount of randomness in the calculation.  Hashing a deterministic string has no entropy since it is deterministic.  
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 00:22:14 GMT):<br/>
Entropy is information theoretic, not computational.
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 06:27:11 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for the correction regarding entropy definition :thumbsup: 
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 06:27:52 GMT):<br/>
But you longer string to get uniqueness in input?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 31 Jul 2019 14:46:20 GMT):<br/>
What do you mean by uniqueness here?  It implies you're sampling from a distribution.  Which distribution you are talking about is not clear.

<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 20:12:30 GMT):<br/>
Approved. But have asked 2 questions
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 07 Aug 2019 20:15:16 GMT):<br/>
PS sigs should go in libzmix
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 14:59:01 GMT):<br/>
@lovesh are you planning to implement the threshold PS sig?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 14:59:08 GMT):<br/>
otherwise why do we need them?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 15:02:49 GMT):<br/>
I think a point of discussion during the Ursa meeting yesterday was that PS should be proposed through RFC. 
Of course, RFC is a lengthy process so totally encourage us to sort out as much of the issues over chat/email/meeting before going into the authoring process.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 15:08:34 GMT):<br/>
An RFC for something like threshold PS sigs should be pretty simple though.  The interface is obvious (so no need to do much work there) and the question of need is pretty obvious to (do we need the threshold signatures).  So I don't think an RFC for this should be too onerous.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 15:08:58 GMT):<br/>
At least, I hope the RFC isn't too onerous.  And I also hope that it serves as a template for future interface documentation (so the effort isn't wasted).
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 15:29:38 GMT):<br/>
One should never assume that anything is obvious. :)
I don't mind saying I'm pretty ignorant of PS sigs and could not argue for or against another threshold scheme. I also couldn't explain how this would work well or badly with all the other schemes.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 08 Aug 2019 16:04:36 GMT):<br/>
@Dan All pairings-based threshold signatures are "more or less" the same--use Shamir secret sharing in the exponent, and use the pairing to compute the products needed for the secret sharing evaluation.  Now that you mention it, it might actually make sense to have a modular piece of code that does Shamir secret sharing.

what i meant by "I also couldn't explain how this would work well or badly with all the other schemes," is the other schemes in ursa. We should think about implications of having a library with a bunch of different groups/schemes. The paillier group, for example, feels very different to me than any of the elliptic groups. When we have all of these in the same library is there a way to compose across them or risks because it seems that you can when you shouldn't. So that kind of thing.

we should talk about containerizing the builds and how that relates to travis and other CI stuff.
Like in that PR above, if we just had a build container it could go right into that, and likewise the readme could just give a docker command instead of needing to track changes as we add / update things.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 16:46:46 GMT):<br/>
@Dan I believe travis is using containers already
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 16:47:07 GMT):<br/>
we should probably move to circleci because travis is being phased out
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 14 Aug 2019 17:26:17 GMT):<br/>
I mean using the docker files we maintain in the repo for build and then whatever system we use consumes those as well as anyone who wants to run a local build can just run e.g. `docker-compose up`

We don't have any signature scheme with PoK implemented for Anoncreds 2.0 so even if we don't use it for threshold sigs, it would be useful. Secondly, we wanted Zmix to support PS signatures anyway.

Hey! Is there a support or any plans for the Russian crypto in Ursa? 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 14:02:21 GMT):<br/>
the great thing about open source is you can add it to ursa and contribute it
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 14:02:55 GMT):<br/>
No one in particular is planning to add it, but its been designed such that its easy to add
</p>
<p><strong>Kamil_Salakhiev</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 14:34:38 GMT):<br/>
Great! What is the best way to start with it? I know that openssl supports Russian cryptography. Do you use openssl anyhow? If you do I think it is really easy to integrate
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 16:01:48 GMT):<br/>
Yes Ursa is using openssl but just for its Bignumber library. We do have an RFC for encryption https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa-rfcs/pull/6 that you can use as a guide
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 16:10:44 GMT):<br/>
I think the best pattern is to create modular interfaces. That way various national cryptos can be attached without needing to incorporate the code directly into Ursa.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 16:11:01 GMT):<br/>
I've put draft agenda up for tomorrow: https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/ursa/2019+08+21
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 17:29:50 GMT):<br/>
I thought Ursa already had a modular interface?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 20 Aug 2019 17:52:45 GMT):<br/>
it does, that's what I'm suggesting for @Kamil_Salakhiev to use

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 01:30:51 GMT):<br/>
Can a Double Ratchet algorithm be setup between multiple parties? If so what's the difference between that structure and an Async Ratchet tree?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 01:50:45 GMT):<br/>
Not really. Signal hides the complexity behind the scenes
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 01:51:12 GMT):<br/>
The Async tree is completely different in that it incorporates multiple keys

<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 09:09:03 GMT):<br/>
Oh! The Ursa meeting series has fallen off my calendar and I thought it was next week :( I have a customer meeting today :(
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 09:09:55 GMT):<br/>
I really wanted to talk about the sovereign algorithms and modular interfaces with @Dan and @Kamil_Salakhiev 
</p>

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 13:20:38 GMT):<br/>
no worries .. we can hit that next meeting.

<p><strong>Kirill_Vusik</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 13:40:45 GMT):<br/>
Hello everyone,
@dmitrylavrenov and I cannot attend the meeting today: we have conflicts with our meetings. Could we ask to record it?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 13:51:38 GMT):<br/>
конечно :)
</p>
<p><strong>Kirill_Vusik</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 13:53:24 GMT):<br/>
спасибо :)
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 13:56:25 GMT):<br/>
Usually Hart records and then posts the recording later.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 13:56:51 GMT):<br/>
I think he is at a conference though so that might make recording more difficult. I'm not sure.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 13:56:57 GMT):<br/>
I can still record.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 13:57:02 GMT):<br/>
I'll make sure to post.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 13:57:11 GMT):<br/>
It might take until this afternoon though.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 21 Aug 2019 22:31:22 GMT):<br/>
OK, I've added the recording.
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Thu, 22 Aug 2019 07:03:51 GMT):<br/>
@Dan I have skimmed over the EPID scheme and see that proof of non-revocation is linear (in size and time) in the size of revocation list (page 11, Sign.5) whereas in our case of merkle tree its logarithimic. Also in EPID, each non-revocation sub proof (for each item in revocation list) is much bigger and expensive since its a proof of inequality of discrete log

@MALodder 
Is ursa (master branch) published to crates.io automatically?
My PR was merged a couple days ago but the last available version on https://crates.io/crates/ursa was released in April.
It's a important issue for Libindy.
FYI @esplinr

we don't have master automatically published to crates.io
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 23 Aug 2019 19:31:16 GMT):<br/>
I can make a build if you want
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Sat, 24 Aug 2019 16:11:08 GMT):<br/>
Would we really want to do that before a full 1.0?
</p>
<p><strong>binhn</strong> (Sat, 24 Aug 2019 22:50:57 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>Artemkaaas</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 05:44:56 GMT):<br/>
Since Libindy migrated to Ursa crate. it's pretty important for us to have automatically published artifact as Indy-Crypto used to do.

<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 17:53:55 GMT):<br/>
@cam-parra I just added some codeowners files that reflect the current state of permissions for the four ursa repos
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 17:54:17 GMT):<br/>
if these are merged, I will turn on the codeowners option
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 17:54:49 GMT):<br/>
eventually, we'll have an automagic process for turning updates to that file into group updates. (not today though)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 18:03:44 GMT):<br/>
hi, I suck. I had to recreate https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa-python

<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 18:59:17 GMT):<br/>
no worries, we shall rebuild 
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 19:00:22 GMT):<br/>
also @rjones your pr has been merged you are good to turn on codeowners 
</p>
<p><strong>cam-parra</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 20:18:39 GMT):<br/>
are we good to add @JonGeater ?
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 20:26:45 GMT):<br/>
that is a question for you to answer. If you update the codeowners file, you'll still need to add him to your team manually (for now)
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Mon, 26 Aug 2019 20:27:38 GMT):<br/>
I now see that I added the codeowners file in the worst possible way. You can point to a team directly, which would make updates trivial. I would like to use codeowners to populate the groups... later
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 14:34:42 GMT):<br/>
He has my vote. 
</p>
<p><strong>JonGeater</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 14:41:18 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 15:19:08 GMT):<br/>
zmix is just the orchestration layer
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 27 Aug 2019 15:19:13 GMT):<br/>

I would like to propose that the Ursa-RFC PR #6 be put in final comment and merged in two weeks if there are no reasonable arguments. The PR has sat for 6 months without any new comments since april. Silence can be seen as agreeing and nothing further to add or uninvolvement.

We may need to append to it if we want to allow for more modular block cipher support, but that's probably not a huge issue.

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 16:00:43 GMT):<br/>
Actually more seriously I don't see any math notation in the tex file. It would be easier to review if we folded that text into md file. I say that not for busy work but because we can also better see the whole API in one doc. It looks to me for example that the object types alluded to in the md file don't align with those in the tex file. @hartm  @MALodder thoughts?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 16:16:25 GMT):<br/>
I'm okay changing this one to be markdown
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 17:19:45 GMT):<br/>
I guess the whole point of this is, in fact, to abstract away the math.  If you think it will be more convenient in markdown, I'm fine with that.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 29 Aug 2019 17:20:01 GMT):<br/>

I actually like the principle of TCF but I still don't know what Besu is actually supposed to be: generalising this architecture is capital-H-Hard.  If it's not generalised then I'm not sure why it needs to be a project.  Anyway, I think my questions/points are relevant to the concversation we just had in the call

According to a text book, the units in F[x] (ring of polynomials over field F) are exactly the nonzero elements of the field, F. That seems to ignore a lot of elements of F[x] which have inverses. For example the product of any monic polynomials whose degrees sum to phi(p) would seem to meet the definition of units. e.g. in Z_5, x * x^3 = x^4 = 1.
Am I misunderstanding the definition of the elements of the field of polynomials or is perhaps this definition of units in the text misleading. It is not accompanied by a proof.

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 18:44:04 GMT):<br/>
if you run `cargo bench`
it shows that key generation for PS is 2-3X slower than BBS+
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 18:44:27 GMT):<br/>
it also shows that signing for PS is 2-3X slower than BBS+
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 18:44:52 GMT):<br/>
however, its all in the order of milliseconds, so it may not be important
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 18:45:40 GMT):<br/>
for example, bbs keygen for 100 messages is `52.096 ms`
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 18:45:57 GMT):<br/>
ps keygen for 100 messages is `135.76 ms`
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 18:46:30 GMT):<br/>
bbs+ for sign without any prior commitments is `12.376 ms`
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 18:46:30 GMT):<br/>
bbs+ for sign without any prior commitments with 100 messages is `12.376 ms`
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 18:48:02 GMT):<br/>
ps for sign without any prior commitments is `31.222 ms`

signing with prior commitments (blinded signatures) will be faster than those

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 18:48:10 GMT):<br/>
that's on my personal macbook
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 20:12:48 GMT):<br/>
Depending on the feature selected, PS will have either faster sig or proof of knowledge of sig. The default feature (PS_G1G2) makes proof of knowledge faster since that is much more common occurence than signing
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 20:13:17 GMT):<br/>
Secondly is there some benchmark/test code you run to measure timing for BBS+
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 20:45:04 GMT):<br/>
That’s my next benchmark

<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 21:06:53 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Fri, 13 Sep 2019 21:07:16 GMT):<br/>
Iroha is the first of the HL DLTs to *move* to Ursa (Indy kind of supported it from the start).

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 20 Sep 2019 22:39:53 GMT):<br/>
In implementing a BLS Aggregated signature, short of batching the pairings in the verification step, I can’t think of any other optimizations to do. I mean mathematically, e(x, y),e(x,z) = e(x, y+z). So could some math optimization be done to speed up verification?
Essentially, can we limit the number of pairing computations

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 23 Sep 2019 03:45:14 GMT):<br/>
I personally think it’s good to have the Cargo.lock included so when we do releases it’s easier to audit exactly what crate versions and dependencies were used. I want to reject this PR
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 23 Sep 2019 03:45:33 GMT):<br/>
Side note: interesting Rust crate we should use

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 23 Sep 2019 03:50:02 GMT):<br/>
Also, I’m traveling this week and won’t be able to run the Sovrin Crypto call tomorrow. Lately Sovrin is interested in Threshold Signatures to be used to signing blind signatures that can be used for anonymous credentials. 

I’ve been doing lots of reading but haven’t really found anything yet worthy of implementing. If anyone knows of a good paper to look at let me know
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 23 Sep 2019 03:53:34 GMT):<br/>
Another thought was to apply Shamir Secret Sharing to PS signatures, but I’m unsure of the security proofs surrounding such a model. Would love to hear feedback on that idea.

The protocol would have a holder request the credential from N issuers. The issuers each sign with their share and the holder aggregates the shares to complete the signature. 

As long as M of N respond, the holder will have a complete signature to use for Selective Disclosure and Zero Knowledge Signature proof of knowledge 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 23 Sep 2019 03:55:38 GMT):<br/>
I believe PS signatures will make this math easier since BBS+ contains a fraction in the exponent of the signature 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 23 Sep 2019 03:57:01 GMT):<br/>
and PS is aggregations and multiplies

Hello All,
I just read the Hyperledger Ursa hyperledger-wiki page and I think the project looks very promising. But I wanted to know if I could use it in a project that I'm working on. It's an enterprise project and I'm concerned about the stability of the Ursa. Another thing, is Ursa a good solution for users' secret generation? We currently generate secret using bcrypt and appending a salt value to the generated value.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 23 Sep 2019 11:44:43 GMT):<br/>
Yes you can use Ursa. I wouldn’t be concerned about stability. We have two projects that are using it so we must keep it stable
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 23 Sep 2019 11:45:24 GMT):<br/>
Ursa doesn’t do password hashing yet. You’d be the first to request it
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 23 Sep 2019 17:57:07 GMT):<br/>
It’s open source, feel free to contribute 
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 07:15:14 GMT):<br/>
@KartikChauhan ursa includes two libraries, libursa and libzmix. Libursa should be pretty stable and is mostly including other vetted libraries. Libzmix is less stable and includes more freshly written novel systems generally related to zero knowledge techniques.

I have done a implementation of Coconut in Rust which uses Shamir secret sharing but that means presence of a trusted third party. I am in talks with the author and expect a review shortly. I have to still see how easy will be to use a DKG protocol. Here is the implementation https://github.com/lovesh/coconut-rust
</p>
<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Tue, 24 Sep 2019 13:00:13 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 03:12:06 GMT):<br/>
It's a sidechannel attack that appears to previously been known in academia, but this was an audit on a few different implementations.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 04:28:09 GMT):<br/>
No we haven't, but none of the ursa dependencies are on the affected list
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 04:30:48 GMT):<br/>
Its very similar to https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/023.pdf
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 04:32:07 GMT):<br/>
In talking to Nadia, one of the authors, she told me that libsodium and libsecp256k1 were not vulnerable to her attack
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 04:32:32 GMT):<br/>
ursa uses libsecp256k1
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 04:33:27 GMT):<br/>
I don't know if curve25519-dalek is vulnerable to that or not but again its not on the list 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 04:48:34 GMT):<br/>
perhaps @hartm could elaborate more on this too
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 04:49:09 GMT):<br/>
I haven't rigorously gone through the attack.  And you already talked to Nadia about it--she's the expert.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 04:49:21 GMT):<br/>
However, it seems to me that this involves a timing attack and the more the library has constant time implementations, the more resistant it should be
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 04:49:54 GMT):<br/>
and any language with a garbage collector isn't really constant time
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 04:50:33 GMT):<br/>
The paper you linked isn't a timing attack.  It's attacking people who didn't generate keys properly.

@dhuseby @MALodder @Dan and others, Are you opposed to always running the tests in release mode (`cargo test --release`)? Since tests take a long time in some of my PRs, TravisCI times out; this timeout can be fixed by running in release mode. The downside would be not getting a stacktrace that is as helpful as the debug mode's but one can debug the failing test on his local machine unless the failure is intermittent.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Tue, 08 Oct 2019 19:46:12 GMT):<br/>
No I’m okay with that

New paper by Marry Miller to use inner product argument to verify pairing product relations. Using this to verify several pairing product relations, the verifier computes constant number of pairings but 6(n + log(n)) exponentiations https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1177.pdf
They give an example of verifying BLS sigs under different messages but we can use this in delegatable credentials too when no of attributes is large or large chain
If we expose enough details in our code for anoncreds, proofs over lots of credentials can be very cheap to verify

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Mon, 14 Oct 2019 02:26:54 GMT):<br/>
Sounds good. Also, I'm evaluating the didcomm crypto layer and what we should be doing for a key agreement protocol to account for MITM and be more explicit about the security properties we're accounting for. Right now the two I've been looking at are TLS 1.3 and SSB's key exchange protocol https://dominictarr.github.io/secret-handshake-paper/shs.pdf
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Mon, 14 Oct 2019 02:27:02 GMT):<br/>
Are there other ones that I should be checking out?
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Mon, 14 Oct 2019 02:31:39 GMT):<br/>
One of the problems I've found with TLS is that they build around a "middlebox" which is essentially a benevolent MITM. However, when looking into what it's used for further I found a BYU paper that found that in some cases it's used by advertisers and malware to be malicious. I'd like to exclude this capability, so my question is ,"are there any key exchange protocols which are formally verified to not be susceptible to MITM attacks or at least define what is acceptably excluded in the security properties?"
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 14 Oct 2019 03:46:17 GMT):<br/>
None that I know of @kdenhartog 
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Mon, 14 Oct 2019 06:05:22 GMT):<br/>
Dang, I've got a sneaking suspicion that there aren't any out there because they would be a solution to the trust on first use problem.
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Mon, 14 Oct 2019 06:48:46 GMT):<br/>
Interesting question: I was just looking at the Montgomery curve wikipedia page and I noticed that they can be made equivalent to both twisted Edwards curves and Weierstrass curves. Does that mean that it's possible to map an Ed25519 key to an X25519 key and then map it to a Weierstrass curve (I presume this would be a non-common curve because the base points are different)?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 14 Oct 2019 14:01:33 GMT):<br/>
Montgomery curves are used for the Diffie Hellman computation typically because its more secure and efficient (correct me if I'm wrong @hartm) using the Montgomery ladder for that. Twisted Edwards and Weierstrass curves are used for computing signatures. So you could in theory map Ed25519 to the Weierstrass equivalent, why would you? Curve25519 is much faster on which to operate vs Weierstrass
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 14 Oct 2019 14:04:12 GMT):<br/>
@kdenhartog Key exchange protocols are always vulnerable to MITM attacks.  That's why the internet runs on certificates.  It's impossible without some kind of certificate or certificate-like thing to know who you are actually talking to, so MITM attacks are essentially always possible without this.  I'm not sure this answered your question, but I think what you're asking for is impossible.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 14 Oct 2019 14:06:08 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder I'm going to defer the questions on efficiency to use.  Which curves are more secure is not a settled matter, though--people have lots of different opinions.

This is interesting. In `https://github.com/mikelodder7/ursa/tree/bls` I have implemented what I call Normal BLS signatures and Small BLS signatures.

The difference being the signature group and public key groups are swapped. This means smaller signatures vs larger public keys (Small BLS) or larger signatures vs smaller public keys (Normal BLS).

When I benchmark the two, Small BLS wins in every case except for key generation. I'd like to see what others get. 
To generate the same report 
1- git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa
2- cd ursa
3- cargo bench -- bls

Hello to everyone,
I am trying out some of the `ursa`'s functionality in an iOS app, and I have a question regarding a c-callable methods.
This is my first experience of working with c-callable lib, so please bear with me :)

First I generate `master_secret`  with `ursa_cl_prover_new_master_secret` and pass the pointer to  `ursa_cl_master_secret_to_json` having a pointer to JSON `ptr_to_json`as an outcome.
So now, given this pointer I want to get the JSON itself.
In `swift` I manage to do so with the help of
 `UnsafeRawBufferPointer(start: <pointer>, count: <number_of_bytes_to_read>)`
The problem is that the length of the JSON string referenced by `ptr_to_json` can vary each time (from 81 to 87 bytes as far as understood, when run secret generation multiple time)
My question is what is the right approach to get JSON the values referenced by pointers that I receive as the result of `ursa` method execution? 
I see that there are other methods that result in pointers to JSON strings, and the length of generated JSONs will vary (I guess) as the structures of those JSONs are more complex that `{"ms": "SOME_BIG_INT"}`

Any tips or suggestions will be highly appreciated.
</p>

Good day to everyone, a short question about `master_secret`. found the following comment 
```
 // Master secret is now called link secret.
    pub static LINK_SECRET: &'static str = "master_secret";
```
In future releases all "master_secret" related entities will be eventually renamed to "link_secret", right?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 14:32:51 GMT):<br/>
that is correct
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 14:35:55 GMT):<br/>
What's happening is we keep trying to invent a better word for it. The latest thinking is "holder seal". The problem is trying to find a word that correctly conveys the right mental model. Master secret was definitely not correct because it implied that this was the grand secret if stolen means identity theft which is not the case

<p><strong>dnnn</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 17:47:55 GMT):<br/>
thanks for the info. as far as I understand this secret is participating in the process of creation of every credential for the holder of identity (thus "linking" them, and I see why "link secret" is one of the options for a name), so if it is stolen, doesn't it make credentials already issued with this secret compromised? I mean the thief would be able to generate proofs as the holder of identity (which is kinda identity theft)? I don't have a very deep understanding of the subject yet, so pardon me if I ask something silly. Just want to better understand your point about identity theft and stealing this secret
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 23 Oct 2019 17:49:32 GMT):<br/>
Just stealing the secret doesn't all impersonation. The attacker will have to steal ALL attributes in credentials and the credential signature. Then they can impersonate for a single credential.

So to do complete impersonation, the attacker needs ALL attributes and ALL signatures
</p>

Hello everyone. Can someone point to me the academic paper describing the security of the cryptographic accumulator implemented in ursa? The explanation here (https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/sdk/en/latest/docs/concepts/revocation/cred-revocation.html) is too high level and I haven't been able to find any other description of cryptographic accumulators in the hyperledger projects. I looked into Idemix (which was the starting point of the evernym implementation) and I believe the specification mentions the following paper "An Accumulator Based on Bilinear Maps andEfficient Revocation for Anonymous Credentials" by Camenisch, Kohlweiss and Soriente. Thanks for any useful info.

@MALodder - a question about anoncreds 2.0.  I've heard that there will be a feature (or could be - that's part of the question) that allows proving a claim from a credential and proving a self-asserted claim such that the verifier can be certain that the link secret used for the claim from the credential was also used for the self-asserted claim.  Is that true?

Scenario: An voter has a piece of gov't id. They use that to prove they are older than the voting age, but no other information from the credential.  They also sign a piece of data from the verifier (a unique ID for the election - same data handed to all prospective voters). The verifier knows:

1. They are old enough to vote, as attested by their gov't ID.
2. Their proof is associated with the unique ID for the election in a self-asserted claim.
3. The verifier knows that the same link secret was used for both claims, and hence can make sure the vote is only counted once.

For the latter, if the same user submits another vote, only one is counted - likely the last one.

Questions:

1. Is that feature (self-attested claims, signed/processed somehow the shows the same link secret was used for both claims) in anoncreds 2.0?
2. Are there any other crypto holes in the scenario I described?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 17:41:28 GMT):<br/>
So the user wouldn't create a self attested credential, but would just add self attested claims to the proof
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 17:42:57 GMT):<br/>
one of the values could be a vote ID, notice its not voterID, and if they see the same vote ID twice then they don't count it, the vote ID could be a one time use credential as well that is added to a spent set when its used
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 17:43:59 GMT):<br/>
self-asserted claims are capable in anoncreds 2.0
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 17:51:25 GMT):<br/>
And they have the attribute that the verifier knows that they used the same link secret as the credential?  That's the detail that I'm looking for.

</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 17:56:23 GMT):<br/>
the self asserted claims don't need a link secret because they are tied to the proof
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 14 Nov 2019 18:34:12 GMT):<br/>
OK - so there's no positive link between the link secret and the claim other than they are in the same proof.

While doing some experiments I came across the following issue and cannot figure out whether it's a bug in the library or an error on my side and was wondering if anyone might have tips to help further investigate. When I'm trying to verify a proof built with two different credentials from the same institution and with the same schema and same definition (so the only difference between the two credentials is the time and serial number), then verification fails. I recognise that this situation is rather unusual, but in principle I don't understand why this should fail.

Exception message? Link to code?
</p>
<p><strong>fabienpe</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:58:50 GMT):<br/>
No exception message. I think the issue is that prover_create_proof takes as last input revocation states and there is one state per credential definition, while the rev state is different for each credential (from the same definition).
</p>
<p><strong>fabienpe</strong> (Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:58:50 GMT):<br/>
No exception message (just proof verification fails). I think the issue is that prover_create_proof takes as last input revocation states and there is one state per credential definition, while the rev state is different for each credential (from the same definition).

<p><strong>lovesh</strong> (Fri, 22 Nov 2019 05:35:25 GMT):<br/>
Which lib/which file has the function `prover_create_proof`? Can't find in the current Ursa codebase

Check `https://github.com/fabienpe/indy-sdk/blob/master/samples/python/src/getting_started_2.py`  At line 312 you can choose issuing 1 or more Transcripts from Faber. If one is issued, then all goes well. If two are issued, then proof with Acme fails. The trace says `TRACE:indy.libindy.native.ursa.cl.verifier:	xxxx\.cargo\registry\src\github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823\ursa-0.2.0\src\cl\verifier.rs:317 | ProofVerifier::verify: <<< valid: false`

@MALodder I created https://dev.azure.com/Hyperledger/ursa-dev/_build which points to https://github.com/hyperledger-cicd/ursa/tree/azure_pipelines .

On line 372 (https://github.com/fabienpe/indy-sdk/blob/master/samples/python/src/getting_started_2.py#L372), you have `faber['job_certificate_cred_rev_id']` and not `faber['job_certificate_cred_rev_id_%s' % i]`. Is that ok since revocation idx will be same for both creds? And can you check if revocation index is same for both creds?

On a different note, it would be clearer  if you created variables (in loop's scope) for `_%s % i`

<p><strong>fabienpe</strong> (Mon, 25 Nov 2019 15:31:02 GMT):<br/>
Well that was quick hack from the getting_started code that you are familiar with, because I'm unable to provide the actual code in which I came across the issue. The cred_rev_id is in fact not used in that example since I don't revoke any credential. This index does get updated: 1 then 2.
</p>

I've changed the %s' % s to in-loop local variables and pushed that new code.

I looked more and it does not make sense to try it with Ursa APIs as its very clear in Ursa which cred sig, which rev reg state is used. The problem might be when the wallet or ledger is being queried

Are there any performance metrics on Ursa CL API? I have tested few methods with a great success until I get to  ursa_cl_issuer_new_credential_def(), which takes forever to complete. I am testing in a range of 1-100 attributes and getting response in average 10s on my machine. Is it supposed to be that slow or am I doing something wrong? I assume all Ursa API is synchronous so the code is computing that long, not sleeping somewhere?

<p><strong>Jack1477</strong> (Fri, 06 Dec 2019 19:51:10 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder  is the algorithm not-symmetric in terms of performance then? I mean, long generation of the credentials pub/prv keys and coreectness proff, but fast signing/proving with them later? Or should I expect other calls to be long as well? What is the ETA for anoncreds 2.0?

Hey everyone, splinter (https://github.com/Cargill/splinter/) has an optional feature for ursa-compatible signing that currently uses ursa 0.1, but it's currently broken so we're trying to fix it. We only need secp256k1 signing, so we tried updating the dependency to `ursa = { version = "0.3", optional = true, default-features = false, features = ["native_secp256k1"] }`, but it fails with this error: ```error[E0463]: can't find crate for `blake2`
  --> /Users/seeley/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/ursa-0.3.0/src/lib.rs:29:1

<p><strong>ltseeley</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 18:57:19 GMT):<br/>
It seems the feature's dependencies aren't configured properly
</p>
<p><strong>ltseeley</strong> (Fri, 13 Dec 2019 19:03:13 GMT):<br/>
Or perhaps it's just not clear how to specify the features

<p><strong>Jack1477</strong> (Sun, 15 Dec 2019 20:35:33 GMT):<br/>
I am writing the wrapper for Ursa CL and I am stuck on testing the C-API for CL. I have successfully implemented "demo" test scenario with a wrapper  (found in src/cl/mod.res line 1635) and almost done with "demo_revocation" (found in src/cl/mod.rs line 1754), but got stuck on processing signature in the second one. Without revocation processing works fine (ursa_cl_prover_process_credential_signature()) , however when I try it with revocation I get following error: "Message: Invalid structure Caused by: Invalid Signature correctness proof c != c" . I am trying to debug step by step why this error occurs but without any success yet. Is anyone here able to give me some kind of tip what the issue might be? What I mean by that - is there some kind of "most frequent reason" to why this error pops up? Or is it rather not common problem?

I suspect something might be wrong on my side with generation of new tails, but already spent few hours on it, serializing and deserializing contents of each tail and tails generator and I am unable to spot the problem.
Another potentential reason I suspect might be happening is that one of the objects not marked as mutable is mutating somewhere and it happens desync between my wrapper and C-API. 

If anyone had this problem with C-API before and was able to solve it or can share some word of advice where to look to solve the issue I would love to hear it.  
</p>
<p><strong>Jack1477</strong> (Sun, 15 Dec 2019 20:56:23 GMT):<br/>
One of the things I am confused about are the states of revocation registry and revocation tail generator that need to be passed between different API calls.

For example - when calling ursa_cl_issuer_sign_credential_with_revoc() it is required to pass revocation registry , revocation tails generator , FFITake and FFIPut functions pointers. During this function call both revocation registry and revocation tails generator are mutated. 

Then, after calling that I need to create witness with ursa_cl_witness_new() that requires revocation registry delta and revocation tails generator. In what state does the revocation tails generator need to be with this call? The original one before being mutated by ursa_cl_issuer_sign_credential_with_revoc() or mid-state or final state ?

The same problem applies to next call ursa_cl_prover_process_credential_signature(). This function requires revocation registry to be passed. Once again - revocation registry in which state? initial, mid-state or final?




</p>
<p><strong>Jack1477</strong> (Sun, 15 Dec 2019 21:13:17 GMT):<br/>
In my previous posts I used the terms of initial , mid and final state. Its the confusion that I have due to existance of two implementations of TailAccessor in the code.

FFITailsAccessor for C-API and SimpleTailsAccessor being used inside the code.

FFITailsAccessor allows userland code to define how the tails are generated/accessed.

SimpleTailsAccessor on creation creates ALL tails possible and stores them in memory.

In demo_revocation test scenario which I am trying to implement, the tail being requested is identified with revIdx = 5. The size of tails accessors is calculated to 11.

Here's what I do not understand. The mutated result for revocation registry depends on which tail has been accessed and the state of tails generator. Since the FFITailsAccessor allows custom definiton of take function that would also mean that it allows arbitrary state changes at this point. For example, my current implementation generates tails up to highest revIndx that has been asked (5 in this example). If instead I used SimpleTailsAccessor it would generate 11 from the start. By logic the state of revocation registry / revocations tails generator should be same after generating X tails. But if one generates X and other generates Y it would mean the states are no longer equal.

Henceforth I see thre potentential states here.
1. Initial state which is state before any tail has been generated.
2. Mid-state after X tails have been generated but there is room for more (allowed by FFITailsAccessor)
3. Final-state after ALL tails have been generated (enfored by SimpleTailsAccessor)
 
I am not sure if the difference between 2 and 3 is relevant to the outcome of C-API calls?

<p><strong>pschwarz</strong> (Mon, 16 Dec 2019 14:44:04 GMT):<br/>
True, but it looks like `"native_secp256k1"` depends on that `blake2` dependency (or it isn't properly guarded by a `cfg` annotation).

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 16 Dec 2019 15:43:58 GMT):<br/>
not really, the cfg's need to be updated so that each feature is more independent. secp256k1 just depends on having a valid hash algorithm that outputs 256 bits

Keep in mind that the tests are not clear as to who is doing what, just that the steps work properly. The Prover generates the master secret and blinds it prior to sending it to the issuer

Hey all. I've been tracking the Xchacha20 draft rfc on the IETF CFRG mailing list and there's been little discussion which can move this forward. There is an implementation already in libsodium and I think it would be a good addition for ursa to support. However, there's been some hesitation about the nonce generation on the mailing list in the past and it may be useful to have some cryptoanalysts take a look at it to get the work moving forward. @hartm do you know of anyone who could take a look at it and provide feedback on the mailing list? @MALodder or @lovesh could you ask Dmitry K. to take a look at it as well and provide some feedback? I'd like to be able to use this with the Aries work, but haven't had much luck getting things moving on the mailing list, so any help or feedback would be appreciated.

Are the values of the attributes in the credentials always supposed to be numbers? (https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/blob/0d6c176f2f72417cd0111ded4d63e434bf0f4d03/libursa/src/cl/mod.rs#L90). How can I handle string values in the credential?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 03 Jan 2020 02:42:27 GMT):<br/>
Yes they must be for the crypto to work. The most common method is to use sha256 to convert the string
</p>
<p><strong>sanjaysb</strong> (Fri, 03 Jan 2020 04:46:34 GMT):<br/>
but sha256 is one way right?

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Sat, 04 Jan 2020 19:47:23 GMT):<br/>
yes
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Sat, 04 Jan 2020 19:47:38 GMT):<br/>
you still need to store the original value
</p>
<p><strong>sanjaysb</strong> (Mon, 06 Jan 2020 04:19:27 GMT):<br/>
ok. So in the credential given by an issuer you only have the hash values for string attributes. The actual attributes are shared to holder unsigned. The holder when submitting a claim to the verifier, will share the actual values as well which the verifier can verify using the signed hash value in the credential. Am I thinking right?

No but even if we did it wouldn’t fix that particular problem. Indy should change their code to use ursa for their keys and encryption instead of using sodium oxide for it

<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Thu, 09 Jan 2020 14:07:11 GMT):<br/>

Hi all, I work for LedgerDomain, a Hyperledger member, and I'm looking to talk to a crypto expert or two to vet a scheme for storing hash records for private documents.  If anyone has any recommendations for who to talk to, I would much appreciate it -- please email me at victor.dods@ledgerdomain.com -- if a formal consulting arrangement for such vetting is warranted, then that's certainly an option.  Thanks all! :)

Yes that is what I would need ```After getting API Token from PyPI, you can set secrets on GitHub by clicking “Settings” -> “Secrets” on the project page. Using my example workflow, you should set __token__ for PYPI_USERS , and a token starting with pypi- got on PyPI configuration for PYPI_PASSWORD .```

Hi, guys, I have some questions about the Hyperledger Indy focusing on the credential revocation. Thank you for your help.

The credential revocation of Indy refers to https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/hipe/en/latest/text/0109-anoncreds-protocol/README.html
The CKS accumulator refers to this paper https://eprint.iacr.org/2008/539.pdf

Questions

1. In the Non-revocation Credential Cryptographic Setup phase, a type-III pairing is chosen. Is there any suggestion while choosing all three groups G1, G2 and GT? For example, how many bits is the order r suggested to be? By the way, is there some special purpose to use a type-III pairing? The referred CKS accumulator uses a type-I pairing which G1 = G2. The CKS accumulator could be referred here.

2. The architecture includes an accumulator system that the issuer side stores the states (V and {g'_i} for all i in [1, 2L]) and the blockchain stores the indices V and accumulator acc.

By the definition of accumulator on wiki:
A cryptographic accumulator is a one way membership function. It answers a query as to whether a potential candidate is a member of a set without revealing the individual members of the set.

We have the following questions:

It seems not a one-way function if everyone can observe V and acc together from the blockchain. The mapping of indices i and parameters g'_i could be gradually found after several accumulator updates.

Following the above question, after the mapping relationship is totally observed, I believe the membership of the current accumulator is entirely revealed.

If V is stored on the ledger, the size of V keeps growing alone with more holders get involved in. In my opinion, the size of a cryptographic accumulator should be independent from the number of members.

In short, we estimate that the indices V may not be suitable to be published and stored on the ledger. Please feel free to indicate if we misunderstood something.

Thank you very much.

Hi.
1. Type 3 pairings are more efficient to compute.
2. You can consider g_i as static state (it never changes so it should not be called state) while indices of V form dynamic state.
On the "one-way ness", the indices of V are needed for updating an old witness and to ensure that the same entries are not added twice in the accumulator or an entry that is attempted to being removed is indeed present (the technique to remove is not mentioned in the paper but you can remove by multiplying with the inverse of the entry). Publishing the indices is not a problem in our case since credential holder never reveals his index but proves that an entry for his index (which is present in his credential) is present in the accumulator as well. 
But if you did not need the ability for old witnesses to be updated, you can avoid publishing indices of V and only the issuer should keep them. The credential holders can then request the issuer to very efficiently compute the witness as it knows the trapdoor (the paper does not describe this but the implementation i link does so). This however does require the issuer to stay online. This is my implementation that does removal and updates using trapdoor, https://github.com/lovesh/cks_accumulator. But note that the choice of groups is different than indy, i keep witness and accumulator in G1 for efficiency

Uninstalling `brew remove libtool` allowd me to build from source and run to test successfully. `cargo build` of libsodium-sys still fails though... libsodium-sys is using its own libtool. I guess that leads to the tests to fail.

<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Thu, 23 Jan 2020 19:39:58 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 00:48:25 GMT):<br/>
I'm going, and can help out if needed. But you or @MALodder would be better qualified. Once you know your schedules at the conference, let me know if you are available.
</p>
<p><strong>esplinr</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 00:48:56 GMT):<br/>
@brentzundel would also do great.
</p>
<p><strong>brentzundel</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 02:13:10 GMT):<br/>

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 03:32:12 GMT):<br/>
@esplinr You're plenty qualified.  I doubt people at the booth are going to be asking theoretical questions, which is basically what I'm good for answering anyway.
</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 10:01:15 GMT):<br/>
Maybe help the author of https://crates.io/crates/rust-argon2 to  achieve version 1.0.
I don't agree with the author that the limitations he describes are really limitations. For example he writes that the implementation is not optimized. I think that password hashing does not really need to be optimized, often it is desirable to be slow. The other thing he writes about clearing memory after use: I guess this was written before zeroize 1.x 
</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 10:31:13 GMT):<br/>
Looked at the zeroizing and noticed that rust-argon2 just does not attempt to clean the memory that is left to the caller, which is OK, I think.
</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 10:32:07 GMT):<br/>
Wondering why argon2 is not part of ring...
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 24 Jan 2020 18:35:00 GMT):<br/>
Ring just supports algorithms mostly from boringssl. The author has done some interesting trade offs that I’m not sure if I agree with

The Linux Foundation’s CommunityBridge engineers are working on a tool to measure the health of critical open source projects and one of the key areas identified is QA Testing.  They request that our communities provide  honest and detailed information on testing tools and methodologies you use in your projects for us to come up with a detailed analysis, which they will share with all respondents and projects. https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/9H5G2GV. It’s only 5 questions long.

Would you mind setting the dependency to zeroize to "1" instead of to "1.0"? The current version of zeroize is 1.1.0 The author of aes-gcm does use "1" as well.

</p>
<p><strong>AxelNennker</strong> (Tue, 28 Jan 2020 12:13:56 GMT):<br/>
Hm, just saw that ursa-0.3.1 is out already. I missed that because libindy's Cargo.lock is still at ursa-.0.3.0

</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 14 Feb 2020 04:29:35 GMT):<br/>
I don't speicifically but BCGov has more implementation experience in this area. I would take to @andrew.whitehead @swcurran for more info

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 14 Feb 2020 15:41:56 GMT):<br/>
We have thought about that, but have not done it.  There is some work being done on the implementation right now and that seems like a good improvement that we'll consider.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 14 Feb 2020 15:43:00 GMT):<br/>
Our currently plan is that Anoncreds 1 will be for limited use cases and hence relatively small tails file. Hopefully when we get to broader use cases, Anoncreds2 will be in place in indy/Aries agents.

"The adversarial model presented by trusted execution envi- ronments (TEEs) has prompted researchers to investigate unusual attack vectors."

I think this is a real issue: if you presetn something as 'unbreakable', or even set the context as 'attack by very motivated adversaries' then you make the perfect the enemy of the good and any crazy-ass edge case failure blows up the whole value proposition.  

Don't get me wrong, I think it's very important to understand the limits of any tchnology and build systems accordingly, but it's also really important with research like this to know how likely it is that YOUR adversary will have THIS capability.

I feel rather the same way about emissions-based side channels in mobile devices: they're very clever and occassionally relevant, but in general the risks of someone following you around at close quarters with a directional antenna and you NOT NOTICING are pretty bloody unlikely, and yet the scare about those can put people off putting in place some good basic protections for the pareto attack case

Is there a reason why `issued` and `revoked` are tracked on revocation registry deltas? I can't see that they are used anywhere, but they get published to the ledger and could lead to much larger deltas (adds 135K if you naively revoke an entire 25K-entry registry)

<p><strong>Artemkaaas</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 18:52:33 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder 
Is Ursa function `keypair` of `Ed25519Sha512  SignatureScheme`   with passing seed  equal to libsodium `crypto_sign_ed25519_seed_keypair?
</p>
<p><strong>Artemkaaas</strong> (Thu, 19 Mar 2020 18:57:05 GMT):<br/>
I try to use it for transactions signing but when I use `KeyGenOption::UseSeed` option for keys generation I receive the different keys.
When I use `KeyGenOption::FromSecretKey` option for keys generation the generated keys and signature are correct.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 20 Mar 2020 02:33:16 GMT):<br/>
No they are not the same
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 20 Mar 2020 02:34:59 GMT):<br/>
Libsodium computes the SHA512 hash of the seed and takes the first 32 bytes, clamps it and that's the private key
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 20 Mar 2020 02:36:13 GMT):<br/>
Ursa computes the sha256 hash of the seed which then seeds ChaCha which is then used to randomly generate 32 bytes
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 20 Mar 2020 02:36:33 GMT):<br/>
those bytes are clamped to be the private key

<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 01 Apr 2020 12:47:21 GMT):<br/>
what was the reason for switching @MALodder? Last I was reading libsodium's implementation matches how FIPS 186-5 defines it and how RFC 8032 defines it. 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 01 Apr 2020 12:48:41 GMT):<br/>
I’m not aware that libsodium does that but will take a look
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 01 Apr 2020 12:53:03 GMT):<br/>
Might be worth looking at Openssl as well. I think they've preemptively implemented against RFC 8032 which is probably why NIST defined things the way they did
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 01 Apr 2020 12:53:24 GMT):<br/>
This is the implementation for OpenSSL https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/97b50f67f212589661c9f1edd5285822c6cc642b/crypto/ec/curve25519.c#L5447

@kdenhartog what you're pointing at is signing not key generation
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 01 Apr 2020 13:44:49 GMT):<br/>
ursa is completely compliant with FIPS 186-5 in that way
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 01 Apr 2020 13:45:46 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, key generation is here: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/97b50f67f212589661c9f1edd5285822c6cc642b/crypto/ec/curve25519.c#L5584
</p>
<p><strong>kdenhartog</strong> (Wed, 01 Apr 2020 13:46:52 GMT):<br/>
Similarly RFC 8032 is here https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032#section-5.1.5
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 01 Apr 2020 13:47:50 GMT):<br/>
What @tomislav and indy are wanting is the creation from a seed - https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/blob/master/src/libsodium/crypto_sign/ed25519/ref10/keypair.c#L18
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 01 Apr 2020 13:48:18 GMT):<br/>
we are following RFC8032 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 01 Apr 2020 13:48:43 GMT):<br/>
what we are doing differently is seeding the random number generator that is passed to the dalek library
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 01 Apr 2020 13:49:35 GMT):<br/>
https://docs.rs/ed25519-dalek/1.0.0-pre.3/ed25519_dalek/struct.Keypair.html
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 01 Apr 2020 13:49:47 GMT):<br/>
They only allow creating the keys from an RNG
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 01 Apr 2020 13:50:00 GMT):<br/>
otherwise you have to handle the bytes and the clamping manually

They were using an parameter in a mutable context, and using the same variable as both input and output (by reference) from a method call.  Google's code reviews should have caught this as it's a fairly run of the mill no-no.  But your code reviews are only as good as the code reviewer.

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Sun, 19 Apr 2020 23:25:19 GMT):<br/>
 Thanks for your questions!  Ursa is a library, rather than a system, so there really isn't a thread model other than the definitions of the primitives themselves.  Questions b) and c) are all really a matter of opinion since we are implementing standard or published primitives.  Question d) depends on how you are using the primitives.

Hello everyone,
not sure if this is the right channel to ask this. Correct me if I'm wrong.

So, I have been trying to get my project that depends on Ursa to compile to wasm. Is there any trick to it? Because right now I get a bunch of error messages when trying to compile. Packages like secp256k1 and clear_on_drop always give compile errors during the build. Is there a working example of a project using ursa that is being compiled to wasm, or some guide lying around? 

Thank you.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 01 May 2020 04:46:23 GMT):<br/>
I believe the command you need is `cd libursa`
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 01 May 2020 04:47:36 GMT):<br/>
`wasm-pack build — —no-default-features —features=portable_wasm`
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 01 May 2020 04:50:04 GMT):<br/>
There are other flags that can remove everything but secp256k1

Hi everyone. I have some questions , so Ursa libzmix is wasm friendly? Can I generate a bulletproof proof from an arbitrary computation like zk-snarks? say I want to prove that a public key belongs to a merkle tree and then verify a signature with it where the public key is a witness, can I compute that into a bulletproof? Is somewhere a doc/tutorial to learn how to code and generate a bulletproof? thanks!

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 11 May 2020 14:12:52 GMT):<br/>
@madiazp Ursa is wasm compatible, in theory libzmix is too but we haven't tested it yet to be. Nor are there any interfaces exposed to wasm yet. However, its not hard to do and contributions are welcome. To answer your other questions, the answer is yet you can do merkle proofs using the bulletproofs_amcl portion of the code. The documentation we have is here https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/tree/master/libzmix/bulletproofs_amcl

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 11 May 2020 14:13:35 GMT):<br/>
@alexpuig good question, is there a specific feature of ursa you are looking to use? That will help with determining which sections you will need to include

Good! So there isn't (yet?) a DSL (like zokrates or circom ) for bulletproof ursa, and if I want to code some constrains I have to do it in a rust program that calls the lib? and what is exactly is zkl then? thanks!

I seem to have a problem with creating a credential definition when compiling ursa to wasm. I can see that ursa uses glass_pumpkin (https://github.com/mikelodder7/glass_pumpkin) library instead of openssl to generate primes when enabling wasm-compatibility. This library never finishes generating prime numbers there (well, at least I stopped running it after 30 mins). Is this a known behaviour? 

I was able to recreate that behaviour when creating a new project depending only on glass_pumpkin. In there i run the following code which never stops executing:

```
use glass_pumpkin::safe_prime;

fn main() {
  let size = 1024;
  let prime = safe_prime::new(size).unwrap();
}
```

Hey, I'm not going to be available for the call next week. On the off chance a lot of other people are out for the short week (U.S. Memorial Day) I thought I'd see about sliding the meeting back a week. If not, I'll just watch the replay. 
If we do meet 6/3 I've got some old GS slides I dust off for discussion. Maybe update them to a bullet proofs context.

```
warning: use of deprecated item 'amcl_wrapper::group_elem_g1::G1Vector::inner_product_var_time_with_ref_vecs': Please use the `inner_product_var_time` function instead
```

I wouldn't mind cleaning this up, if it's easy. But am I setting myself an impossible task?

</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 08 Jun 2020 16:42:19 GMT):<br/>
yes we discussed it and the cryptographers need more information about @andrew.whitehead's idea
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 08 Jun 2020 16:42:32 GMT):<br/>
there were concerns about privacy leaks when the tree is updated
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 08 Jun 2020 16:44:11 GMT):<br/>
because the tree shape is constantly changing
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Mon, 08 Jun 2020 16:44:19 GMT):<br/>
Been thinking about that. Is that because of the bit updates being visible to all?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 08 Jun 2020 16:48:38 GMT):<br/>
no its like path 1 was valid before but is not now but you proved in path 2. Assuming paths are zero-knowledge it shouldn't be a problem but we just want to check it

Hi, were currently using ursa with CL ... one question is, when i create a Schema with 3 fields .... then creating a definition out of this and issue a credential with only 2 fields ... afterwards creating a proof request of 1 field ... the created proof cannot be verified and always returns revoked. When i instead issue a credential with all 3 fields the proof works
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Fri, 12 Jun 2020 13:35:43 GMT):<br/>
AFAIK you can't issue a credential with less attributes than defined in the credential definition. You have to provide at least an empty string.

</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 21 Jun 2020 13:39:48 GMT):<br/>
I'm trying to do a `cargo run` on Windows for an app built using indy-vdr, which in turn uses Ursa.  After a few bumps, I have it to the point of compiling Ursa, whenre where  I'm getting 493 Unresolved External errors on the linking process.  Presumably, when it is compiling the source, it is not including external symbols.

Example: ` libopenssl_sys-93af6d3e2a3e76ab.rlib(openssl_sys-93af6d3e2a3e76ab.openssl_sys.dpmbxioq-cgu.9.rcgu.o) : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol _SSL_CTX_callback_ctrl referenced in function __ZN11openssl_sys4tls138SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_servername_callback17h954b337050a52513E`

Anyone ever run this on Windows?  Any ideas for how to deal with this?

Failing step: `Compiling ursa v0.3.4 (https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa?rev=5444d41707c05399e191c2290d2767658d14fbc4#5444d417)`

@swcurran do you have a test app I could compile? I see that the compilation works on AppVeyor
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 21 Jun 2020 18:26:08 GMT):<br/>
So for this issue, @andrew.whitehead changed the app build script, I think to download vs. build ursa.  So that solved the issue.
**
That said, I did try building ursa itself, following the prereq instructions here: https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/blob/master/docs/build-environment.md#windows-10

It went pretty well, until I hit a compile error here on compiling Ursa itself:

```

For the original issue - the repo I was using is: https://github.com/andrewwhitehead/endorser-tool
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 21 Jun 2020 18:27:11 GMT):<br/>
OK; I was building with WSL2
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 21 Jun 2020 18:27:22 GMT):<br/>
I'm on plain Jane Windows 10
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Sun, 21 Jun 2020 18:27:25 GMT):<br/>
Actually I'm just building with `cl` instead of `cl_native` so there's no openssl dependency, it only needs the data types anyway
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Sun, 21 Jun 2020 18:28:00 GMT):<br/>
Ah...so slower but that's not a big issue for this app.
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Sun, 21 Jun 2020 18:28:36 GMT):<br/>
should Ursa be publishing to AppVeyor or similar?
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Mon, 22 Jun 2020 16:00:48 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran your issue makes me wonder if the W10 vs WSL2 implementations of the Rust libstd has different type sizes for standard types.
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Mon, 22 Jun 2020 16:01:00 GMT):<br/>
like usize might be different
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Mon, 22 Jun 2020 16:01:37 GMT):<br/>
I know on Linux it is an alias for u64 but on Win10 it *might* be a u128 :man_shrugging_light_skin_tone:

</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Mon, 22 Jun 2020 16:02:18 GMT):<br/>
says in the error. thankyouverymuch awesome rustc errors
</p>
<p><strong>dhuseby</strong> (Mon, 22 Jun 2020 16:03:06 GMT):<br/>
my guess is ByteArray is a naked pointer and ByteBuffer is pointer + length of buffer
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Mon, 22 Jun 2020 16:11:36 GMT):<br/>
ByteBuffer source says '`i64` is used for the length instead of `u64` and `usize` because JNA has interop issues with both these types'
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 22 Jun 2020 18:07:51 GMT):<br/>
ursa does build in AppVeyor and tests cl as long as openssl is already installed

@eduelias its hard to help at the general level, can you be more specific
</p>
<p><strong>eduelias</strong> (Wed, 24 Jun 2020 15:46:23 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder I'm trying to call the module inside the pkg folder, generated by building libursa using wasm-pack. But when I try to use it on Nodejs I get a lot of import issues (because it's clear that this pkg is not for nodejs) and, when I try to import it on my Front-end project, it has some loading issues with CORS and other stuff so, what I need, is an example on how you guys are using it to start. My final goal is to extract the CL signature and generate CLAIM_DEF transactions using a browser.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 24 Jun 2020 15:47:01 GMT):<br/>
I have done this in the past, I'll see if I can find where and how I did that
</p>
<p><strong>eduelias</strong> (Wed, 24 Jun 2020 15:47:17 GMT):<br/>
I am not that familiar with WASM, but quite experienced with nodejs/javascript.

I think someone gave a presentation on sha3 last year? I recall seeing slides that explained the sponge construction better than what I'd seen elsewhere (or it could have been the presenter just describing it better). Do we have that retained somewhere? Possibly it was one of the chaps from Dfinity. Anyone know what I'm talking about?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 18:07:09 GMT):<br/>
I don't remember this, but it's entirely possible that it happened.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 18:08:08 GMT):<br/>
It was the same meeting where you agreed you owed me that money.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 25 Jun 2020 18:09:52 GMT):<br/>
Actually, maybe it was a presentation on the new hash algorithm (we adopted? planned to adopt?) and that algorithm might have also used the sponge construction. I'm just filled with useful details here.
</p>

Hi, is there a gadget of digital signatures for bulletproofs?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 29 Jun 2020 04:48:21 GMT):<br/>
Like verifying a signature with Bulletproofs?
</p>
<p><strong>S3bb1</strong> (Tue, 30 Jun 2020 12:19:15 GMT):<br/>
Hi all, when will the next version of libursa released on crates.io? Because when looking at crates.io the last released version is 0.3.2 but when looking at the cargo.toml in libursa it points to 0.3.4
</p>
<p><strong>madiazp</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 01:45:31 GMT):<br/>
yeah, something like proof he knowledge of a digital signature and it corresponding public key such that the hash of the public key belongs to a certain list or something like that, both pk and signature are witness.
</p>
<p><strong>madiazp</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 01:47:16 GMT):<br/>
the part of hash and list are covered with posseidon and membership of a list gadgets, but there is no schema to verify a digital siganture
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 01:48:00 GMT):<br/>
that's not implemented yet, and the only thing I'm aware of is JubJub from ZCash
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 01:48:26 GMT):<br/>
If you want proof of knowledge of a signature, we have BBS+ or PS signatures that can do that without gadgets
</p>
<p><strong>madiazp</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 01:56:24 GMT):<br/>
so, is the jubjub (or babyjubjub ) curve bulletproof friendly? like the same way they are to zk snark? I'm truly interested in a implementation of the eddsa  protocol based on jubjub for bulletproof.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 01:57:25 GMT):<br/>
That's how zcash works. Its a SNARK that does two checks, is the UTXO in the set of spendable txns and is the signature valid
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 01:57:43 GMT):<br/>
@brentzundel has studied it more than I have
</p>
<p><strong>madiazp</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 03:24:46 GMT):<br/>
yeah, that's why I'm interested, I've a rust implementation (need a lot of test and validations) of the eddsa protocol over the babyjubjub curve based on the work of ethsnark people https://github.com/HarryR/ethsnarks/blob/master/ethsnarks/eddsa.py. If the curve and its arithmetics operations are friendly to bulletproofs (the (scalar,Point) product  ) I will more than happy to *try* to impement the verification of a signature for bulletproof. The thing is that I don't want to try to implement it and in the end come out with a proof that took like 10 minutes to be produced or verified. because eddsa is really heavy in terms of arithmetic gates. So the question is: It is heavy for bulletproof do elliptic curve arithmetic?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 03:32:30 GMT):<br/>
Yes it is 
</p>
<p><strong>madiazp</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 03:32:59 GMT):<br/>
nice! thanks, I'll try to do my best
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 03:33:50 GMT):<br/>
What’s the use case? Do you have to apply it? Curve25519 is friendly young bulletproofs
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 03:34:08 GMT):<br/>
Ursa has implemented Bulletproofs over BLS12-381
</p>
<p><strong>madiazp</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 03:40:57 GMT):<br/>
Yeah but I don't only need a signature proof, I need to proof that someone has a valid pubkey and valid signature of public message (both wotness), proof that the hash of say public key belongs to a merkle tree by match a public merkle root with the array of path (all the path are witness), and proof that the hash of that signatures is a valid nullifier (in order to "burn" the credential once the proof is published)
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>madiazp</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 03:46:20 GMT):<br/>
So I have to combine all those constrains in a single proof, that's why I can't use only a signature proof
</p>
<p><strong>madiazp</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 03:52:46 GMT):<br/>
So of all curves which would you say is the most efficient(ish) in bulletproofs?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 01 Jul 2020 04:01:30 GMT):<br/>
Curve25519 for now but zcash just came up with two new curves tweedledum and tweedledee

I am self-taught in various programming languages and hardware development tools. With the need to learn more about blockchain technology, I want to contribute to the URSA project. As I am relatively new to blockchain technology, I find that the best way to learn new topics is by diving in and doing as much work as possible. If there is anything I can do to help you all with strategy management and project management, please let me know. I want to contribute as much as possible. May it be project management or brief blockchain research, I want to help.

Big thanks all who joined the call. I feel slightly contrite that I didn't present in a more fluent and didn't articulate many concepts very clearly and drag some of you for too long (haha). I shall be better next time (if there is one) and trial run myself before. 
In any case, feel free to ping me for further clarification or follow up questions. thanks :blush:

Hi all! :)
</p>
<p><strong>Madhava 16</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 04:21:45 GMT):<br/>
I am looking at doing some Ares stuff and wanted to know about integrating the ursa rust code base into our rust code.
</p>
<p><strong>Madhava 16</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 04:27:19 GMT):<br/>
I am just trying to understand the layers of indirection starting with this:
https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python
it seems it utilises this:
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk
which in turn depends on ursa and other packages
</p>
<p><strong>Madhava 16</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 04:28:22 GMT):<br/>
To ensure we can implement some kind of SSI / DIDComm in our code, would the indy-sdk make the most sense? Or do we need to implement stuff inside ursa directly?
</p>
<p><strong>PatrikStas</strong> (Fri, 17 Jul 2020 10:56:15 GMT):<br/>
@Madhava 16 yes IndySDK is the right place to build on top of. Especially if you working in rust. You might also find useful some of the code inside libvcx https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/tree/master/vcx/libvcx as that's basically rust implementation of Aries / didcomm, but beware there's lots of legacy non-didcomm non-aries code in it.

I have found ursa docs repository https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa-docs and there it is mentioned that ursa has an mdbook, though I can't find a link to it. Can someone give me the link?

Also what is the best place to read ursa documentation is it https://docs.rs/ursa/0.3.4/ursa/ ?
</p>
<p><strong>eadventurous</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 15:54:09 GMT):<br/>
A bit more code specific question: why is `ursa::signatures::SignatureScheme` only implemented for ed25519 and secp256k1 but not for bls or cl?
</p>
<p><strong>eadventurous</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 15:54:58 GMT):<br/>
I thought this trait was used to abstract away the actual algorithm, so it would be logical to implement it for all of the algorithms
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 20:40:52 GMT):<br/>
We’ll add it for BLS, however BLS and CL are more advanced signatures
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 20:41:20 GMT):<br/>
BLS supports aggregation and two variants of the schemes
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 29 Jul 2020 20:41:41 GMT):<br/>
CL is largely for ZKP based signatures

Hi @MALodder did you got feedback regarding the release?
</p>
<p><strong>S3bb1</strong> (Wed, 12 Aug 2020 05:43:39 GMT):<br/>
Hi all, we're currently using ursa for ZKP Credentials and faced that the prime number generation is rather "slow" (also with the native openssl compilation) and takes from 10s to 1m 30s. There is the constant

pub const LARGE_PRIME: usize = 1024;

When setting this const to a lower one (e.g. 512 or 128) it gets faster (like normal because of shorter prime numbers). My question is, are these lower numbers still save and secure? Or which constant value you prefer
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 12 Aug 2020 08:08:10 GMT):<br/>
If I'm not mistaken, this parameter chooses the prime size for the two primes used to generate the RSA modulus.  I don't think anyone would recommend using less than a 2048 bit modulus for RSA, so I wouldn't touch those parameters.

</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Aug 2020 17:49:55 GMT):<br/>
This is because it has to be safe primes which is much slower than just primes
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 12 Aug 2020 17:50:16 GMT):<br/>
as soon as the next PR is merged then I can cut the release

Hi ursa community. I try to play with C API and find https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa#libursa-documentation
libursa C API documentation link go to rust source folders still. Did I go to a wrong way?

Hi All , can anyone please share some inputs and reference repo links on how to implement ZK-SNARK in Indy thru Ursa? just wondering if this has been achieved before in any Indy project?

The problem with snarks is which system to use? use? Spartan, Halo, Hyrax, Libra, Sonic, Plonk, Marlin… Each one has tradeoffs between trusted setups, proof size, bilinear pairings or other elliptic curves, proof generation and generation time. SNARKS are not the only circuit based systems that can be used. Bulletproofs, Bulletproofs+, STARKS, SNARGS… the list goes on but there is no clear winner

@MALodder is there any example repo to refer on implementation on bulletproofs in ursa? can we achieve the same functionality using bulletproofs which we achieve by zk-snark?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 12:38:10 GMT):<br/>
It depends on what you are trying to do with snarks. What’s the use case?
</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 12:57:11 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder my use case is to share certified data in anonymous mode where he/she does not wish to share all the data. For example, if the prover does not wish to share his salary however can answer to the query if salary is higher than the required amount that would solve the verifier’s purpose
</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 12:58:01 GMT):<br/>
or just to prove that user hold the signature without revealing the actual signature
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 13:03:40 GMT):<br/>
We have the BBS signature for withholding the actual signature 
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 13:04:03 GMT):<br/>
Bulletproofs are perfect for range proofs
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 13:04:15 GMT):<br/>
Smaller and faster than snarks for that

@MALodder so do you mean that Zk-snarks implementation is not supported in URSA?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 14:57:14 GMT):<br/>
we haven't implemented any SNARKs in ursa
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 14:57:19 GMT):<br/>
so no
</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 14:59:56 GMT):<br/>
okay, so to achieve ZKP using URSA in Indy we can either use any of these Bulletproofs or BBS approach....right?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:00:48 GMT):<br/>
absolutely
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:01:01 GMT):<br/>
people are too quick to reach for SNARKs when they shouldn't be
</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:04:11 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder okay, understood.. but is there any project on indy which has already used these method of  BBS or Bulletproof using URSA?
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:16:11 GMT):<br/>
yes there are
</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:17:23 GMT):<br/>
could you please give some reference of same, so that i can explore
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:19:29 GMT):<br/>
Trinsic, MattrGlobal, Evernym are companies using them

</p>
<p><strong>avi23</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 15:53:53 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder thank you,  it would be great if you can share any GitHub repo for any of these projects who successfully implemented these

<p><strong>tomislav</strong> (Wed, 26 Aug 2020 17:46:37 GMT):<br/>
Sure. I'm only aware of BBS implementations.
An early version of BBS for JSON-LD can be found here:

BBS for JSON-LD in .NET https://github.com/streetcred-id/ld-proofs-dotnet
This is based on a BBS FFI wrapper now maintained at https://github.com/mattrglobal/ffi-bbs-signatures/. There are available wrappers for .NET and C, with Java coming in.

For NodeJS environment, BBS sigs for JSON-LD
https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs

For example usage, I can point you to the unit tests in each repo, to see how these are used with practical LD documents

<p><strong>AryamaI</strong> (Tue, 15 Sep 2020 10:24:40 GMT):<br/>
Hello Everyone,  I am trying to understand briefly how User/holder anonymity is maintained at the time of credential verification.  I see that holder's wallet data is encrypted by a master key. So, is there any api that allows a user to know his wallet master key? As a response to the proof of request, I see a master_secret value in the API Response sent by the holder, what is it.?In the AliceFaber example I see that some attribute values are revealed like name, degree at the point of verification. Only the age is kept hidden based on the predicate. So, cant we ensure a complete anonymity by even hiding the other fields. So, how does user anonymity works in here and similarly , what is the prurpose of master key used for encrypting the wallet, in brief?  Kindly help me understand these points. Any help is appreciated, thank you.

Also, from my understanding, all encryption works internally work using URSA, but do we still need to do any extra enablement when running the ALiceFaberDemo for master key or anything? I haven't done anything differently. So, how does user anonymity works in here, and similarly, what is the purpose of the master key used for encrypting the wallet, in brief?  Kindly help me understand these points. Any help is appreciated, thank you.

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 17:12:43 GMT):<br/>
I'd like to check my intuitive understanding of some of snark concepts so I'm going to try to use plain english rather than parroting technical terms. We want to show that we can create these proofs for general programs/algorithms. Consequently papers often started with binary circuits as those directly reflect what you can make with an electronic circuit, and because we are dealing in just individual bits, the proofs of correctness for the systems are easier to write. Dealing with individual bits is inefficient though so once you've shown the properties you want hold in a binary circuit it's good to show they hold in an arithmetic circuit (i.e. now I'm working with bigints instead of bits). Even that is not a super efficient way to encode statements so that gave rise to other constructions like QSPs and QAPs with the current state of the art focused on R1CS. I'll pause here before maybe digging into r1cs.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 19:55:29 GMT):<br/>
Are you comfortable with circuit definitions?  People like to use arithmetic circuits (and things that are built on them, like QAPs) because they are closer to cryptographic assumptions in that they work over large fields.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 20:19:43 GMT):<br/>
I think I am, but probably don't know what I should be uncomfortable about in my knowledge :) 
I know what 3-sat is, and that an arithmetic circuit just lets you apply normal operations at each gate. The examples for snarky things generally use multiplication at each gate and collapse additions in to those multiplications.. possibly because their group operation is multiplication?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 20:23:07 GMT):<br/>
Arithmetic circuits are defined over finite fields, with ADD gates and MULTIPLY gates.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 20:23:23 GMT):<br/>
Is that what you meant by "normal" operations?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 20:23:32 GMT):<br/>
yeah
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 20:24:47 GMT):<br/>
Many of the ZK things use pairings.  Group multiplication == addition in the exponent, group exponentiation == multiplication in the exponent.  To multiply in the exponent you need pairings.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 20:24:48 GMT):<br/>
I guess instead of AND and OR in boolean circuits (with binary inputs) you have ADD and MULT (with finite field inputs).
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 20:24:53 GMT):<br/>
That's correct.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 20:45:07 GMT):<br/>
Ok thanks. I set that up like I was going to go across the breadth of the snarks concept, but really just dialing into this encoding thing to go from circuits to r1cs before I try to dig some more on r1cs. 
At the moment I'm on an excursion into FHE and reading some of the Gentry stuff from 2009/2010.. the application of circuits there brought my mind back to their use in Snarks and this progression towards r1cs.

What's gotten you into FHE?  I would read the GSW paper if you want to understand FHE:  https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/340
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 20:46:40 GMT):<br/>
It's much easier to understand why and how it works than with the earlier schemes, which need rings, modulus switching, or other complicated techniques.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 20:50:11 GMT):<br/>
Someone wanted to assert that FHE did things that TEEs do and ... anyway there's some productive stuff with FHE so I'm trying to get a visceral sense of it. I started with the jewelry paper which is hilarious and accessible. I'm reading the FHE over the Integers 2010 paper right now. I wasn't aware of the GSW paper but thought this integers paper had a similar purpose... like you're probably not going to make this integer based system, but look how easy it is to understand! ;)

I'm so underqualified to make any judgements, but it seems like using crazy big numbers to hide one bit and then a lot of corner case coverage to manage the cumulative noise.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 20:51:42 GMT):<br/>
TEEs give you essentially VBB (virtual black-box obfuscation).  FHE doesn't allow you to learn anything about the message encrypted in the ciphertext, which you really want to allow (selectively) for most TEE applications.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 20:51:59 GMT):<br/>
Most people really want functional encryption when they mention FHE.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 20:52:18 GMT):<br/>
Yeah, FHE schemes are very inefficient right now.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 22 Sep 2020 20:52:40 GMT):<br/>
The GSW paper is currently (I think) the simplest and cleanest construction.

I'm a little confused with the README.md about how to use those compiled artifact(s)

Hi, I like to use Zero Knowledge proof capabilities with either Sawtooth or Iroha. Is it possible to do this with Ursa. I noticed that Iroha has already an option to install Libursa, but no mention on Libzmix. On Sawtooth I only read some old emails that there is an intention, but no concrete recent info.
</p>
<p><strong>tosirisuk</strong> (Mon, 19 Oct 2020 05:12:42 GMT):<br/>
I have this issue on this too. I spent about two weeks trying to find the way to use the `libzmix`, but no success yet.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 19 Oct 2020 14:06:27 GMT):<br/>
libzmix is just a library like libursa
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 19 Oct 2020 14:07:02 GMT):<br/>
We are in the middle of migrating an FFI layer into zmix from an external project that will allow you to do this
</p>

Thanks for the information @MALodder. I'm just new to Rust and right know I don't quite understand how to use those compiled in my Rust project.

libursa.so (Linux)
libursa.dylib (Mac OS X)
libursa.a (Linux, Mac OS X)
libursa.dll (Windows)
libursa.lib (Windows)
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Mon, 19 Oct 2020 14:56:50 GMT):<br/>
you just need the dynamic library portion
</p>
<p><strong>tosirisuk</strong> (Mon, 19 Oct 2020 14:57:59 GMT):<br/>
OK, will google for more detail on "dynamic library". Appreciate your guide

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Mon, 19 Oct 2020 16:06:04 GMT):<br/>
When we talked about GS proofs a while back, modules came up. There was an observation about their relation to vector spaces (which is maybe only important to you if you are close to linear algebra). As I look at lattices, I want to connect these three. While there are different aspects you could look at across these structures, one progression is that the elements of each move from
fields  ->  rings  ->  integers 
for 
vector spaces -> modules -> and lattices respectively. 
Also it's correct to think of a Lattice as a kind of Module and a Module as a kind of Vector space. 

Please disagree with me if you see errors here.
</p>
<p><strong>duuren</strong> (Tue, 20 Oct 2020 21:39:06 GMT):<br/>
Thanks, looking forward.
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 19:48:24 GMT):<br/>
did you ever find out?  I think a module is a generalization of a vector space like a vector space can be a generalization of an operation over a field but I could be wrong.  Been a long time since I wore a mathematician hat.  Am curious to learn what the answers to the other things you mentioned here were though.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 21:55:04 GMT):<br/>
no one argued with me so that means I'm certainly correct ;)
Seriously, though, i think those definitions are correct. I just hadn't seen them side by side before so I wanted to double check.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 22 Oct 2020 21:56:10 GMT):<br/>
There's a 'category' sort of relationship there that interests me though. And I use category loosely.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 23 Oct 2020 00:07:10 GMT):<br/>
Module is to ring as vector space is to field is the appropriate analogy.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 23 Oct 2020 00:07:25 GMT):<br/>
And yes, category theory is a whole field!

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 23 Oct 2020 18:47:44 GMT):<br/>
So according to GPV and I read this somewhere else too tho I don't remember where now, for the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalized basis, each vector is "clearly" less than or equal to the original basis vector. And I'm fine with that, but I also read that Det(L) doesn't depend on choice of basis. But if you can have a basis with some shorter vectors wouldn't that imply a smaller volume?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 23 Oct 2020 18:52:35 GMT):<br/>
No!  This would be easier to explain if I could draw.  But think about the following:   I could have a square with side length 1 ( and thus with area 1), or a parallelepiped defined by the vectors (1, 0) and (10, 1).  This parallelepiped also has area 1, even though its sides are much longer (draw this out if this isn't clear).  This is basically what's going on here, although in high dimension.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 23 Oct 2020 18:53:23 GMT):<br/>
Note that the lattice spanned by the vectors (1, 0) and (0, 1) is the same as that spanned by (1, 0) and (20, 1).
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 23 Oct 2020 18:53:56 GMT):<br/>
The determinant is dependent on the lattice and independent of the basis.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 23 Oct 2020 18:55:12 GMT):<br/>
ohhhh. got it....
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 23 Oct 2020 18:56:31 GMT):<br/>
I think with even smaller numbers if I have {(1,0), (1,1)} the orthoganalized basis would be ({1,0}, {0,1}} and the former is a parallelogram with area 1 and the latter is a square with area 1.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 23 Oct 2020 18:56:47 GMT):<br/>
(tho usually when I try to do math quickly I mess something up)
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 23 Oct 2020 18:56:58 GMT):<br/>
(also happens when I take a lot of time)
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 23 Oct 2020 18:58:12 GMT):<br/>
Yep, that's right!
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 23 Oct 2020 18:58:37 GMT):<br/>
thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 23 Oct 2020 18:59:28 GMT):<br/>
What I have said is a little bit of an oversimplification of what's going on in high dimensions (and of the GS basis), but it's good for intuition.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 23 Oct 2020 19:02:04 GMT):<br/>
works for me. and seems to work just fine in low dimension .. more so than seeing intuitively the difficulty in finding the distance between a perturbed point and a lattice point.
tho even there I now think of looking at the projection of a 3D point on a 2D drawing. The point will look close to a 'foreground' vertex just because of the projection.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 23 Oct 2020 19:04:03 GMT):<br/>
This "projecting to the GS basis" idea for lattice reduction has a name:  Babai's nearest plane algorithm.
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Mon, 26 Oct 2020 20:56:41 GMT):<br/>
Lattice Based system is NP hard because of Super Increasing Subset Sum Problem applied on coefficients of vectors.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 26 Oct 2020 21:29:19 GMT):<br/>
Lattice-based cryptosystems are not NP-hard themselves.  Crypto problems themselves generally have to be in NP intersect coNP, and it is considered to be unlikely that NP = NP intersect coNP.   Lattice problems are, however, generally based on finding approximate solutions of problems for which finding exact solutions are NP-hard (e.g. SVP or CVP).
</p>
<p><strong>ashutosh_kumar</strong> (Mon, 26 Oct 2020 22:49:17 GMT):<br/>
The basic idea is solving Zero Sum Problem.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 27 Oct 2020 01:17:21 GMT):<br/>
Lattice problems are actually quite a bit different from subset sum problems (which are only hard for a relatively narrow band of parameters).
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 27 Oct 2020 01:17:40 GMT):<br/>
Here are some slides that explain some of the hardness connections on lattices pretty well:  https://www.iacr.org/workshops/tcc2007/Micciancio.pdf

Still, If someone can redirect me to any handy blog articles , it would be great !! Usage is bit hard to understand . Any leads are appreciated !!

Hi all, i want to collect some feedback regarding "public Proofs". For example a user wants to show the outside world, that he has a specific claim (CL VC). Our approach would be creating a Presentation/Proof of this Credential and putting the data to a public website (where it can be checked). Since CL also requires a proof request beforehand, this must also be put public. Is this a valid approach or is there an easier/smarter way to have a "public proof" on a website for a specific credential

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 21:42:10 GMT):<br/>
Does signature malleability demonstrate existential forgery?
I.e. if a paper formally claims to be secure against existential forgery, but it is possible to mutate a signature and still have it verify with the same key, does that demonstrate a flaw?
Or must you contrive a signature for a *different* message?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 21:55:29 GMT):<br/>
@Dan You have to forge a signature for a *different* message.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 21:55:52 GMT):<br/>
You can have non-malleable signatures, though, which have the property that you state.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 21:56:29 GMT):<br/>
Even stronger, there are unique signatures, where for each message there only exists one possible signature.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 21:57:34 GMT):<br/>
As an example of a signature scheme that is secure but trivially malleable, consider some existing signature scheme (KeyGen, Sign, Verify) with the usual form.  We can construct a silly scheme in the following way:
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 21:57:47 GMT):<br/>
KeyGen' := Keygen
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 21:58:03 GMT):<br/>
Sign' = Sign(sk, m) || 1
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 21:58:28 GMT):<br/>
Verify' = Verify( sigma \ last bit, vk)
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 21:58:30 GMT):<br/>
where sigma \
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 21:58:30 GMT):<br/>
where sigma \ last bit means delete the last bit from sigma.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 02 Dec 2020 21:59:44 GMT):<br/>
Note flipping the last bit in each signature still constitutes a valid signature, which means we also have malleability.  But breaking the 'prime' scheme implies breaking the original signature scheme if you generate a signature on an unqueried message.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 00:28:46 GMT):<br/>
cool. thanks. Another example is flipping the y coord in ecdsa. In the context of how it was used in bitcoin that became a semantic flaw, but I guess that's a consequence of how ecdsa is used in that system and doesn't constitute a formal forgery.
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 00:32:38 GMT):<br/>
why is it a semantic flaw?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 00:34:14 GMT):<br/>
that's not a formal term. I just mean that bitcoin made assumptions that there was only one signature for a given message but because elliptic curves are symmetric you can have two valid signatures (one with a +y and one with a -y).
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 00:39:04 GMT):<br/>
Coming back to existential forgery...
In most systems you have some sort of hash_to_group function where you take the message and squish it into a point.
If I can produce a valid signature for the same key but modifying the hash result does that count? Or must it be a change to the plain text message / know the preimage.
i.e. 
verify(p=hash(m), sig, pk)
verify(p'=hash(m)+1, sig, pk)
does that count or must I modify m directly?
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 00:39:04 GMT):<br/>
Coming back to existential forgery...
In most systems you have some sort of hash_to_group function where you take the message and squish it into an element.
If I can produce a valid signature for the same key but modifying the hash result does that count? Or must it be a change to the plain text message / know the preimage.
i.e. 
verify(p=hash(m), sig, pk)
verify(p'=hash(m)+1, sig, pk)

</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 00:54:42 GMT):<br/>
The hash is deterministic.  So if you can find two messages m, m' such that H(m) = H(m'), then you're breaking the collision resistance of the hash.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 00:56:37 GMT):<br/>
No, you need to modify m directly.  Remember that, to win the game, you need to provide a pair (m, \sigma) such that Verify(m, \sigma, vk) = 1.  So you have to modify m directly.  You can also think about the practical ramifications of this definition.  What good is the second verify equation you presented above?  No one will accept it as a valid signature, so it's not a good forgery.
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Thu, 03 Dec 2020 03:02:36 GMT):<br/>
Fair enough. Thanks. :)
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 04 Dec 2020 21:26:17 GMT):<br/>
@MALodder I'm in the middle of doing the k256 library change. I don't remember why we have this rustlibsecp256k1 feature defined here:
https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/blob/master/libursa/src/lib.rs#L84-L85
as opposed to just relying on `feature = "ecdsa_secp256k1"` 
I think the latter is the main feature exposure, i.e. we have 3 flavors:
ecdsa_secp256k1 (pure rust); ecdsa_secp256k1_native (bitcoin lib); and ecdsa_secp256k1_asm (bitcoin lib);
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 04 Dec 2020 21:45:31 GMT):<br/>
It’s there for rust only features 
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 04 Dec 2020 21:59:52 GMT):<br/>
ok, I thought ecdsa_secp256k1 is (a/the?) feature definition for rust only
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 04 Dec 2020 22:04:49 GMT):<br/>
I don't understand how these are different
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 04 Dec 2020 22:21:20 GMT):<br/>
Question #2... This seems like it should be a build-time error:
https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/blob/master/libursa/src/signatures/secp256k1.rs#L198
As far as I can tell that should be 
`libsecp256k1::key::PublicKey`
The bitcoin library does not list `PublicKey` as a top level object.

They have an example with the appearance of a higher level struct but the actual code has to import the `key` module.
is there any chance we aren't building this in CI? I mean I know this is 99% probability I'm just missing some language thing but I thought I'd ask before spending an hour side track in to the build.

<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Mon, 07 Dec 2020 14:30:49 GMT):<br/>
Sorry I guess I'm not asking clearly, but it's also probably not super important.. there's two 'features' we have that are both labeled for pure rust, i.e. they both use the same rust lib, not the rust-wrapping of the bitcoin lib. If you recall why lemme know.

Given digitally signed messages m_i with public keys p_i. Can I prove that the sum is M  = Sum_i m_i without disclosing the individual messages? What digital signature schemes and cryptographic primitives would be suitable for this use case? Any pointers?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Sat, 09 Jan 2021 00:36:13 GMT):<br/>
You can do this with general purpose SNARKs (or, more generally, general purpose ZK proofs).

In some of the papers that have been posted here and in the meetings they describe their security proofs as "proof by simulation".  I think I get the gist of it from the proofs that have been presented in the papers, but is there a more coherent and full write up on the topic of security proof "by simulation"?  ex) https://www.orbs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Crypto_Group_signatures-2.pdf uses this technique

Hi Everyone, we at Fujitsu Laboratories are planning to develop a Zero Knowledge Framework where application developers can easily switch among various zero knowledge libraries. I can talk in a bit more details in tomorrow's meeting, but we would like to get Ursa communities feedback and if this is something that you think would be helpful for everybody. Please note, zk-interface by QED-it attains some of the broad goals that we want to achieve https://github.com/QED-it/zkinterface , but it is not exactly user friendly.

<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:33:54 GMT):<br/>
we should consider this for ursa https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-komlo-frost/?include_text=1
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 28 Jan 2021 17:34:35 GMT):<br/>
Yeah.  Definitely worth considering.
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 29 Jan 2021 20:19:57 GMT):<br/>
found someone maintaining pairing-plus in a fork called paired
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 29 Jan 2021 20:20:11 GMT):<br/>
so if we use that then we don't need to maintain a fork in ursa
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Fri, 29 Jan 2021 20:37:50 GMT):<br/>
unfortunately it requires modifying some stuff
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Sat, 30 Jan 2021 00:18:07 GMT):<br/>
Can you link the fork?

Howdy - step one to move [main repo Ursa CI](https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/pull/173) from AZP to GHA. I noticed on both, the test step runs 0 tests - is that by design?

<p><strong>eadventurous</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 12:36:57 GMT):<br/>
Just curious was there any research done into post-quantum cryptography and are there any plans to implement it?
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 13:30:39 GMT):<br/>
I think there was a discussion about that on the call yesterday if you listen to that recording.  There has been work done but that's as far as my understanding goes.
</p>
<p><strong>eadventurous</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 14:22:18 GMT):<br/>
@daidoji can you send me a link to the recordings? I found the agenda of the meetings but no recordings yet...
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 14:24:26 GMT):<br/>
oh I'm sorry, I guess we weren't recording.  Sorry.  Hopefully someone else will be able to help you in here.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 14:55:41 GMT):<br/>
I have the recording but need to upload it (zoom takes forever to process it, so it's not uncommon for me to forget, unfortunately).
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 14:56:27 GMT):<br/>
What kind of post-quantum crypto are you interested in?  I can probably just answer your questions here rather than you having to listen to an entire meeting.  We also didn't talk about general post-quantum strategy in the meeting, either.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 14:57:21 GMT):<br/>
We do have a plan to implement basic post-quantum crypto (i.e. signatures and key exchange/basic encryption).  So far, no one is really interested in using it though, so we haven't progressed too far.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 14:57:43 GMT):<br/>
If you're interested in post-quantum ZK and stuff like that, then it gets much more complicated.
</p>
<p><strong>eadventurous</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 15:03:03 GMT):<br/>
I am from Hyperledger Iroha team and we are potentially interested in quantum resistant cryptography (public key signatures and encryption algorithms). But it is a long term goal though we were thinking to propose a its research and MVP integration as an internship. And naturally as we are using ursa, we wanted to check at first if you support it already.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 15:06:43 GMT):<br/>
We're definitely planning on supporting those.  We are also waiting on the NIST post-quantum competition to wrap up, as our implementations will likely be based on whatever wins that.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 15:06:58 GMT):<br/>
That should be later this year.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 15:07:05 GMT):<br/>
What's your timeline for needing post-quantum crypto?
</p>
<p><strong>eadventurous</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 15:19:11 GMT):<br/>
We don't have any specific date for this yet, I think if ursa will support it by the end of this year or beginning of the next, this will suit us.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 15:20:15 GMT):<br/>
Great.  Are you following the NIST competition?  We're planning on really diving into it once that wraps up.  At that point, it makes sense to really spend some time on it (and we'd be happy to have your participation).
</p>
<p><strong>eadventurous</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 15:35:27 GMT):<br/>
Thank you for the suggestion! Yes, we will try to follow. Sure we will be happy to contribute to Ursa if our priorities will allow that, when the development starts.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 15:36:00 GMT):<br/>
Even if you don't have time or resources to contribute, it'd still be useful to hear your requirements and how you want to use post-quantum crypto.  So definitely stay in touch!
</p>
<p><strong>eadventurous</strong> (Thu, 18 Feb 2021 16:38:11 GMT):<br/>

<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Wed, 10 Mar 2021 13:26:11 GMT):<br/>
Oh wow, so those "sigils" from the scifi novel Daemon are possible?  That's awesome.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 10 Mar 2021 17:17:24 GMT):<br/>
I have not read that novel.  But fuzzy crypto is essential for things like biometrics.
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Wed, 10 Mar 2021 18:08:08 GMT):<br/>
Oh its a "cool ideas" scifi novel.  

In the novel various agents of the antagonist (which was a giant AI decentralized social network thing) produced "sigils" to prove that they really were working for the giant AI decentralized network.  

I'm not gonna do it justice but they were like cryptographically signed images that humans could also recreate and verify.

So like human being traces some pattern in the air -> generates signed sigil.  Other humans could look at a sigil and see if it was valid or not (but also in the background software the AI network gave the human agents would verify it cryptographically).
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Wed, 10 Mar 2021 18:08:43 GMT):<br/>
I thought was a cool idea, but had no way to go about it
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 10 Mar 2021 18:54:27 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure we'll ever be able to have human verifiable cryptography, unfortunately.
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Wed, 10 Mar 2021 19:10:59 GMT):<br/>
unfortunately, but human eyes are pretty good at spotting differences that aren't pathological
</p>
<p><strong>daidoji</strong> (Wed, 10 Mar 2021 19:11:03 GMT):<br/>
still thought it was a cool idae

When you put:
>The first iteration of this infrastructure was slow, did not scale, was overly simplistic in some ways and wildly over-complicated in other ways and therefore prevented the ADE from being possible.

and link to the ToIP RFC  what parts did you think were too simple and which parts did you think were far too complex in particular?

Just came across this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol
Which reminded me of the protocol that @MALodder showed a few weeks back.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Tue, 23 Mar 2021 22:24:11 GMT):<br/>
The protocols Mike described are a bit orthogonal to PAKEs, but for a similar application.  ZK authentication is pretty neat, though, and I'd love to see it in practice.
</p>
<p><strong>lmtriet</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 13:12:28 GMT):<br/>
Hi, just curious, what is the protocol you are talking about ? I've heard of OPAQUE but it is still a PAKE.
</p>
<p><strong>lmtriet</strong> (Wed, 24 Mar 2021 19:48:17 GMT):<br/>
I have read the Groth signature implementation in libzmix (groth_sig.rs) and there is a part in the code that does not follow the paper which might lead to signature forgery. It is OK you to discuss it here ? Please let me know. Thanks.

Hello! I couldn't compile ursa project from source, whnever I try I'm getting seg fault and no descriptive reason why it is happening. So my question is have anyone encounter this error before and know how to solve it?

iirc the cargo files are in a weird state.. we turned things off to restructure the repo and are half-way through the restructuring. To get things to build you have to do some fiddling in the cargo files. Sorry that is very hand-wavey. Probably time for us to fix that.

Is there a set of standardized claims that are relevant to aries? I'm not sure if it would be a self-sovereign ID thing or something else. I'm looking at JWT right now for example: https://www.iana.org/assignments/jwt/jwt.xhtml
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Thu, 22 Apr 2021 20:27:10 GMT):<br/>
Not at the Aries level as it is up to Issuers to decide what they want to issue and verifiers on what they are will to accept (what claims from what issuers).
</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong> (Fri, 23 Apr 2021 17:30:38 GMT):<br/>
thanks @swcurran! Is there a standardized claim format? and/or is there something formalized with claims in DID or dependency of DID (I haven't had the opportunity to go deep on DIDs but I did poke around for claims and didn't see formalizations in the core spec).
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 23 Apr 2021 20:48:34 GMT):<br/>
@swcurran Are there recommended/popular specifications?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Fri, 23 Apr 2021 23:03:36 GMT):<br/>
Claims are put into verifiable credentials.  There is a standard for verifiable credentials from the W3C, and Indy AnonCreds has a format that pre-dates the W3C standard.  There is not a DID dependency on VCs, VCs are tied to a signature scheme, the keys for which might come from DIDs.  VCs hold an arbitrary bucket of claims and can be used for anything.

At the Aries level, there are no recommended specs. for credentials or claims.  That happens at a higher level in the trust over IP stack and relates to the ecosystem.

One of the fun parts (AFAIK) in the use of JWTs to hold the VCs is that JWTs have those preset list of claims.  But I'm not deep on JWTs and VCs, as my experience is mostly with Indy credentials and a little bit (but gaining) on JSON-LD.

Is that getting towards the answers to what you are asking?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Fri, 23 Apr 2021 23:15:00 GMT):<br/>

@MALodder would you be willing to publish a new release - `v0.3.6` - to resolve https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/issues/178 ? I notice there are more releases on crates.io than on GitHub, as well
</p>
<p><strong>rjones</strong> (Wed, 28 Apr 2021 22:10:50 GMT):<br/>
@hartm Sorry I missed today's call. Looking at the open PRs and issues, I think a lot of weeding could happen - what do the maintainers think about closing the outstanding PRs and doing a pass over the open issues to triage them?

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 28 Apr 2021 22:58:30 GMT):<br/>
There is definitely some refactoring work that needs to be done.

Hi, I've seen this paper (https://github.com/cryptosubtlety/zero/blob/main/0.pdf) in the BLS Signature RFC, it seems to me that in general the attack model does not apply to Hyperledger Indy, because only nodes generate keys and signatures and they are kind of trustworthy + public keys can be checked against null. I've also seen in the bls.rs comments that the  rogue public key attack was considered as a seperate function, are the other zero attacks considered or relevant at all?

Hi, I am new to this forum, but not new to Indy from (had our company become a Sovrin steward several years ago). I'm just not starting to dig into the details of BBS+ and have a couple questions that if someone could point me to someone that might be willing to help, that would be appreciated. 

First, BBS+ is noted as based on BLS12381G1_XMD:BLAKE2B_SSWU_RO_,  but line 243 of the following indicates that it is using SH-256 not BLAKE2B. Can someone confirm which hash is being used, given the comment in the source? And if the comments are incorrect and blake2b is being used, is it blake2b512 (which produces 64 bytes)?
https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/blob/main/libzmix/bbs/src/keys.rs

Second, the messages in the test are passed through a hash. Is this using sha256 or blake2b. And if blake2b, is it blake2b512 (which produces 64bytes)?
https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/blob/main/libzmix/bbs/tests/bbs.rs
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 04:27:42 GMT):<br/>
I believe that first comment you linked to is incorrect (or outdated), the method is using hash_to_g1: https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/blob/526fcaa39b41cfc8d3f2aa6acd0c85e430ba5c34/libzmix/bbs/src/lib.rs#L310
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 04:29:41 GMT):<br/>
It’s more complicated than just using blake2 though, it’s an instantiation of the hash-to-curve algorithm with blake2 as the hash parameter, producing elements of the G1 group

</p>
<p><strong>chris.matichuk</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 04:30:28 GMT):<br/>
Ok. And is it blake2b512 (which produces a 64byte hash)? Asking because I'm modifying a version of expand_message_xmd that uses sha256...which uses a 32byte hash.
</p>
<p><strong>chris.matichuk</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 04:31:02 GMT):<br/>
I'm working on a C version of this.
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 04:33:31 GMT):<br/>
Looks like it’s 64 bytes, expanding the FixedOutputDirty trait here https://docs.rs/blake2/0.9.1/blake2/struct.Blake2b.html
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 04:36:25 GMT):<br/>
The spec here also specifies 512 bits: https://mattrglobal.github.io/bbs-signatures-spec/
</p>
<p><strong>chris.matichuk</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 04:36:57 GMT):<br/>
Ahh...yes it does.
</p>
<p><strong>chris.matichuk</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 04:42:58 GMT):<br/>
A separate observation. Based on ursa, it appears w in calculating h0...hn should be in serialized form (192 bytes) - the spec doesn't indicate that. Or am I miss-reading something there?
</p>
<p><strong>andrew.whitehead</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 05:06:29 GMT):<br/>
Looks like it is the 192 byte uncompressed form, and it doesn’t seem clear to me in the spec either because it’s just concatenating a point to some bytes 
</p>
<p><strong>chris.matichuk</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 05:08:39 GMT):<br/>
Spec should say point_to_octets_norm(w) or something.
</p>
<p><strong>chris.matichuk</strong> (Fri, 07 May 2021 05:29:50 GMT):<br/>
And "C1 = e(A, w * P2 ^ e)" should be changed to "C1 = e(A, w+P2*e)" - at least that is what I ended up doing to get the verify to work.
</p>

In the CL verifier implementation the implementation currently only returns a boolean. As a user I might be interested which attribute (group) / sub proof fails or if it fails because of the primary proof or the non revocation proof. Is there a particular reason why there is not a more expressive/richer output or could we add this?

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 19 May 2021 20:34:39 GMT):<br/>
Depending on the application, it might violate a user's privacy if verification reveals which particular thing failed.  Revealing too much information about failures has been a notable leakage channel and has been used in cryptanalysis some, so in general the best practice is considered to give as little information about failures as possible.
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 14:13:14 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for your comment. I was thinking that these proofs might not be totally independent and if there's a failure in one subproof I can't really verify the others, but if these proofs are independently verifiable I wouldn't agree that we should bet on "privacy by non-implementation". In addition the user decided to share this proof before, so I think in many cases the further interaction between verifier and prover would benefit if the verifier could pin point the reason for failure and communicate this to the prover.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 14:16:42 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure I agree with this.  In a good world, proofs should fail for technical reasons extremely rarely.  As a user, if, say, I am rejected by a credit algorithm for some purchase, I don't want the verifier to be able to figure out why.  "Privacy by non-implementation" could be just "privacy by not giving out extra unnecessary information" which is one of the main tenets of privacy.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 14:16:45 GMT):<br/>
Does this make sense?
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 14:25:54 GMT):<br/>
I'm just not sure if it helps if one implementation of a verifier does not expose all information contained in a proof. We'd need other cryptographic techniques to achieve this like the user has to calculate the credit algorithm in a zkSnark, such that really only this one bit of information is transferred from prover to verifier.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 14:26:43 GMT):<br/>
Do you mind explaining your use case a little bit?  Perhaps that will help me understand things better.
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 15:15:15 GMT):<br/>
I was wondering in general, based on the following observation :) We are part of a pilot project to implement a digital hotel check-in for business travel. Therefore, you provide a few attributes from a personal ID and a few attributes of  a corporate ID. I just implemented the UI of a virtual test hotel where our pilot users can test the "check-in process" and play around with it. So I wanted to show them for example when they try to check-in with a revoked corporate Id that it fails exactly because of this. And I guess the verifier has this information but its just not exposed through the API.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 15:16:05 GMT):<br/>
Ah, I see.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 15:17:12 GMT):<br/>
The verifier may or may not have that information, though, depending on how you have structured the proof.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 15:18:59 GMT):<br/>
If you want this extra information, is there a reason you are not just using multiple proofs (i.e. one for a corporate ID, one for a user ID) and perhaps a proof to tie them together?  Maybe it's less efficient to do it this way?
</p>
<p><strong>domwoe</strong> (Thu, 20 May 2021 15:24:13 GMT):<br/>
Non-revocation proof is always additive, isn't it? I should always know if only the proof of non revocation fails for a given cred Def. 

This would be more effort for the user.

The way its coded in Ursa, you are not given the reason for the failure. The reason could be an invalid signature, invalid data, revoked credential, bad range proof. If any proof fails, they all do

Hi, I'm was wondering if there are any ursa functions for zero knowledge set completeness? I know there are functions for zero knowledge set membership, ie a proof that element x exists in set {x, y, z}. I'm looking to prove that a presented set is complete, eg if given set {x, y, z} it would return true, but if given {x, y} it would return false because there is an element missing. The context is for credit history, where an individual discloses a set of credit credentials and they want to prove they they haven't left anything out of their record (eg the credential that they defaulted on their loan). Let me know if there's any code that already does this, or if anyone knows of a paper that talks about it. Thanks.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 16:40:27 GMT):<br/>
Can you define "set completeness" more rigorously?  Do you mean "a set must contain elements of type A, B, and C"?  Or "a set must include all elements added to some blockchain with property XYZ"?  It's hard to answer your question without knowing exactly what you mean by set completeness.
</p>
<p><strong>jacobsaur</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 18:45:32 GMT):<br/>
So for my particular use case every element is a verifiable credential, but more generally we could say each element is a string. So just like with cryptographic accumulators you can prove that some string x is in set {x, y, z} without revealing the set before hand, I'd like to prove that a set of strings {x, y, z} isn't missing any elements that should be in it without revealing the set beforehand.

So just like with cryptographic accumulators you can prove that some string x is in set {x, y, z} without revealing the set before hand, I'd like to prove the opposite where is I present {x, y} that I'm not leaving out z from the set (without revealing the set beforehand).

<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 21:47:29 GMT):<br/>
I guess my question then is the following:  how do I know that z has been added to the set (or accumulator) in the first place?  How do I know that z is "supposed to be" in the set?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 21:48:09 GMT):<br/>
How do I know what the set is "supposed to look like?"
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Wed, 26 May 2021 21:48:53 GMT):<br/>
If you define a set in a rigorous way, you may be able to do this.  But you need to define a set as some kind of NP-language.
</p>
<p><strong>jacobsaur</strong> (Thu, 27 May 2021 10:58:18 GMT):<br/>
So maybe it's best if I can describe how I imagine the system to work and then we can figure out how to turn that into formal NP-language. I'll first start with a non-zero knowledge solution. We have an issuer I1 who issues a credential C1 to holder H1. We want this credential to be part of the holder's credit history (ie part of the set) so we also broadcast to a blockchain some data that summarizes what happened (H1->C1). Then let's say a second issuer issues a second credential to the same holder so we broadcast (H1->C2). When H1 wants to have their credit history verified by verifier V1 they can present them credentials in a set {C1, C2}, the verifier can then look at the blockchain and see that H1 should have credentials C1 and C2 in their set and therefore the presented set is complete. The problem with this is that all H1 credentials are public so some snooper verifier V2 could also see that H1 has {C1, C2} without H1 giving V2 permission. Storing the hashes of the credentials would be a bit better, because V1 could be presented {C1, C2} and verify that it matches {hash(C1), hash(C2)} for H1 on the blockchain. That's an improvement, but snooper V2 could still see that something is going on with H1 every time a new hash is added, ie H1 has a new hash added every week and then misses a week V2, could guess that H1 missed a repayment. So I was hoping for a solution something like how credential revocation works with cryptographic accumulators - ie an issuer can revoke a credential and broadcast something to a blockchain in a way that no snooper can tell which credential was revoked or which holder it referred to - it's only when a holder tries to construct a non-revoked proof that the verifier can see that a specific presented credential has been revoked. Is there a way to do that with complete sets, where there's something on the blockchain that issuers can update that would reveal nothing to snoopers, but when a holder goes to present a set, a verifier could set whether the set is complete?
Thanks for all the clarifying questions, I hope I've described it well enough.

You want to be able to prove that a set of credentials contains everything associated with a particular ID (or maybe even something more fine-grained, where  you can filter on more things).
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 27 May 2021 14:11:12 GMT):<br/>
This is possible with powerful cryptographic techniques, but I'm not sure it's going to be efficient at all.  I don't think you can pull this off with what's in Ursa right now, although maybe you can if you have a very weak security model or tolerate a lot of inefficiency (i.e. the verifier has to scan the whole chain).
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 27 May 2021 14:11:20 GMT):<br/>
What kind of efficiency do you need for this?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 27 May 2021 14:11:25 GMT):<br/>
And thanks for the interesting discussion?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 27 May 2021 14:11:25 GMT):<br/>
And thanks for the interesting discussion!
</p>
<p><strong>jacobsaur</strong> (Thu, 27 May 2021 14:17:02 GMT):<br/>
Yes that description sounds right. It doesn't need to be terribly efficient since people are used to credit checks taking awhile, but it should at least be scalable - ie verification times shouldn't get exponentially longer as more transactions get added.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 27 May 2021 14:30:56 GMT):<br/>
What if verification time scales linearly with the number of transactions on the blockchain (i.e. bad, but far from exponential)?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 27 May 2021 14:32:53 GMT):<br/>
What you are looking for seems similar in flavor to ABE:
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 27 May 2021 14:32:57 GMT):<br/>
https://eprint.iacr.org/2006/309.pdf
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 27 May 2021 14:33:24 GMT):<br/>
But an ABE-style solution would probably require verification to examine the whole blockchain.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 27 May 2021 14:36:23 GMT):<br/>
It sounds like what you really want is an "attribute-based accumulator" and to my knowledge, no constant-sized one exists.
</p>
<p><strong>jacobsaur</strong> (Thu, 27 May 2021 14:44:30 GMT):<br/>
Interesting paper. Ya even scaling linearly would probably become problematic over time, especially as the number of users grows (ie a single users share of the whole blockchain will get much smaller over time). An attribute-based accumulator sounds interesting...
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 27 May 2021 15:34:38 GMT):<br/>
I'm not sure there are even research solutions for this problem yet.
</p>
<p><strong>jacobsaur</strong> (Thu, 27 May 2021 15:59:56 GMT):<br/>
Gotcha, that's what I was afraid of. Thanks for thinking it through with me though!
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 27 May 2021 16:00:18 GMT):<br/>
Yep, of course!
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 27 May 2021 16:00:34 GMT):<br/>
If you're willing to have weaker privacy properties, you may be able to do things with searchable encryption.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 27 May 2021 16:00:44 GMT):<br/>
But it all depends on what privacy guarantees you need.
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 27 May 2021 16:01:11 GMT):<br/>
I may also pitch "attribute-based accumulator" as a research problem.
</p>
<p><strong>jacobsaur</strong> (Thu, 27 May 2021 16:01:28 GMT):<br/>
Are there searchable encryption functions in ursa currently?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 27 May 2021 20:31:55 GMT):<br/>
No.  Searchable encryption is not currently used in any blockchain applications of which I'm aware.

</p>
<p><strong>da3v21</strong> (Wed, 09 Jun 2021 02:17:41 GMT):<br/>
each subproof has an m_tilde for the link secret https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/blob/main/libursa/src/cl/prover.rs#L851 , I'm not able to find where they prove that m_tildes have the same link secret
</p>
<p><strong>MALodder</strong> (Wed, 09 Jun 2021 16:50:14 GMT):<br/>
because there is a schnorr proof that is the same for all the subproofs. because its the same you can assume the equality

The prover not being able to generate a false proof is called "prover soundness" and is a property of all secure zero knowledge proofs.
</p>

Hey! I had one more doubt. Does this code makes sure that the one who is generating the proof(the prover) will generate a proof for his real age and not a fake one, given that the prover has a verifiable claim for his age.
As while I was going through the tests of bulletproofs, I didn't find anything related to verifiable claims, it looked like a proof for 3 randomly generated numbers. Thanks. Highly appreciate the help.

Just think about what you want to prove.  You want to prove a statement of the form "I have a verifiable claim that my age is > XXXX" not just a statement about numbers.
</p>
<p><strong>SIDDHARTHJAIN</strong> (Sun, 20 Jun 2021 20:23:32 GMT):<br/>
Does this library allows us to prove these kind of statements. As in the tests section of bulletproofs, I could only see proofs for numbers. I'm sorry, my questions might be dumb.
</p>
<p><strong>SIDDHARTHJAIN</strong> (Sun, 20 Jun 2021 20:27:17 GMT):<br/>
Like I was going through the Sovrin Foundation's DID docs, which said that they implemented this verifiable claims (using ZKP) from ursa library.
</p>
<p><strong>SIDDHARTHJAIN</strong> (Mon, 21 Jun 2021 15:35:53 GMT):<br/>

```Specifically, the CredentialKeyCorrenctnessProof as generated by
_new_credential_key_correctness_proof (in the libursa/src/cl/issuer.rs
file) incorrectly uses randomizers generated in the range [3,p*q-1],
resulting in a compromise of the zero-knowledge properties of this
proof.

As a result, based on such a proof, an attacker can efficiently derive
the following information for the bases given in the public key:
 - Approximately the top 256 bits of the discrete log of Z with respect to S.
 - Approximately the top 256 bits of the discrete log of R[i] with respect to S.```

I've been asked to create a tag and release a new version of ursa that includes recent changes. @MALodder or @Dan can folks give me guidance on how to do this? Is there any reason I shouldn't?

The `bbs` crate no longer compiles, due to yanked version of the `crypto-mac` crate

```
error: failed to select a version for the requirement `crypto-mac = "^0.7"`

Hi guys, appreciate the works there. Sorry to interrupt but It looks like current ursa implementation only supports zero knowledge range proof, is there any plan or implementation to support set membership proof? Any pointer is appreciated, thanks!
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 11 Nov 2021 04:35:28 GMT):<br/>
You may be interested in this:  https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/pull/192.  It's not formally added yet, but it allows general ZK proofs.  Also, for set membership proofs, are you sure that you just don't want to use an accumulator?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Thu, 11 Nov 2021 04:35:34 GMT):<br/>
Thanks for your interest!
</p>
<p><strong>ChangmingLiu</strong> (Thu, 11 Nov 2021 18:44:38 GMT):<br/>
Of course! Thank you for the pointer, I'll have a look.  ```

``` yes, accumulators like merkle tree or RSA accumulator can be very helpful (anything that does the trick).  And yes, I saw related ZKP code in libzmix about these, but forgive me for failing to see an apparent way to apply them to the protocol in libursa e.g., how to ZK set membership proof about a value certified from the issuer.  I guess perhaps you're refering to section 7.2 in https://wiki.hyperledger.org/download/attachments/6426712/Anoncreds2.1.pdf ?  I'm wondering why this is not integrated into libursa(since when the verifier is sending predicate on a proof request, only <=, >= are supported.)   The protocol in anoncred v2.0 looks very promising, has this been implemented somewhere? otherwise, I'd love to help with integrating this.

Hi folks, I have seen different BBS implementations here and there but none seem to implement the complete suite describe in

Is that a correct statement? If not, I'd be grateful if anyone could point me the right way. Thx in advance!

<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 23 Nov 2021 18:32:38 GMT):<br/>
Answered on another channel -- basic answer -- BBS+ does not have the same features as AnonCreds.

Just noticed that you were mentioning AnonCreds 2 -- that also does not exist.

BBS+ does not have the features in AnonCreds v1.

</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Tue, 23 Nov 2021 20:07:15 GMT):<br/>
and when you say BBS+ I guess you are referring to 
https://identity.foundation/bbs-signature/
right?
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Tue, 23 Nov 2021 20:09:22 GMT):<br/>
because this
https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/663
and references show how to prove knowledge of a BBS+ sig that also includes link secrets
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Tue, 23 Nov 2021 20:11:28 GMT):<br/>
and this
https://github.com/IBM/idemix/
implements it
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Tue, 23 Nov 2021 20:57:11 GMT):<br/>
Not to say link secrets can't be done using BBS+ Signatures sometime in the future.  Rather, to say that it can't be done today, and AFAIK, there is no one working on making that happen.
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 07:15:08 GMT):<br/>
gotcha - thx again @swcurran !
</p>
<p><strong>wip-abramson</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 09:39:08 GMT):<br/>
Interesting. So all BBS+ credentials currently include a DID as the subject which the holder has to disclose to prove the credential was issued to them? Surely this compromises the fundamental reason these signature schemes were initially developed for - to support unlinkable presentations of credentials across multiple interactions?
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 11:09:10 GMT):<br/>
indeed.. what you still achieve is selective disclosure, so one does not have to disclose all the certified attributes. This may or may not be enough - given the threat model of the scenario
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 11:10:40 GMT):<br/>
surely over time, a set of colluding verifiers could do a nifty bit of profiling and reconstruct all attributes of a holder
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 14:59:42 GMT):<br/>
@wip -- I agree with you. There is a spec for BBS+ Bound Signatures that was written, but it hasn't been implemented and so is theoretical at this point.  

W3C VCs are very complex to deploy, so I think anyone using BBS+ is focused on just trying to get it to work -- to get JSON-LD behaving in a reasonable way.  We've found it very frustrating.
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 15:30:02 GMT):<br/>
the steps of 

i) having the issuer sign some commitment to a client secret and of 

ii) having the holder prove knowledge of that secret

are not particularly complex, so I'm guessing the complexity lies elsewhere. @swcurran do you know what they might be?
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 15:32:35 GMT):<br/>
Tobias Looker has presented a plan for doing the binding, but it has not been implemented.  Basically, the holder provide a public key to the issuer, and that gets used.   It seemed reasonable, but it has never AFAIK been implemented.  Not sure why.
</p>
<p><strong>swcurran</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 15:33:52 GMT):<br/>
We'd like to see it go a lot further -- to include the features of AnonCreds (e.g.  ZKP revocation at least, and ideally predicates) -- so even the BoundProof approach is not the best.
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 15:49:44 GMT):<br/>
right, that does sound reasonable
</p>
<p><strong>aso</strong> (Wed, 24 Nov 2021 15:50:32 GMT):<br/>
I thought actually that DIDcomm would have issues with the fact that at that point, the DID of the subject would no longer have to be included in the presentation

Hey all. I was trying to find out what cryptographic construction is used in `CL` for forming the `aggregated_proof.c_hash` and `aggregated_proof.c_list`? And do I get it right that the purpose of aggregated proof is to ensure that the proofs being verified were in fact generated together?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 06 Dec 2021 17:47:28 GMT):<br/>
An aggregated proof is usually a way of creating one proof that captures several other different proofs.  This can save on verification time and particularly proof space.  I'm not sure entirely what you mean by "generated together," sorry.

Hi, I'm trying to understand how inequality proofs in anoncreds 1 work. So far what I've gathered is that the prover splits delta into sum of four squares, creates a Pedersen commitment over each of those as well as the delta, and begins a ZKP for the commited values and the associated commitment secret. What I do not get is the purpose of:

$$
Q \leftarrow (S ^{\widetilde{\alpha}}) \prod_{i=1}^{4} T_i^{\widetilde{u_i}})
$$

Would appreciate hints on why this computation is necessary in the proof.

Hello, following also my post in #indy I am still looking at specific technical information regarding the key derivation mechanisms for both the wallet and the various agents communication channels. Is there any resource available beside the blog posts?
</p>
<p><strong>hartm</strong> (Mon, 31 Jan 2022 18:34:25 GMT):<br/>
You may also want to look at Aries.  Ursa is a cryptographic library, so it contains all the cryptographic protocols themselves.  Aries has the wallet software and makes the protocol calls.  Which layer interests you?  Do you have any specific requirements for key derivation?
</p>
<p><strong>mzago</strong> (Tue, 01 Feb 2022 08:43:16 GMT):<br/>
Hello, yes, I am also looking at Aries as, eventually, I'll have to figure out the keys derivation process for DID to DID communication. 
So far, however, I am looking at the process of deriving a key from the seed, which I understand is based on PBKDF2. I also understand that the DID is cryptographically associated with a private key derived from the seed itself, so I guess there should be a specific and deterministic way to obtain the pk and the corresponding DID via a key derivation process. Would you please provide some insight or documentation on this?

Furthermore, I'm having doubts about selecting the prime numbers p and q. In the documentation, it is stated that:
Random 1536-bit primes $p',q'$ such that  $p \leftarrow 2p'+1$ and $q \leftarrow 2q'+1$ are primes too. Then compute $n \leftarrow pq$ 
Aren't these restrictions too strong? In other words, where can I find information about why such primes must belong to that prices space?

2.  Those restrictions on the primes are unfortunately necessary.  You need prime-order subgroups and a "main" group that is a strong composite order group.  If you're willing to get technical, going through the proof in (https://dominoweb.draco.res.ibm.com/reports/rz3730_revised.pdf) might be a good way to see why this is the case.

does anyone have any recommendations for generating a header for the FFI::CL module? I tried using libcgen which seems to be what most people use but libcgen struggles with the module structure and repeated names. Thanks!
